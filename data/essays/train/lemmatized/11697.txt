definitely to travel with a group led by a tour guide is not one of the best option that can be taken . this is based on a bad experience that i have had with this type of travel . the disadvantage that the people ha if they choose the group travel are : - schedule need to be followed , what this mean that if you are in a great city like chicago and in the first day of the visit you found that what you most enjoy is the michigan lake , and on the second day on chicago you will want to repeat the visit to the lake you definitetly can not do it , due the fact that the tour bus ha a schedule and a route that need to be followed and the second day vist on chicago are the museum . - other disadvantage is that sometimes when you travel with a guide it is kind of tired due that the whole day you are walking . - next point is sometimes you do not like the way the guide doe the speach or the explanation of the visited location . - it is very important most of the time to know the group that you are travel with . this is beacause sometimes there are picky person that are too loud and it is something that you can not be dealing with , specially if the tour duration is like about a month . after all the disadvantaged menioned above , it is very important for people to do some research before booking a group tour led by a tour guide , where you can find people that will be taking the tour , the guide that will be given explanation , the schedule due that most of the time are very thight and boring that do not even worth it . summarizing the best way to travel is either alone or with a group of people that you already know . this give you a lot of advantage to really spend the time during your visit on activity that you will enjoy .
