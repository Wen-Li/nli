it is a common belief that advertisments make product seem much better than they really are , and for this reason they help making them look more desiderable . in my opinion this belief is true , and this is why a lot of investment are made on advertising . the first fact that make product more desiderable is the way they are presented . if the description underline the positive aspect of the product , and if it hide negative aspect of them , it is likely to happen that people would appreciate them . for example a beer may be advertised describing it flavour and it colour in a very positive way . besides to make it desiderable it should be presented not mentioning problem of alchoolism and driving accident . the second think that help advertisment to make it product better is the association of them with positive aspect of life . for example , when you advertise a kind of beer you can present it a the one drunk by very important people , or you can take a photo of a beautifull naked woman with your beer in her hand . the positivity of the person linked with the product is automaticaly transfered to the product itself by the receiver of the message . another aspect related to this subject is the absence of the product . when you are looking at an advertising image or a tv program it is probable that you have not that product nearby . when you see it , presented in a positive light , associated with a positive event , you want it . the absence increase desire . the desire of the product make it better simply because it is not present . for example if you see a beer on the television in a hot day , presented a a very fresh drink , by a beautifull young woman , you desire it . the desire make the beer much better than it really is .
