cars started to appear and rise early in this century , they were one of the greatest invention ever . they made life much easiar , contributed in the industrial revolution and made transportation several time much easiar and much more comfortable . cars made the world look smaller and made dream come true , i guess it wa the first step in globalization . but sadly nothing is perfect and everything should have disadvantage . cars work on motor which utilize fuel and give to the atmosphere unwanted , harming and polluting gas . and when we speak about the ozone layer and the global warrming , we should really underline the role those vehicle played in aggrevating the siuation . people can not give that invention away , no matter what and no matter what consequence we are going to harvest later on , just like smoking and all the other harmfull stuff . unless we think of giving people an alternative , for example the hydrogen vehicle or the once that use solar energy .. etc . when car started taking a shape in the world in the begining of this century most of the country started directing most of their source and income to bulid up the street , road , bridge , parking and they have department in each country just to follow upall matter related to that . so if we ever decided to give away car and all the other related structure , we will have to bulid up a whole new major structre for the new mean of transportation . although the idea of using the sky or the bottom of earth for example : the undergronuds and subway seems really successfull , but it doe not seem a practical and available a car . from my point of view , scintists are doning their best to eliminate pollution and save the world , and their effort are going to be rewarded by decreasing the source of pollution , if they can give alternative .
