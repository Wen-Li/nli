i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because i think both with and without a tour guide are different form and each one ha it difference on the time and money one have in order to spend on the trip . through my experience , i have learned that travel in a group led by a tour guide implies to adapt at the different situation and activity suggested ( or scheduled in advance when you book your trip ) by the travel agency and to the different interest not only personal but also of the other member of the group whom will be asking the whole travel to go to unscheduled place or to waste more time in somewhere else not mentioned by the tour guide , but you will be sure to spend your whole trip in place already planned and with a sum of money already paid . however , travel without a tour guide is more flexible in order to choose where you want to go and for how long you want to stay . in other word , you have the only responsibility of looking for information and taking care of your own , and of course of enjoying your journey . tha fact of going without a group doe not mean that you are exempt of loking for your own interest . while you are traveling , you have to realize that all you are doing , visiting , or discovering is based on what you want to do and no one else is there to tell you where are you going to go next and why . in addition to the place to go and the interest you have , it is going to be very important to realize how much money one ha , and how many time one want or is able to spend . not all the people have the same possibility in these topic and each one ( based on the roll each one ha in the daily life of oneself ) will have the exact answer to respond to this question . therefore , traveling with or without a tour guide is different and each one ha the opportunity to decide in which form is going to be the best way to accomplish one 's interest based on the time and money to our disposal .
