the world in which we are living today is shrinking . with the advent of computer and internet , it is possible to stay back at home and work . daily we are flooded with so much information . today , undoubtedly , information is the key to success . in this new environment , it is important that one should posse variety of information . lots of new opportunity are created because of these radical change . however , i believe that though variety in learning is important , specialization in one subject is critical for the survival . with the increasing competition , maintaining the superiority and growth potential in one 's profession is becoming increasing difficult . if you are not the best then somebody who is , will definitely replace you . it is particularly important in today 's scenario . there is a lot of change happenning around u . sometimes good and sometimes bad . consider an example of recession in the u.s it industry in the year 2001 . lots of software professional were fired and given pink slip in those day . however , those who had sound knowledge and degree behind them managed to stay back in business . consider an example of a doctor . if someboby is suffering from a heart problem and need an heart transplant , he will definitely prefer a cardiac surgeon and not an m.b.b.s who ha the knowledge about all medical problem . in short , some profession strictly need super specialized knowledge to be successful . if we are talking about primary education and even undergraduate study , learning many subject is of prime importance . however , when we taught about graduate study and work environment , it is extremely important to have specialized knowledge . i will summarize by repeating that a broad knowledge base is of no use unless we use it in acquiring specialization in one specific subject .
