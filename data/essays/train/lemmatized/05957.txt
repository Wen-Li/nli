i disagree with the statement . young people have hard time loving their life because of the stage of adolescence . on the other hand , older people spend their life a they want to because they are far more experienced than the young . i am a teenager , and i have seen a lot of my friend struggling in their life because they do not know what they should be doing . also , this is the time of adolescence where many teenager view the world differently from adult or child , and often become too emotional or revolting . for example , when i first enrolled in my high school , i wa very depressed . this wa because i kept believing that school wa a place where young people my age were being measured by the grade that they received . as i kept thinking that this wa a horrid idea of recognizing one individual a good or bad , i found anger in my self , and i could not enjoy my life . i also did not know what field i wanted to persue my career in , so i wa very confused and pressured . i think this time of my life wa a time of struggle because i wa quite young and did not have enough experience in life to make important decision . being young mean learning about life and going through different emotion . young poeple suffer internally and this is why i believe that young people do not always enjoy life more than older people . my grandparent are one example of why i think that elder enjoy life more than that of the young one . since my grandparent are both retired from their job , they have plenty of leisure time to spend . my grandparent travel every month to different place in the world . since they have earned enough money in their younger year , my grandparent are able to entertain themselves more than others . also , they have more life experience , which mean that my grandparent are able to figure out what is the most fun and benefitial to themselves . like this , i believe that older people can live a free life , doing whatever take them to be happy . young people often have to go through difficulty in their life , such a finding their true talent , peer pressure and worry on how they will survive in the `` real '' world . on the other hand , older people can live a relaxed life doing what they find the most joy in . they also have more experience in living , so they are wiser and know what is best for them . therefore , i believe that older people enjoy life more than young people .
