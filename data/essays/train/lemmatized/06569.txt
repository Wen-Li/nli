yes , i agree with the statement repsreesnted by this short phrase . this statement cite two important aspect of the learning phase that a student face when studying : first of all memorizing fact , and last but not latter , extract from fact the concept and the idea behind them . both are important in the learnig process , that can not be accomplished fully withount each of them : they are like two side of the same coin . although that , one of them is more imprtant than the other . the statement mean that student must not stop working and thinking when they have acquired the information presented by book or lecture , but they must go over , and gain a deeper comprehension on what they have memorized . i think that , when we start learning something new , it useful to begin from fact , that may be easy to remember and useful for fixing important data . so , we gain a fist impression , or a whole image of the topic , useful for further analysis . next , we must go on , because learning is n't only that : the student must pay attention on the concept behind the fact and data he ha learned . that data give u a background that must be used for building a deeper knowledge , that require each of u a harder personal work . only in that way we can obtain a more abstract idea of the field of human knowledge he is studing , and obtain a general view on the topic , broader than the one depicted by the fact he meet in the beginning . attendig a reading in a class , adn interact with professor and other student can stimulate thi process , and i think that after this work ha been ruled out , it becames easier to remember the concept : basing our knowledge only on fact , reading , and so on that where memorized can be an error , because in the long term our memory might not be good a in youth , and the hard work we have done can became
