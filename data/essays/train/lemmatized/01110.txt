i agree that in some situation this statement is true , but there are case where `` success '' can be defined doing a very good job in a specific area where you have very strong an well known ability , without to do someting new . i explain this idea making three example : 1 if you are a technical engineer that need to maintain a refinery plant in north sea during a normal activity period , you need to have very deep understanding on how it work and what kind of action you need to do to maintain it operating safely and efficently . so trying someting new is not required in this case , and you will be successful if you have minimum accident and maximum production . 2. if you are a businessman that need to compete in a very crowded market you need to exploit someting new to succeed . in this case trying someting new both about the conduction of the business and so on your personal ability is a risk but can be the only way to generate new business and so beeing successful . 3. if you are a doctor that need to help to recover from a cancer you can use new tecniques but have a solid background of protocol to be sure that the patient will never fall again in this illness . so your success come from a combination from new thing and well known procedure . so at the end i have exposed three way where beeing innovative , in the sense taking some risk and doing somerting new , can be a way for success or not . what is known is that the pepole work at best when the are working one someting new where still they can use his own previous experience , but this is more about efficency rather than success . success is dependent from the situation and so we need to take care what is the environment where we made our mesurement about success .
