i do n't agree because first it under condition law , second to able to make an effective advertisement need money . and that mean if you are successfull you have money and you can make advertisement . third if an advertisement is lying that will increase sale for short term . in long run consumer will chose the trustable producer . so the advertisement can'not be in sight in long run . first the advertisement are under control of law . it ha very big punnishments to lie costumer . everyone had paid attention to to the speaches at the end of advertisement like `` battery not included '' or `` each sold seperately '' . of corse that 's not the biggest example to the law about consumer protection . but they haveto tell people even if it 's just battery . my second arguement is money . if you want to make good advertisement you will need a lot of money . in turkey there wa a tv mafia serial named `` kurtlar vadisi '' . at the final of the serial sharon stone and andy garcia wa acted a the world mafia leader . and the producer paid 500 000 $ each of them . that mean 1 million dolars for one and half hour tv serial . producers efford this crazy amount of money from advertisement . and the firm make the advertisement are really big and successfull company . to became successfull you have to be honest to your customer . third if producer lie costumer it make the sale better at the test time . after then the sale will reduce . and every one will remember the company a a lier . do you pay attention how many advertisement we saw in a short time and we never heard this company again . this is like natural selection . if you are good you can live as the example company can not cheat the costumer by advertisement . exactly no one expect wing from red bull it a little bit commedy . everyone can understand that i think
