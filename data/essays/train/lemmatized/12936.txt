i dont agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people . the given statement can be accepted only to the extent of physical strength . the older people can not do all aspect of work physicaly a actively a young people can do . but in other aspect they can be on par with people . before saying how let me categorise different type of enjoying life . it could be in term of spirituality , philanthropy , through experience which come along with age , perception of life etc . an older person can how to relieve from stress compare to an younger person which lead to hapiness or unhapiness in life . well i believe that an individual can enjoy his life only when he ha peace . an older person can better deal the traumatic stiuations that every one face in life than a younger person . the younger person enjoys his life mostly through matrliastic pursuit which is only temporary and not the real joy . but at the most an older person who swam accross the age of youth is more inclined towards spiritual bliss . he is more religious and he can see the path between him and the god and that is the real and true joy . what is so sick about among people is that they dont have time to enjoy different aspect of life like nature , literature and art in their busy schedule of life of accademics and carrier . an yong person may not experience the same quality of joy a an older person can while jogging or listening to music or showing concern and understanding people come to them . what iiwant to conclude is that the definitio for enjoyment may not be same for all . each individual can enjoy life according to the way he perceive it . so i dont agree that young people enjoy life more than older people .
