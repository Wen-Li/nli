i do n't agree with the following statement : `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . '' i believe that they are in fact investing more time into supporting their community that their predecessor did . to raise a few specific reason regarding this point , they are a follows : first , thanks to political maturity and stability in korea , most of the korean student are not involved in the wild student movement any more . they purely think about their academic affair and building whole character through helping those who are in need . for example , it is often noted that many young stuedents visit the homeless people in the vicinity of their school and provide food and some medicine . second , the higher educational institution like university and college restarted the education of theory and the practice of ethical education . these school authority specifically have developed and initiatied multiple ` community support programs ' , and are encouraging their studednts to actively participate in them . third , the strength of the student ' community support activity are in that the student can enjoy sufficient time to help the community during their regualr vacation in summer and winter . moreover , many of thier parent and their school authority are not sparig any financial assistance for the people . fourth , from a systematic approach , it is very clear that almost all lower and higher educational institution throughout the country are focusing on graduating student of whole character . it is known that the student are , to some extend , required to plan and carry out their respective community support activity during the summer and winter vacation . also , a a matter of course , the school authority give credit to them . in conclusion , young people 's proactive participation into the community support activity is very much desirable societal phenomenon . their spirit and enthusiasm have to be further nourished and encouraged by every segment of the society .
