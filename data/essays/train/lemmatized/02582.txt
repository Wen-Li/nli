i agree with the statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' regardless of the field that a student is enrolled in , the main purpose behind the academic experience is for student to learn . learning come through understanding logically the law and concept associated with any topic . the difference between an idea and a fact is that idea have to be explained , illustrated and understood . facts on the other hand have to be accepted because regardless of a person 's opinion , a fact is a real solid statement . however , helping the student understand idea and law will make the acceptance and endoulgment of fact a much easier process . for example , when learning about human existance , it is a common well acknowledged fact that death is the end of any human . to help accept this fact , student learn from spirtual , religious and philisophical teaching the different explinations of creation , the reason behind life , the purpose of existance and the concept of after life . once a student truly understands these idea and concept and develops an explenation that meet his vision in life , it becomes much easier for him to accept the different fact related to human existance . nonetheless , stating that the understanding idea is more important than learning fact in not to take away from the importance of learning different fact . it is simply an arrangement of priority . a developed understanding of idea and concept will help in accepting fact , and once those fact are accepted individual start to develope opinion related to those fact . that is why it is highly important to learn different fact since it increase the student 's level of knowledge and awarness about the studied topic and help in shaping his individuality be developing his personal opinion .
