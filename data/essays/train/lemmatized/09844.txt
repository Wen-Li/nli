it is such a hard thing to predict whether in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there is today or not . there are so many factor leading to the decrease in the number of car . some of these factor are the ever increasing oil price , the scarcity of gasoline and the high cost of car maintenance . however , there are other factor promoting the use of car and thus will result in more number of car in the future . in my opinion , i think that the number of car wo n't decrease . in fact , i think that there will be more car in the future , than there are today . one reason that may lead to the increase in the number of car used , is the increasing number in population . the number of people is increasing world wide , and lot of country are having population control problem . so , the more people there is , the more the need for car and transport service . another reason is the advancement in science . scientists are finding new energy source that are abundant , le pollutant and cheap . having a cheap energy source decrease the running cost of owning a car , and thus encourages more people to purchase and own car . moreover , having this source a clean and not a pollutant for the air or the environment will make it easier in term of regulation to obtain a car . last but not least , the advancement in technology is another key reason . advancement in technology will increase the number of car significantly . with technology advancing , car manufacturer are able to lower their cost of production for car . thus , it will be possible to produce cheaper car in shorter period of time . also , the advancement in technology make it possible for government to be able to build more bridge and to maintain healthy road to accomodate more car . to sum up , its like a supply and demand issue . with the advancement in science and technology , resulting in increase in supply , and the increasing number of poplulation , resulting in increase in demand , owning a car will be easy and effective . so , in twenty year from now , there will be more car in use than there are today .
