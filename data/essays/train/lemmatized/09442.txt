is it more important for student to undersand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ? every idea and concept is based on a fact . some student are smart and learn by reading and understanging a new concept . some others take longer to undestand it . at the end , the slower student might memorize an idea or a concept , and might get an excellent score in an exam . but how will he apply this new knowledge to the real life if he never undestood what it meant ? learning a concept or an idea first will help you to use your imagination . the tutor will tell you a new concept to learn , explain you what it is , and follow up with a given definition . however , what will the result be if you apply it all the way round ? what will happen if you start by the observing the fact ( for example , watching some chemical reaction you 've never seen before ) . once you observe it , you come up with a conclusion , you get into the class and learn that what you have observed ha a name , followed up by an explanation of it , so you expand your reasoning and come up with your own idea of the concept . i believe reasoning is stronger that memory . memory get forgotten and reasoning stay . if so , concept and fact might get forgotten sooner than learning first the fact by experiencing and understanding it . by learning the fact first , you will end up learning the concept based on your own idea .
