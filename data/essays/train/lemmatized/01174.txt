i think that it 's not always possible to generalize on psychological topic so , personally , i would neither agree nor disagree with the statement . i would rather say that it depends on individual situation . take the case of a successful enterpreneur who built up a business in a steady industry without taking risk , and maximized his profit this way . from his experince he learned that thing go well without change . it is unlikely that he is inclined to change his mind after having success with not taking risk . although he 's successful ! or take the case of someone speculating on stock price . he ha learned , that if you hesitate too long , your profit will be below expectation since stock market underlie extreme fluctuation . such a person would take risk if he is successful . on the other side there are people who are inspired by their success to try out new thing . they are not satisfied with the goal they reached so far and thus think of themselves a capable to reach enw horizon . also , a they reach a certain degree of excellence , and build up stong basis of existing business relationship they become more confident to make a risky decision or try to walk a new path . there will be always that `` net '' to catch them if they fall . however , a personal relationship are concerned , i think that truly successful people who are happy with their partner , who have found someone they love , someone to rely upon , are unlikely to take risk unless there are desire buried deep inside of their mind . but it such case those people are n't exactly successful but rather hypocritic . in fact , success is often based on learning from mistake made in the past . the only way to make mistake and gain experience is actually taking risk and trying out new thing . this would support the idea that successful people are more open to risk since they know that the best learning is often learning from mistake , sometimes your own .
