i agree to the opinion that it is more imoortant for student to understand idea and concept than ot o for them to learn fact . understand in the idea and concept are the base to know the fact more deeply . for instance , if a history professor teach the fact of the art in ancient egypt like people made pyramid and buried king 's mummy in the tomb which wall were painted with narative story . it is difficult to understand why ancient egyptians made pyramid and burried king 's mammy , and the wall inside the room are painted with narative drawing . if the processor give student the concept and idea of why they made pyramid and burried king 's mummy in there , it is more fun to learn the fact . for instance , the pyramid are used a king 's tomb , and it wa the symbol of power at that time . inside of the pyramid are constructed to protect the king 's tomb . the narative painting on the wall are painted about the life of the king and god they worshipped which is for amusment for the king 's life after the death . if the student understand the concept and idea , they will understand deeply . also , it is easy to make them interested in the topic because they know the basic information ( idea and concept ) of the fact . in addition , they can learn fact independently because they know the concept of the fact like how it is made or what it is for . understanding concept and idea give student various way to learn the fact , and they can have own opinion about te topic . therefore , it is better to forcus on understanding concept and idea that learning only fact .
