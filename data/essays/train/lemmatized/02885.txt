i agreed with the statement . people who succeed try new thing rather than doing what they have already know how to do well . we will learn new thing and gain some experience by trying new thing . these experience are precious . we can only gain them when we tried ! and if it dose n't work or we are not satisfied with the result , we can keep on trying and trying until we are satisfied . i have heard of a phrase `` people who are successful find solution to solve their problem and people who are in failure try to find reason for their problem '' and i think this phrase really make sense . we should always find the solution to solve our problem rather than finding reason for the problem . for example , a man named tony . he opened a bakery selling only toast and water . plain toast and water . no one want to come to his shop because there are only toast and water . suddenly he decided to try new thing . he decided to learn how to make begels , milkshake and a variety of cake such a tiramisu and chocolate cake . he started to sell them after he have learned how to make them . after a month he earned lot of money after selling all these snack . he became a successful businessman . the reason why the man had became a successful businessman is that he tried new thing . and while he wa trying , he also learned . i do n't think the man will become a successful businessman if he did not try and do thing that he have already know how to do such a buying jam to put onto the toast or frying egg . these are just a piece of cake even a child from kindergarden can do all these thing ! there is also another example . if we lose a job , why do n't we try another or open a business ? we can always try and there will be a day we succeed . in conclusion , agreed with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
