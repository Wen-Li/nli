i think that 's right . young people do n't give much time for their community . i think this is mainly because of the today ' life style . we think very often in an egoistic manner , looking only at ourselves , without thinking of other 's that might need our help . i think it depends mainly on parent and society education that is given to youg people . today , we live in a fast and crazy world and there is not a lot of time for educational purpose . all the time is spent at work , or watching tv , or going around pub and so on and we forget the most important thing of life , like having respect of it or being happy for thing that life give u every day . for example , there are few people that would n't do a work for their community without being payed . an example may be the beach cleaning activity of some organization like wwf or greenpeace . that spend their time to clean our fun place . .. but there are very few young people that do that . an other example may be spend time for people that need help , like older people or that affected by a handicap . those people feel often alone and a little help would be surely appreciated . young poeple are n't interested in politics either , but politics is important because it ha much influence on our life . future society will consist of people who are young now , and because of this it is important to now thing enrolled in politics or in other point of view of our society
