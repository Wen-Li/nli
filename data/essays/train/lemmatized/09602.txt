i do not agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than old people do '' . many old people might enjoy life more than many young people do , since they know more about life because of their age , or they know that they are close to end so they want to enjoy it a much a possible before it is gone . enjoying life is not related to person 's age . it is more related to individual 's personality , or the life condition that individual ha , and the accident or luck that the life brings to an individual . i know many young people who are dealing with many problem of life rather than enjoying it . financial problem , or career concern are the main topic that make young people too much stressed about life . however , when we look at the old people , it is not hard to see on their face the scarces of satisfaction and awareness . they were slowed down , they ended the competition with other people , and just try to enjoy the life after accepting it a what it is . therefore , it would be invalid when someone claim that young people enjoy life more than old people do . mainly , enjoyment of life is mostly related with personality . in spite of many difficulty and the rapidness in their life , there are many young people who enjoy life . maybe , those are the one who can balance their enjoyment and responsibility . while they are holding a lot of hard work , they also leave some time to have fun , dealing with friend , family and social activity . someone might have a positive motivation of life , which make him/her optimistic about the fact , and lead him/her to enjoy the life . some others might have negative motivation that they only see the negative aspect of the fact and can not be able to enjoy life because of their motivation . some people might be too much concerned with the only `` responsibiliy '' or `` career '' part of the life that they do not allow themselves to relax , spend time with friend and experience the enjoyable and easy part of the life . to sum up , enyoying life is not related with the person 's age . it is more related to person 's character , the person 's perception of life . there are many young people who do not enjoy the life because of their negative motivation of life or because of the other priority in their life . there are many old people who enjoy life more than many young people do because their old age give them the awareness of life and the rapidness of time . and those motivates them to enjoy a much a possible when there is still time .
