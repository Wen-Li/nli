we should all know a little about everything , other wise we would be ignorants . it is true you ca n't learn about everything and sometimes should choose between what we want to learn , but more than anything i belive we should know many thing insted of closing our mind to what we only need . my step father , actor and every human living in this world can be used a example for this statement . my step father profession is music he life and bread music , but he know about every thing ! anythin you ask him he will be able to answer and this demostrates character , personality and good parenting . even though he doesent need calculus for his line of he ha used his knoledge of calculus to help his daughter and i with our home work . he shaires his knowledge with everyone and even though he doese n't need it , he pass it on to someone who doe . i aspire to be an actor when i go to college and being an actor is alot more than just acting and saying some line , actor need to constantly be learning , every single piece of information they can get their hand on they learn it , they might never use it , but it is there just in case . who know when he might land a role were he is alexander the great , good thing he read that history book when he wa in college , he ha to know about the character to characterize him . and of course every other human in the world . the reason i belive this world is so messed up is because we do n't take our time to learn , learn from the mistake in the past so we do n't make them again . ignorance is the destroyer of this world we live in , not knowing , `` bah , i do n't need to know about architecture ! well goverment . .. we just lost new orleans '' for being ignorant to the world around u we will some day , kill the rain forest , kill the sea with all the oil diging and destroy the world with global warming . we all need to know about `` stuff '' even though we ca n't know about everything , we ca n't turn the blind eye to the thing that are right there in front of you for you to learn about them . if we can make ourselfs smarter , get smarter and let knowledge in to your brain .
