i totally agree with this statement . indeed it is clear advertiser want to give a good image of their product and in advertisement the product seems better then in reality . in my opinion it is not amazing because the goal of the advert is to sell . that is why customer can only see the best aspect of the product . advertisers have to imagine a way to lure people . if it is a good advert , people will have lust to buy the product even if they are not very well informed . i think if product seem better it is because there is a lack of information for the consumer . besides it is not the aim of the advert to inform customer and sometimes advertiser overstep the bound of the product by showing some irreal situation . i mean sometimes the product is not the core of the advert but the goal is to show it and that people regognize it in shop . for example a famous advert for a shampoing conveys the idea that the product is pretty erotic . .. it is a weird way to use this product but if you are naive you can think it is true and you will be disappointed . thus product are more attractive if they are not ordinary and when people see the advert on tv it is always with handsome men or pretty girl . .. in order to sell dream . as a result the product seems always better when it is on tv . for instance a woman can see a beautiful skirt on a top model but when she will see it in a shop she will be disappointed . owing to the goal of the advert , the product is shown a something beautiful and even if it is an usual product , like soap or milk , many people will buy this one because they have seen it on tv although the product is not more different than another one . to conclude i really agree witj this statement because i think advertisement sell dream and it is not often the reality , that is why product seem much better then they really are .
