i truelly believe that the best way to travel is with a group led by a tour guide because this will save you time , money and will be more enjoyable than being by yourself traveling . one of the reason is because the tour guide know better the area and he will take you to the place that are more important in the area which you are traveling through . for example if i make a trip to brasil by myself i probably will not know what part i should visit because im not familiar with the area , and due to it i wont visit part that are tourist atractions . on the other hand if i go to brasil with a group led by a tour guide i will be definetly taken to the main visitor atraction due to the expirience and knowledge of the tour guide . another reason is that you will save time and money because you wont spend time trying to find place unknown for you due to the guideness of the person leading the group . as an instance , if you try to get to an unknown place while you are traveling by yourself you can spend more time asking the people where is that place located and also you will spend more money paying tax to get to that part that you are looking for . in addition if you travel by yourself you may get bored because you wont know anyone rather than if you travel with a group of person from your city or country because you may feel more familiar with them and it is a good way to meet people due to the time that you will spend with them . for example if you do a voyage to europe and you dont speak the language you may find difficult to start a conversation with someone due to the unknown language therefore you wont really meet people and you might start to feel bored due to it . as a conclusion , i can say that i rather travel with a group led by a tour guide rather than being by myself traveling .
