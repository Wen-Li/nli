the issue is concentrade if it is better to have knowlagde of many academic subject thahn to specialize in one speficic subject . i believe it is very difficuilt to awnser this question , because tere are many aspect which speake for booth of them . i think to have a specialize in one spefcific subject is important for an special job , like chemistry . it will help you to be good in this work and to have the kowledge . a bos in a firm or company would search for this special kowledge and i think you will have a good chance to get this job . the special kowledge is very usefull for you and you are an expert in a special subject . people would aske you for help and you are able to give a awnser , because you are good educated in this subjetct . but on the other hand you should have broad knowledge , because to have the chance to get a better job and people would respect you . in my view you have a better chance with a broad knowledge of a lot acedemic to get a good job in this world today . you have a better spectrum of knowledge and i think it will help you a lot . i think knowledge is power and that is very important . people would you more respect and you are only have a knowledge in one subject . you are specialize in more subject . in my perpective it is the question for what you need your knowledge and what for a job you want to do . it is your turn to specialize in one specific subject or to have a broad knowledge of a lot academic . in conclusion i would prefer to have a knowledge of a lot academic but in special job like chemistry you need a special knowledge . so all in all it depends from the choice of your job .
