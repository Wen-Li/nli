in my opinion , history is the most important science . the reason is that , it is both explains the idea that people were thinking of and the fact that had changed life forever . in that case it describes the perception of the concept during periodes of time , plus their effect on the evenements . in brief i think it is better to look in both side and then decide the reality of the statement . history class are usually based on knowledge of the fact . dates , people , location are important to know . if we memorise these material correctly we can also have general statement . for instance all the war were made because of different interest of state . so we assume that same kind of fact , like war , are enough for u to understand the reason or the concept of the war . in additoin to that it is easier to learn the fact than learning the concept . concepts and idea have many consequence or they have even not been realised . in short it is more general and easy to understand the fact for the student . on the other hand , fact are not usually enough for u to understand the reality . for exemple big state can make lot of war and can gain or loose land but these war can not explain clearly the reason why french revolution had realised . the idea and concept emerge and develope slowly and not easily . they have background and a search for a better life . in addition to that they can be capable of avoiding bad thing to happen . to give an exemple , people made war for many century but with the help of the philosophes or thinker they understand the importance of human life . so they do international agreement for not to battle . however , knowing only the fact is not enough the have a conclusion like this . to summurise we can say that it is more important for the student to understand the concept and idea then to learn the fact because it is more usefull for every situation . we can guess the fact in advance by knowing the concept .
