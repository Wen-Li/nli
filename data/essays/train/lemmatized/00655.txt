most of young people nowadays , for some reason like selfesh manner and the entertainment which is available 24 hour , dont really give enough time in order to help their community . first , with the availability of the t.v. twenty four hour a day it might be uncommon that a boy or a girl may think of helping his or her community . t.v. program , either good or bad one , attract young people , regardless of the movie , which take the first place of attracting the young in most country . this attraction may cause a little careless in theirselves toward their community . further more , the attitude play a huge part in this particular situation . it depends actually on the parent who should plant the love toward the society inside a boy 's heart ; for example , when you teach a child from his childhood how to love his country , it will be obvios that he will grow up up with a quantity of love will be indirectly translated into a care toward his country when he grow up , which mean giving some time to fix some mistake and help some people . in addition , the socity could lead a person to work and help his country and community and may not ; for example , if a person life in a generous , freindly , and ready to work together society , he would propably become helpful to his society sooner or later . the contrast is true , when the people in a particular society do n't care about each other then we should'n expect a guy show up and say he want to help . in conclusion with the avilablity of the entertainment any time at any place , movie which increase every day and the attitude of the person himself , the time for helping the community becomes rare . all these abstracted issue have directly or indirectly lead the young boy far a way from helping and lood after thier community , which is a petty .
