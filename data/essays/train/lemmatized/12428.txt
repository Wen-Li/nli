i disagree to the statement which promotes having better knowledge in many subject than to specialize in a specific one . the famous quote `` jack of all trade and master on none '' very appropriately support my opinion . yes , nature ha made everone equal and their is no difference whatsoever in our capabilties . what however distinguishes one man from another , are his quality & deed . although god ha gifted u all with similar capabities , he ha also blessed u with different interest & talent . i believe that one must specialize in a specific subject to form his own identity . today 's soceity is appreciative of selectively skilled personelle , who add to the growing global economy . a highly skilled person is welcomed to relocate in most developed country . this lead to upgradation of class & pay . such skilled peron take back to their country additional waetl what one person could achieve effortlessly could be another 's nightmare . this difference may not be only attributed to skill . interest in a particular activity substantialy make the person more keen & happier to do a job . this keep the pressure off him and make his achieve to the best of abilty . imagine a world with no specialist . do we settle for opinion about a fracture from an orthopedic surgeon or would we take a general physician 's word a final for it ? would a plumber be a good if he fixed your electrical fitting a well ? am sure the answer would be `` no '' . being a doctor , i have read through vast syllabus of human anatomy , physiology & biochemistry , about the basis of pharmacology , pathology , medicine , surgery and gynecology . though a broad knowledge of all these subject ha helped me understand the basis of origin and functioning of various body system & their anamolies , i would consider my education incomplete without the specializaton in a particular branch . we all have unique interest and it is impertive to take up one in order to thrieve in the today ' highly competetive work environment , where merely having a broad knwoledge is considered a basic skill and we compete with work force trained in specific task . a person 's interest in a specific field keep the drive to achieve higher & specialize in his subject of interest .
