i could not agree more with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge on many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i believe that people should have knowledge in many area because we face many problem and many situation through our life and if we have no idea about them we could face big problem . i am studying mathematics and i am learning everything about this subject at the university . however beside this subject i am attending many other course to improve my knowledge in other subject such a english , history , education and international relation . i am taking this course because i will be a mathematic teacher after my graduation and i will teach child . my main subject will be mathematics in my job of course but child will ask me many question in other subject , too . for example they will see something on television and a a teacher i will be supposed to have knowledge about what they saw and they will ask me some question . if i can not answer them in many situation they may loose their trust in me and this is a very bad situation for a teacher i think . another thing is that i am thinking about staying at the university a a teacher and in turkey one ha to take some exam to be able to stay at the university and to be an academic teacher . to be successful in this exam i have to have idea about some other subject besides my major subject . to improve my knowledge in this subject i have to be interested in them because it can be boring for me if i have to study something that i do not like and do not want to study . so , because of this reason i have mentioned above i am taking many other subject besides mathematics to improve myself and i believe this will help me to be successful in my job in the future .
