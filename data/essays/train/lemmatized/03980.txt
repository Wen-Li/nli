i would disagree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk . rather , i would prefer to describe the success a a result of being aware of one 's own potential , which is related with ` what people already know and and how to do well` . people can take risk any time in their life . in fact , risk taking is an open venture to all humanity . nevertheless , only few could manage to be called successful , because they knew what they would do . for instance , it 's hard to assert that , a person who ha an outstanding performance in the school but not social enough , will achive to be a well kown stand up star . if he tris his chance in show business , that would not be taking risk , but rather unrational , since the result would be catastrophe . if that student develops a brand new idea in her or his related subject , that would again not be risk taking or trying new thing . the project or the idea of a person derives from his or her capacity . considering the hyper rich people and inventor , success story are created and these are given a example to the public . however , there is no clear prescription of being successful that can be applied to all people . successful people are the people who could be able reach the knowledge of being their potential . as in our illustration , the student in the school , being aware of his potential in studying , is more close to be succesful .
