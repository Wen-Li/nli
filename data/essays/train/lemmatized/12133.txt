in a societey fixed on issue like youth and beauty , quite often people think that enjoying life is a matter of age , or better said a matter of not being old . when you look at tv commercial for example , you will find it suprisingly hard to find older people enjoying a joy - ride in the new range rover rather than young and good looking adult . on the other hand if there are report about the elder it is mostly about poverty or illness , or other issue old people are likley to get in contact with . but this is a many thing in our society a misleading thought . if one watch closer it is not that hard to find the complete oppsite of what wa written befor . a lot of old people actually enjoy their life , despite of the picture some might have of them . on one hand they have got a lot of time because the do not have to work anymore and on the other hand they use that time much better a the generation before them . a whole new market with special offer made exclusivley for elder ha developed . sports , travelling or social work is part of that huge variety . so enjoying your life is not a question of age rather than a question of willingness to do so . there are of course a lot of older people who would call there life boring and not very enjoyable but you will find young people with the same opinion . as a matter of fact the whole issue of enjoying life is a question of your finacial background a well . it is obvious that for some older people it is hard to get along with their small pension a it is for young unemployed or under qualified people . taking these idears together you will come to the conclusion that young people do not enjoy their life more the olders do or the other way around . being old is no reason to have le pleasure living , and being young is no free - ticket to happiness . so basicly enjoying life is up to you , because if you are not making the best out of what you got , nobody will do .
