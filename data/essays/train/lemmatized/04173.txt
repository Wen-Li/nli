i believe that in the future fewer car will be in use than today . the human population on earth is growing rapidly and this is reflected in every major city of the world . as the metropoles get crowded the quality of life decline in that city . today among the biggest problem of city such a paris , ny , london and istanbul is the traffic . city official are offering their citizen to use alternate way of transportation such a subway but due to the much crowded population , the chaos of traffic doe not seem to end . the istanbul mayor once proposed to have restriction on the number of car to be out on the street but it wa not considered since it would be interfering with the right of the citizen . more proposal are being worked on . this problem had a reflection on the automative sector . if we take a look at the recent year , we will see that smaller car are becoming in-demand more and more . small car are seen a , if not permanent , but effective solution to the parking and traffic problem in the major city . in twenty year , i would like to believe that this problem will be solved and there will be more alternative way for every day transportation . therefore the usage of car will be le than today . cars also are said to be a danger to environment . it is proven that fuel gas and motorine are harming the ozone layer therefore endangering the environment . many car company are working on project where alternative engine are produced to halt this . most powerful brand have either completed project or ongoing test to build car that can work with water , electricity even sun . however nothing is said to replace the usage of fuel financially . it is still the cheapest way on the market that 's why the alternative engine generation will not be a widespread a quickly a the environmentalist hope . however these 2 reason i stated are strong enough to make me believe the usage of car will be fewer in the near future .
