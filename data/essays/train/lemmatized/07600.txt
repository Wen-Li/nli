i agree with the statement given . there will be decrease in the number of car in use over the next twenty year . this is because of several contributing reason which include growing traffic problem , depleting petroleum resource , invention of newer mode of transport , and several other reason . firstly , the traffic problem in today 's roadway is a major contributing factor . the remedy for such problem would prove more costly than inventing a new transport method or developing an alternate transport method . the possible cure for today 's traffic hazard and traffic jam could be building more overhead bridge . the building of bridge in existing city premise need a lot of fund and planning . on the other hand if these effort were made in the direction of improving railway commuting facility or metro train facility , it would be more fruitful . the invention newer mode of transport like small range air vehicle or helicopter for transport in the city would facilitate easy a well a faster solution to such traffic problem . depletion of petroleum resource also ha a major role to play in retarding the manufacture of car at this rate . petroleum good are used for various other purpose like industrial usage and cooking etc . but today most of the petroleum resource are used up in automobile industry . to change this scenario , the number of car would have to be drastically reduced . alternate energy source like hydrogen fuel cell car , electric battery car have not been very successful . therefore the number of car after twenty year would certainly be a small fraction of the present number . the technology and development which enhance the efficiency of car ha almost come to a point of saturation . cars now are bought more because of their beauty in design or brand of the maker , rather than because of their efficiency . even this support that if there are newer and more fashionable mode of public transport , more and more people will want to commute by those vehicle . therefore by looking at the present trend of car design and keeping in mind the depleting resource , i strongly feel that the number of car in use after twenty year from now would be very few . new invention could easily substitute the automobile in the near future .
