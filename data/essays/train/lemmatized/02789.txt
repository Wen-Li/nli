is it more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ? i strongly agree with the statement for three reason . understanding idea and concept is important for development of student ' ability to apply , to care for others , and also to come up with question and theory . first of all , without idea and concept , student can not use the knowledge in daily life . for example , let 's say there is a boy who ha learned the pythagorian theorem but ha never been taught how the mathematician came to the theorem . he doe not know where and how the fact came from , therefore is unable to apply his knowledge for some similar but different problem . secondly , i believe that the sense of moral issue can only be developed through vast knowledge of idea and concept . to understand how people act , student have to know idea and concept about human mind rather than fact , because everyone is different . if student are taught moral issue a fact , not a concept , they will likely to stick with that idea and not able to think of other people . the last and probably the most important reason is that understanding idea and concept well may lead the student to develop with further question and theory . knowing where and how a fact come from give the student better understanding about the fact . moreover , further investigation using concept will lead some of them to find fact that have never been discovered . development of theory is definitely due to well-understanding of idea and concept . some adult , even the teacher , insist the student learn fact rather than understand idea and concept . i strongly oppose to that opinion . as i stated , understanding idea and concept result in student ' ability to apply knowledge , to understand moral issue , and to come up with question and theory .
