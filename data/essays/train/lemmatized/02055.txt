i agree it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject for many and different reason . in the first i have many possibility to speak with the other person because the knowledge many subject will do of me an intresting person . moreover to study many subject permit to me to know different person and different thing . this is very important for my future because i have many possibility for my life , for my job , for my hobby , etc . for my job , for example , to know different subject is very important because ti is an intellectual job and if i will specialize in one specific subject i will not become a good architect . to specialize in one specific subject mean that i am a limited person . the knowledge of many subject is the most important thing for the growth of an individual , the intelletual 's growth , because a person can to become a bad person , while he is an intelligent person he will ha n't the difficult with the social relationship . to understand my topic i have an example : my father started to work when he wa a child , but when he became a man for his culture and to create the future he started to study and now he is a manager of heating sistem . now the younger have many possibility for to study immediately with the school , with numerous book , with the tv and with the newspaper and therefore because it do n't do it . in the end , it is very bored to study only one subject because the time do n't never walk !
