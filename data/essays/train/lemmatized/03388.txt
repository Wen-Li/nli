each day , numerous new product are welcomed by the market and the need to promote a specific item among these huge inflation of consumption attraction stimulated advertisement sector to be one of the most fast growing sector of the econopmic system . keeping in mind that the main role of advertisement is to make product look much better in order to sell more , i agree very much with the idea that advertisement might sometimes lie for some eligible reason . first of all , one should remember which context we are talking about . it is highly developed capitalist society , where consumption ha become in such an intrinsic way that the competitiveness within the market is incredible , nevertheless the product have more or le same quality . therefore , it is indispensible for advertisement to make product seem more valuable than they really are in order to look like making a difference . obviously , we all imagine that this new kind of toothpaste that we watched on tv would not be so different from the previous type that we use every day . or prepaid soup doe never look a delicious a appears on tv nor doe it taste any better from my mother 's natural recipe . although i understand the reason why advertisement might be mistaken , i contend that some of the advertisement go a far a violating customer 's right . for instance , most of the time the long advertisement on fitness equipment present the product a the most efficient one ever existed on earth and the ad also relies on the former customer ' testimonial in order to assure new one . i regret to say that most of time , these people recommending the product happen to be amateur actor , not happy customer . this is an example where innocent people 's time , money and energy is exploited . i remember my mother once buying such a product and realized how worthless it wa . to conclude , i would like to call people to be more careful about advertisement and never forget what they are seking for . i guess this difficult situation is the inevitable kind of life provided by cunsumer society .
