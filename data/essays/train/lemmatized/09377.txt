i not agree with the statement that say that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than today because of some reasonable reason . the main and most important reason i have to defend my opinion is that in twenty year the popullation would growth a lot , and not only in africa where the birth-index is enormous also in europe and in all america , and this is going to occur because of the inmigration , it could be legal or illegal , but all the country are going to suffer the inmigration and migration proccess , instead of the law and other inpediments government will try . the second reason why i feel there are not going to be fewer car in use in the future is that in twenty year scientist are not going to be able to find a new and innovate transport method , like flying car or what else some people think we are going to have in few year . yeah , it 's true that some scientist have made a flying car but in the case they can comercialized it , it is going to be so expensive for the mid-people , so they are going to use the traditional car . the last reason i am going to talk about is not a important and relevant a the two others , it is the comodity . nowadays the comodity is a very important factor of our society , all the innovation in technology or in other subject are to make more comfortable our life . moreover , we create thing not to thinking more about what to create , those thing we have create are going to do that job instead of u . to sum up i have to say that i feel it is ridiculous to think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
