the problem of the pollution is one of the most one of this century . one important cause of this problem is the substance that the car trasmit in the air and so it is necessary to find a solution . according to me , twenty year are not sufficient to reduce a lot the number of car but this is the only way to solve the problem . in italy the public transport are not already the best way for going somewhere . a lot of student or worker have infact to use the car because the mean of trasport are not effecent or there aren t any . to see few car on the road so , the governament have to do a serious politicy to increase continuosly bus , subway . .. nowadays in fact the traffic is getting higher and higher also because every family ha two or three car , to reach the place of work or study and only with adeguated and not much expensive mean of trasport the car will left home . so , a the traffic is increased from past to today , will continue to increase also in the future if the governament wouldn t be able to stop this cycle . but also the behaviour of common people have to change to solve the problem . if someone have to reach a near place may go on foot or use the bicicle instead use the car for doing 100 metre . moreover specially in the biggest city a milan , where the public trasport are efficent , people sholdn t use car to move in the city . so , according to me it will be very difficult to see le car in the nex future because the goverman have not only to increase the public trasport but also to change the mentality of a lot of people .
