i think the product we see on tv ad , newspaper , magazine and billboard are usually exegerrated , but this is the point of an advertisment , to make u believe that we really need that product or that product will solve all of our problem about whatever that product is for . this is basically the heart of the capitalism . one of the example of overrated product is the fitness tool , which promise the consumer to have bigger muscle or to lose weight . these ad want u to desire to be like the people we see on these ad and then they convince u that we can be exactly like them if we buy their product , a if that product magically transform u into the person we want to be . the trick they usually use is to show photo of people before and after they used their product but these photo are often fake one . another example for the misleadind advertisement can be the ad that try to convince consumer that their product will change our life in many way . this time the trick they use is putting a lot of meaning to one item like that product defines who we are , who our friend are , etc . as a conclusion , advertisement and are used for two purpose by company , to make u desperately desire their product and to cover a really bad product .
