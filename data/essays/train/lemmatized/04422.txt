i agree with the statement that the sucessfull people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . this is the human nature to find new way of life . his intention are to increase the more and more knowledge and learn more skill . right from the evolution of the humanity , they are inventing the new thing and bringing the best metods to improve the life . it is only due to the risk taking ability that we are in the age of the modern technology . if no one took risk in the life there will be nothing now . you can not say that the new technology are available without risk . in this era , we can'nt think without the electricity , aeroplane , satalites and the medical facility . all these facility are achieved by taking life risk . there are sevral story of the successful person who achieved all with thier risk taking ability . for example the right brothers who invented the aeroplane . they become the inventor by taking the risk . as people say `` satisfaction is death '' . this mean that we have to find the new way of life . we should not stagnate with the old method and skill . we have improve them or change them . we can achieve every thing . nothing is impossible in this world . peoples are trying to find new horizon in the life . for example now they are trying to find the new planet to live . human is different due to his brain power fropm other animal and with this power he eliminates the impossible word from his life all in all , to get the new thing you have to take the risk . this is the human naure to take the risk and find new path which can lead him to the new height .
