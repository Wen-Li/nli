i completely agree with this statement . there is no doubt that the advertisement do make a product look much better that they actually are . we should understand that the adverstisements are aired to make consumer familiar of a product and to promote it sale . if a company ha launched a product it ha to have maximum sale in order to have profit . so , they try to attract the attention of the comsumers by projecting it a the best product available in the market . every company advertises it product a a super product a if no other product would ever be able to beat their product in term of quality and price effectiveness . i feel that they try to fool innocent people for their own intrests . these day , company project the research about the product . they just project the good quality of the product and hide the negative one to mislead people . for example , they wiill air that the study have established that their product is better that the product a , b , c and d in x , y , z parameter but they will hide the other parameter the product is not good in . i feel that a good quality product doe not need any fancy advertisement , it quality speaks for itself and such a product will become popular with population just by word of mouth . according to my feeling , making a decsion to buy a product just because it is advertised a a very good product is utter foolishness and a waste of money . i , myself have been a victim of fancy advertisement . but , i learnt my lesson of not going by advertisement by incurring heavy monetary loss . i now feel that it is resposibility of individual to protect themselves from falling into the trap that company lay to extract money from consumer by advertising .
