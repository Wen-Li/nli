although some people belief that the young people enjoy life more than the old people do , i do not agree with this statment . however , at my point of view , i believe that the enjoyment is not related any more to the old of people . so many reason can support may point of view . in this life , there are many thing that can enjoy people . these than are differ from people to other . for example , the child will enjoy with playing the computer game . but , when they become a lettel bet older they will enjoy with other thing like playing football . by the year , there way of entertainment will vary according to their age . another reason that support my opinion is the diffrent circumenstances for the people . some people wa sad during their youth and become happy when they are oled an vice versa for other people . this is becuase of the surrounding envirnoment . one the other hand , some people belief that the young people enjoy life more than the old people do . they supporet their idea because the uouth ha agood helth . also , they have a better ability for doing thin \ s more that the old peopl . but this will not be true alowas . at the end , i would like to say hat the enjoyment of the life depend mainly on the person himselm rather that on his age . so , i would like to say to the people . live yor life this the good
