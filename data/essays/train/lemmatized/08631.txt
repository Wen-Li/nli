i believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today because using car could pollute the environment and make people have le oppotunities to exercise . using car could hurm and reduce nature that we live in and is essential for u to live . as a lot of people know , driving car could make co2 , which is found to raise the temperature of earth . in the fact , co2 is considered a one of fron gas that could cause greenhouse effect . this is a effect that fron gas that we use in our every day life cover the earth and prevent it from releasing the heat from the sun to the space . it is the fact that the the temperature of the surface of the earth is more and more raisig today , which already cause flood or drought . the act that is producing co2 is actually said that driving car , so if use keep using them and producing co2 , we do not know how much it is going to affect on the environment negatively . therefore , we have to come up with better ride other than car . more and more people have le oppotunities to exercise because of car . nowadays , there are lot of people who do not exercise enough and who eat junk food like humbergers or pizza . i understand that poeople are too busy working or going to school beacuse they have to earm money for their family and to study to learn a lot of thing which are good for them . however , eating junk food and not exercising surely kill themselves . i know a person who us his car when he go to a grocery store to get food although it is just 5 minute far from his house . i strongly think that he can walk , no , he ha to walk . if everybody ride a car wherever he or she go , they are surely going to be out of shape and get disease like heart attack or diabetes . i blieve that we should use le car and walk or ride bicyles if the direction are not so far away from we we are . there are two reason why people use lea car . one is that using car could harm the earth because of co2 that car produce . the other one is because using car make people have le oppotunities to exercise .
