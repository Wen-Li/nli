i agree to this statement that successful people try new thing and risk rather only doing what they already know how to do well . it is tru about this statment that people who are success will never ever think that they will not get through any problem in life . when you have a possitive attitude in life you will really do good in your future , without risking your life we will not able to reach the destiny . i like to giv e an example ; one of my friend tried to pas a exam , he tried several other way to pas a exam but he wa unsucessfu all the time . he ha given the same exam sevaral time but he wu all the time unsucessful . when i saw that he wa not able to pas the exam after giving several time , i asked him what are you doing , what happened , he replied that i tried to cheat , copy from friend and i tried all type of trick i can but noting worked . now i suggested him it is not easy to pas the exam , you should lot of deddication and hard work is needed . it is not a easy wory , if you make up your mind that i will do it at any cost than you will see one day you will pas the exam in very good mark . i disagree with th above statement that why shoud some one would risk the life to achive some thing in life . i dont think that it will be a good idea to loose your life to achive something in lfe . so always sugest that not only sucessfull people or anybody in lfe should risk the life to be the best in life . it is prowd when you become sucess in life , you can always be an example to others .
