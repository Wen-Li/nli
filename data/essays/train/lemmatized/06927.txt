the statement at hand is a very dabatable one and may have reader split depending upon his or her view about the future . a person who is pessimsitic about the future or not very updated with the latest development in technology may have his view split with a person who is updated with the latest news and technology advancement . by looking from a pessimistic point of view a person may agree that with the growing demand of oil , not failing the mention the increasing oil price one would suggest that the oil reserve would be over in few decade or the price of oil would shoot up far too high for the common man to afford . both of the assumption lead the consequence of fewer car being able to run on road . however being optimistic i would look at it from technological perspective where technological advancement could replace oil by a commodity which is more abundant in nature ; water for example . since earth is covered with 3/4 's water and water is made up of oygen and hydrogen ; it defintetly ha the ingredient a futuristic fuel . moreover i feel we could have lesser in another way i.e car be replaced by hovercraft which would reduce ground traffic by enabling one to travel through air . in my opinion the quantity of car would not become le ; a continous advancement in technology will definetly provide solution to the existing fuel problem .
