i agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . i support the above statement because younger people have the capability , vitality and vigour to do thing than what older people can do . i can explain this by following example . firstly , considering the present situation of technolgical development taking place and day by day the world market is being stormed by a variety of innovative gadget . younger people have the edge over older people for enjoying these product . young people have the strong inclination to use these product which the older people may not pose due loss in intrests in the worldly pleasure . secondly , considering the example of learning , younger people are exposed newer innovative idea and newer discovery being made . by learning these thing they can come to a better understanding of the present situation of their society which ultimately lead them to create a better enjoyable life of their own . where a the older people may lack the interest of learning new thing which may be due to their old age or due to a prejudiced feeling that they know everything . finally , considering the biological aspect younger people can do a lot of work than the older people can do . while doing the work of their interest young people can enjoy that work a the physically they can subject their body to stress . where a considering the old people , even they have interst to do some work the physical condition of their body may not cooperate for doing the work . in addition young people tend to be more healthy . so , they can enjoy different type recepies whereas it is not possible in the case of older people who are more prone to health ailment . considering the above stated three example i think that i wa able to justify my statement that `` younger people enjoy life more than older pople do ''
