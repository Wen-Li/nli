some people think that old people ca n't enjoy life the way young people do . but , personally i think they can for the following reason . most importantly , the age doe n't matter . if the person kept on mind that he want to have a good time and live a happy life , he will do and find the pleasure in alomost any situation . nothing that the young people can do the older ca n't do it . it depend on the person himself . for example , when i wa young , i used to go to the public park with my grand father . we had such a great time that we want there every weekend . we enjoyed playing dangerous electronic game . even though my grand father wa in his fifty he wa stiil young and able to enjoy his life , while my father wa vary young , but he spenjd all of his time in his office working . in addtion , old people have more expriences in life . they are usaully wiser and know how to spend thier time . in today 's modern society , young people are almost wasting thier time doing useless or harmful thing . they do n't have enough experience to do the right thing or to know how to spend thier time in a good way . in other word , the expriences of the old people will help them to know the right way to enjoy thier life . another reason is that young people have more responspilties . they have to study or to work . whereas , old people do n't have to work a mush a the young do . most of them have finished thier study . also , there child are grown up and started to depend on thereselves , so they have more free time . in conclusion , i tend to think that older people enjoy thier life more than young people . they finished thier message in life , so they have the time and the experience to enjoy thier life better than the young people do .
