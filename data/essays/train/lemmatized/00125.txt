i agree to the statement that yound people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i think that they are not likely to join the community event , they are not frequently share the burden of the community and it is not often that they help the neighbor who are in need . first example of this is that young people nowadays do not join event that are held by support of community such a festival and community meeting . there may be several reason to be claimed by them . they may be very busy for working , they may have moved from their hometown and may be not familiar with the community . whatever the reason is , it is true from my experience that the younger the people are , the le frequent they will join the community event . another example is that they are not likely to share the burden with community member . for example , when the community ha a rule that every member need to go on a patrol by turn , there could be a case where only middle-aged and old people work a assigned . younger peple are reluctant to serve for their own part probably because they are busy , or they are just selfish . moreover , it is not frequently observed that young people help the neigbors when they are in need . even though one of the family member dy , young people who live next to such family will not help them or , in extreme case , will not pay any attention to them . this can be partly explained that people ha become more personal than social and it would be helpful to keep privacy . this can be a good example to illustrate that young people will not give enough time to helping their community . as these example a mentioned above , low frequency to join the communiy event , unwillingness to share the burden with community member and unlikelihood to help neighbor show that young people give insufficient time to helping their community these day .
