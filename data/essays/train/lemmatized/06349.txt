according to the statement , that it is better for student to understand what they learn , namely the concept and the idea , rather than learning fact by heart , is convincing to me . in general it is more effective to a student to learn idea and concept , a they will last longer in their memory . i can emphasize this by my own experience , a it s very difficult to memorize fact . learning date for instance for a history course doe not help a lot in understanding why historical event happened or what effect they could have on our contemporary time . facts also doe not help the student in the future , when they leave the university . when entering the job world , it is much more helpful for a student to know the basic concept and idea , which he or she can apply in his or her job . taking the example of the history course again , it would be more logic , if the student learn the main difference between the epoch or the essential research method , which historian need to accurately do their work . the study should provide a framework , within the student can work by their own . some lecturer would argue that it is nevertheless important to know some fact . i agree with that , but learning fact should not be the main part of the class work . there should be rather more interchanging action in the class , so that maybe old concept will be discussed critically and new idea can develop . understanding the idea and concept provides the student with the ability to use them and work independently . this should be the prior aim of every university , namely to educate the student to an independent thinker .
