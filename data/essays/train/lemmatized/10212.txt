i agree with this statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in our life the advertisement are almost everywhere , you can see them on newspaper , tv , wall , car and subway . when you see the product on them , the product look so nice . everyone want to buy them , but when you got them , they did not seem better than advertisement . the frist reason that i think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for example some advertisement on tv , they look so nice , so people will to buy these product , when they got the product , but it is not so good . thus some people will make more money . the second reason that i think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , most advertisement are made by a lot people . they know how to make product better than they are really . so people like to buy them . the third resaon that i think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , some product do not really good , if they do not make the advertusements better they will sale a few . so people spend more money on the advertusements so they can sale more product , they will make more money than before . successfully when we know that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . we can buy some product that we really need . do not buy those product seem better on the advertisement . so i agree with this statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
