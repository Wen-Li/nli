it seems strange but also before this text i wa speaking about this problem with some of my friend . in particular we discussed about the case of milan a very famous city , that is located near were i live . this city ha a lot of problem and one of them is the traffic caused by car . immaging that this city ha normally one million of inhabitans , but everyday more then one million and half people , arrive at the city for their job , and most of them driving their car . during the last century a lot off chages happened , if we consider that car or better the motor wa discovered at the end of the 19th century . the reason of this problem could be found at the middle of the 20th century were the possibility to have a car were a status symbol . i can not affirm if in twenty year there will be fewer car then there are today , but i am sure that it is neccessary to do something to change this situation , not only for the quantity of traffic but for the consequence that this pollusion ha on our environment . the very big problem especially in italy , is caused by the terrible condition of our national system of transportation , i am speaking about old and often dirthy train , pullman . . that do not cover the real necessity of the people . i think that this is the right way that the institution and the governaments a to follow , because without investiments nothing could be change . we should study alternative system of trasport incresing the use of modern and faster machine a the magnetic train already in use in germany and china , or we just have to give a look to the past a some countryes done , reintroducing the use of pratic and . . bycycle
