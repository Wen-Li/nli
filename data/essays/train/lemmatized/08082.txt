the ability to understand idea and concept could be considered the base of education . this skill is necessary to learn effectively fact and rule , but also to develope own opinion and draw consequence on what learned . for example for schoolchildren , learning the mechanism that are behind the basic rule of mathemetics , is the first step to be able then to solve problem and find solution . it 's therefore important that they understand what it mean , for instance , adding number , before knowing the result of the operation itself . facts and rule learned without knowing their significance risk just confusing student , who may have a lot of information , but can not organize them into a logical framework . the further you go with the level of education , the more important ability , other than pure knowledge of fact , will be . fore instance , while writing a thesis in higher education , you start from reasearching and collecting material and information from many source , but then what really matter , and what you will be evaluated for , is your own contribution : developing idea from fact that are just the base of a complex study . i would also add , that nowadays , the internet made a lot of information easy accessible to people . what is important then , is finding the relevant information , organizing and developing it . remembering fact , data , number , is not anymore so important when a lot of source are available and so easy accessible . unlike the oral-based culture , where memory wa essential for knowledge , today other skill are becoming more and more important . i think that understanding idea and concept , mean also being able to understand people , different opinion and choice : it is not just studying , it also help to live and handle cultural conflict that are inevitable in the multicultural society . therefore the capacity of understanding other point of view , is more and more important to manage the cultural difference , which is now part of our life , and which i believe , in most of the case , represents a richness .
