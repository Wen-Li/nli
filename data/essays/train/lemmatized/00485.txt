i agree with the statement of idea and concept are important over learn fact . with proper analysis of the idea and fact one can learn fact out of them . ideas can form the basis to learn new fact about the particular area which you are about to know . concepts are much more important for the development of the fact . in real life fact about the life , it existence are developed by concept of science . researchers are spending huge amount of time and money to learn fact about the betterment of the life from the concept and idea that they got . now-a-days there are somany medicine and vaccine are developed to cure different disease held with humanbeings . to develope these drug concept and idea are basis for the chemist and biologist in developing these . not only in disease curing , in the investigation of a criminal case , investigator us the idea and develope concept to trace the fact about the case . ideas are back bone for the developing new concept to trace the fact . so student should develope to improve their knowledge towards understanding the new concept and explore their idea . ideas and concept are just like fundamental of a subject . if one with fundamental can learn new fact in the subject using those fundamental . without fundamental knowledge one can not go to the destination . ideas and concept are not visible but the developed fact from them are visible a publication in the article . many science and art publication are publishing the truth developed by researcher developed from concept and idea of subject matter only . these day are globalizing . world is comming out a a villiage . in this fast track society student with good concept and idea can frame their path beautifully . only learning fact can not develope one 's internal subject . the student with conepts and idea can go for research and develope new fact about the subject matter and can deliver to the betterment of the society .
