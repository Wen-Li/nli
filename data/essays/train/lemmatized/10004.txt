advertisements have been the mean of selling a product for a long time . advertisements are not only been used in the modern era it ha been existant even in the past world . in past , where the modern mean of advertisement wa not there , there were place where the art work and thing that are to be sold were exhibited where the artist or the seller used to talk about his work and sell the product . but in the modern world there are many mean of selling a product through televison , internet , newpapers advertisement . i do agree that most advertisement make their produts seem much better than they actually are . many company who sell their product though do give the detail about their product at the same time they give in the detail that may be false or of a very little importance , or may not be actually useful to the consumer . and most of the time they use celebrity personality to sell their product which itself is a mean of providing a false information . for example , a advertisement in which a celebrity is shown using a soap or a cosmetic product . is that product really used by that celebrity ? advertisements do not provide with complete information of the product . for instance , while selling some doll or toy for kid , they are advertized in the televison a they move by themselves and show them in a huge size which is definitely not the size the real toy might be , kid get facinated with such advertisement and kid get disappointed when they get to see them or play with them . a simlar example can be presented with advertisement show for the various food place , where they show a enlarged vision of a food item making it more appealing and colourful , though they do put in miniscule unseen asterix mark and inform at bottom a it being an enlarged vision which is missed out by most of used . but ia also agree with the fact that unless such a kind of advertisement is not done the consumer can not be attracted easily . though there is so much of advertisement done if the quality is not god the consumer can never be convinced . so i agree with the fact that advertisement make product seem far more better than they really are .
