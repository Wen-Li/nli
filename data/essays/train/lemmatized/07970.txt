the influence of marketing in our society ha been enormous in the last few year . the practice of publicity also ha changed dramatically . from my point of view , company exaggerate the personality of their product in an outlandish way . this is unfair for the consumer who believe in the authenticity of the advertisement and the message that buyer are getting are not true . first , people most of the time are getting message through the medium that something is really well develop and it quality is not comparable with nothing else . this is not right a people think that the message send to them is honest , thus they believe whatever they heard . this is like playing game with the people . second , when people face reality , it is when they go to buy an item , then they are realized that what it is offering to them is not what they have shown to them . their reality come true a something of very bad quality and the price ask for such item is awkfaully expensive . people realized that the message wa just an scam in order to get their attention and then go to buy that good . finally , people who use advertisement this way , they are very dishonest with their buyer . so , nowadays we have to be very careful about what company offer u in flayers , newspaper and tv . it is very easy to get someone attention offering the most wonderful and perfect item in the world , but it is what we are getting . overall , people who advertise , they do not regard other people a soon a they will be able to obtain whatever they want . it is their final purpose , regardless the consequence . this is a very popular way to get people . thus , i agree with the above statement .
