in my opinion it is better to have a broader knowledge of many academic subject . in today 's world , no subject can be studied in isolation . subjects are linked to each other . for a good understanding of one subject , some amount of knowledge of a related subject is essential . for example , for studying complex genetic engineering , a knowledge of computer is required for studying model . similarly , while studying history of a particular region at a certain time , it is beneficial to know the economics of that area at that time . it would help u better understand the event occuring at that time and the reason behind them . thus , a subject are inter-related we need to have knowledge of many subject . we also need to understand thing happening around u . things happening around u are also related . to understand issue like why did the iraq war occur , we need to understand politics and history . to be aware of why and when tsunami or hurricane occur , we need to know geography . if we catch cold , then we need to know why it happened and how we can prevent it . so we need to expand our horizon of knowledge to include many subject to increase our awareness . does this mean that we dont need specialist ? specialists are required a there are many area which require a detailed and thorough study which specialist have done . for research in particular field specialist are required . in my opinion , the number of subject to be studied should vary according to the level of education . primary and secondary education should focus on a variety of subject a they are the building block of a student 's knowledge base . higher education can be focussed at a specific subject . thus , a broad knowledge of numerous academic subject is essential at the primary and secondary level of education .
