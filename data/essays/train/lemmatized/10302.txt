as far a concerned , i disagree that in twenty year there will be fewer car than today . maybe it could happen in far future but in twenty year there will be more car that are more developed . there are several reason of my thought . first of all , car are comfortable and fast tranformation . it enables you to get any place that ha ground . when i wa a high-school student i often late in class because there were lot of homework to do and the class started early in the morning . so my mother gave me ride to school so that i would not late in class . next , car are useful to move havey thing better than a person . my parent did not have a car just after our family moved to us from south korea . we had to go shoopping to buy some food and furniture and other thing . we had so many thing to buy but we did n't have any transpormation to get to the mall and bring those all stuff . there wa no other transpormation except individual car to get to the store . so we had to borrow a car from the next door that we never met . it wa really a embarass experience . in my oppinion , there will be car just a it is today .
