some people prefers to have knowledge in many differents subject , which will stay broad . other people prefers to specialize themselve in one specific subject . from my point of view , it is better to start with having a general knowledge in many academic subject , and later on to spezialize in one specific subject . the argument i have for this opinion are stated below . first of all , i definitely believe that , until you are a student , you should follow different class during the whole time you are at school . the reason is that it is extremely important to have a lot of knowledge in general culture and an overview of the many topic you will have the possibility to study in a more detailed way . for example , it is important to have a broad knowledge in biology to first know more about life on earth and second to be able to decide if you want to specify yourself in that domain . otherwise , you might want to specify yourself in biology without even knowing if you like that subject . later on , when you begin to study at the university , i have the opinion that it is a better solution to specialize yourself in one specific subject rather than following many course on different subject . the reason i have this opinion is that regularly , student know which subject they like . therefore , they should specialize in this specific subject . they will get interested while going deep into the detail of this subject . this specialization will have a positive effect after finishing the university . the student who have specialized themselve in a specific subject will surely have good opportunity to find a high-paid job they will enjoy . to conclude , i think that the best solution is to first have a broad and general knowledge in many academic subject to create a good overview in the mind . then it make a lot of sense to specialize yourself in one specific subject you find interesting , to expand your knowledge in that subject while having fun to study it in the same time , and then be able to find a good job in the future .
