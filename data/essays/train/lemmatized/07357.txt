people seldom agree with each other , even on the slightly issue such a if young people enjoy life more than older people do . few people claim that young people are more awared of how to enjoy life than the older people do . however , other people have completely different idea , they believe that older people enjoy life more than younger people , and that is also my point . always , young people could hardly be satisfied . for instance , young girl always not satisfied with their beauty and young boy often think they are not strong enough . they do a lot of work to `` perfect '' them self but in vain . when they are faced problem or decision , they are always hestitaed and could not stop looking for a perfect solution until they are completely tired and feel frustrated . it is unuseful for them to enjoy life . by contrast , older people have experienced some frustration and therefore are more easily satisfied than the young people . older people know that no one could be perfect and we should learn to endure the disadvantage of the others and ourselves . in addition , older people always have a better financial condition than the young people do . young people , for instance , high school student still need parent to support their daily life , it is hard for them to enjoy life without their parent ' financial supporting since they do not earn that much money . for instance , it is hard for young people to go to a foreign country for travaling if older people do not support them to . however , employed older people do not need to worry about the finance resource , they could enjoy themselves anytime they want . in summary , older people are more easily satisfied than the young people do , which make them relax and enjoying life . they also have a better financial condition , which make the range of enjoyment larger .
