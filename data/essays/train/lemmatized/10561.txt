most people agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem better than they really are . through own experience and and earned knowlegde , people learned to differ between reality and the promise of the `` commercial world '' . but still a lot of people get miss lead by the appearence of product in advertisments . i think that small company do n't really what their product to appear better than they are because they ca n't sell their product when they have promised something completely different . for example , the cleaning product doe n't do what it 's promoter promised . once you have bought this product you will never buy it again because it 's wasted money to invest in it . eventually you will tell your friend and they wo n't buy it either . it 's more efficient for the company of a smaller size to invent a product that is reliable and people will buy this particullar product more often . so the company is able to earn more money . in my oppinion the false appearence of product in advertisments is a result of a wrong , overpromotion and often used by big company who sell more than one product . when big grocery store produce commericals , their goal is to attract new costumer . people do n't go to grocery store just to buy a single apple . once they are in the store they buy other thing which increase the profit of the company . i think you ca n't really generalize that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . it depends on the size of the company , their promoting ability , the mony a company ha availible to spend on promotion and the target age group . little kid are more likely to believe what commercial are promising than most of the grown-ups who understand the concept of business .
