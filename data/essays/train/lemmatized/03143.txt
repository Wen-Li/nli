while man is growing he learns a lot of information about how to behave , how to live , how to survive in the society , which is good and which is bad , because all are essential while growing . in this way the education is also very important to a person . beginning from childhood he learnt several thing . by studying different field of subject he can get a variety of knowledge about different topic . like if he study history he know about past historical story , and while learning science he have a knowledge about health and reason for scientifical thing , like that if we study different area then we can get more knowledge related to all field . that is the reason childrens are studying in the school day in different subject . upto high school education it give all the basic principle presented in related subject , while coming to higher education it is differs and confining to le subject because we want to specialize in some particular area which we like most . then if a student is interested in math he take that subject and studying it , and another student interested in the other subject and take that subject a a major subject and acquires proficiency in that area . in my opinion it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject upto graduation level . why because upto that level we get some idea about all basic principle behind in it . a the study go on a like master 's degree than it is better to take a single subject rather than taking several subject . that is the time to be specialize in specific subject . why because by studying all the subject at that time also there is no use , if we become familier with one subject we can find new thing which is very useful to u . finally i agree with the opinion that it is better have broad knowledge on many academic subject upto graduation level which result in good result .
