the human always need to be educated to reach good life standard therefore learning is a very important aspect of humanslife . everyone ha different point of view about the idea of education . some assume that it is more important for student to understnad the idea and concept , in contrary to those some think learning fact are more important . i personally agree with the second idea . these are my following reason ; firstly , learning by fact is permanent . experiments are good example for fact . for example , the one make an experiment on the frog in the lab in order to see the system inside of it body , he wo n't forget what he ha seen for the year later . because it is realistic and live . in addition to this , learning fact make people feel confident . for instance , the one is studying medicine if he study just on the idea of the professor and the concept in latin it will not work , he need extra experience in order to be a good doctor . as he ha experienced the fact , he will gain self confidence because he will have the control on the patience . the last but not least , learning fact are easier than idea and concept . for example , the teacher will tell the student about a historical event , visiting a museum will be more attractive than reading from a book . because when they visit the museum they will see the photo taken and the painting drawn in that year . photos and painting are the most helpful equipment for the fact . the student will not only enjoy the time in museum but also will learn easily . all in all , a i said before learning fact is both permanent and make people feel confident a well a it is easy . the long and the short of it is that , action speaks louder than word .
