in twenty year there probably will be a much better system of alternative way of movement , like the train , in the most industrial country . so people there wont need their car to go to vacation or even to their job . also there will be a big raise of the oil price in the next 20 year and , because of the growing enviromental-pollution , a lot of restriction on car-driving , which mean car-driving will be much more expensive than now , so people will try to minimize car-using . but there are also many reason why the nuber o car will grow up in the next 20 year . first of all , mobility is getting more ond more importent in the buisness-live . the distance between the workling-place and the place you are living will expend , so more people will use a car going to work . second , the number of car in the country of the third world will raise extremly . nation like china or india , where most of the people dont have car by now , will become more wealthy . so the people living in these country will be able to buy car . and remember , the number of people living there is much bigger than the number of people living in the industrial nation . cuncluding , i think the number of car in the industrial country , like the usa oder germany , will decline in the next 20 year . but in the same time , the number of car in the third world countrise will raise much faster . so , all in all , i disagree with the statement in the question . i think , in 20 year there will be more car on the earth than now .
