the advertisement world sometimes is bigger than the cuality of the product . i have to agree with the statement because the world now a day is based on consuming and selling a much a possiible . fisrt everything come first right in to the human eye , what look atractive , new and original is always an eye catcher , and this ha been proved , even i am a victim of those atractive thing , is something comun and usual to find . as example we have coca cola and pepsi , is obvious they compit with each other and sometimes roughly , it is really a war . and here is easy to read a great advertisment campaing second , becouse of the growth of the world and the technological advance poeple are more often expossed to advertisement , and competition ha grown , so the only way of wining is by advertising anything , and a long a it sail is fine for any company who need advertising . is ha been seen in the aspect of beauty , advertisemtn control the world thought and mind , because of the amoo8ount and constant information they send , a an exapmle abercrombie ha this message of sexy and the the sailers are all good looking and grat body . and evidentiially all kind of people wanting this thing go and buy there , is theyr way of sailing . third because the people are been bombarded constantly by propaganda , now is not a competition betwen product is betwen the best advertising . so now the company have to figure out how to catch the eye of at least one person , and sicceed with the porpouse state at the propaganda . but what became a tool , now created a silent war between product and company that are competion . the best advertising win ; but this leaf sometimes a side the cuality of the product , in many occations we can find that you buy something because of the exterior nad it end up been junk or a disaster or just what you were not expecting . as an example i bought a drink nad it looked good , delicious but the taste wa extremely sweet nad gave a head ache . so in conclution even a fantastci advertisment can be junk or not really what they are selling .
