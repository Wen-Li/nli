the use of car ha been rapidly increasing day by day . this is because of it convienience and price which have gone down . most of the middle class class people are also able to get the car because of the price and discount offered by the manufacturer . once car ha been a luxury but now it is a common man vehicle . its become easier way to move around and convienient for many to go . in the coming twenty year the rate of car in usage will be more . i completly disagree with the given state ment . the usage of car when compared with the past time ha increased three time . and when the price are going down there will be increase in number of car usagers and number of car in usage . cars are more convinient to travel and more number of people can be accomodated at a time . when comfort is coming in a lower price and in such inexpensive manner people are going to make use of the comfort . inpresent day it self a medium class man is able to take a car , in the coming year the bike which are used now will be replaced by car . once buying a car wa rich man choice . the price wa high and normal man could not effort to get it . but now it ha reached the common man . in an other twenty year it going to be a need rather . all the bike will get replced by car . so in future there will be a boom for car and there will be increased number of car when compared to present . this might cause some negative effect but people look for convinience and easier way for transportation which is the general tendency of people .
