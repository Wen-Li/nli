the issue at hand is whether to succeed in life is it worthwile to take a risk or continue with routine standardised pattern of doing think . the issue is important because it directly relates to how doe the behavior of human may effect in their being successful . i believe that by trying out new thing and taking risk there are more chance to become sucessful in life rather than doing a routine task or repetitive task at which a person is good at . the reason which make me belive that taking risk is essential for succeeding because by trying out something new we come up with new set of result which can be helpful if we comprehend these result properly . in past people used to belive that earth wa the centre of universe and all body like sun , moon revolve around it . if copernicus would not have thought the idea that it is sun which is stationary then people would have continued to live in ignorance and no major astronomical discovery would have taken place . thus thinking in routine way or doing thing this way present serious obstacle to development of man kind . secondly by doing thing which we already know how to do we are wasting the immense power of human mind and it creativity . suppose if a student is thaught in class to draw line , box after sometime the student will probably would have learned it well so there is no new thing which can be done but if student try to experiment with different pattern , curve and probably using different colour he may come up with a new kind of art form , doing thing like art require people to use creativity and think out of the box rather than routine task . furthermore i feel that by doing some experiment and risk taking behaviour is essential for new scientific discovery . the basic aim of practical session conducted is to prove that the practical result comply with theory . when dunlop wa working in his lab with rubber tyre he mixed some sulphur while heating the rubber which led to invention of vulcanised rubber , although not sure about toughness and property of it he fitted these new tyre in his son bicycle , thus he found out that new quality of rubber wa much better than old rubber and hence he used his idea and thus wa able to esatablish new company with his new invwention . thus his risk taking behavior had truly paid off , had he been doing same routine taks he would have never succeded . thus taking risk and doing experimentation to challenge established theory and rule play a pivotal role in success of human being rather than just doing routine thing . i believe that success will follow those who challenge the established thing rather than those who like to do only same thing and are unidimensional in their appraoch towards life and work .
