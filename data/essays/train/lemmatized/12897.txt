it is debatable whether student concentrate on ther major or learn about a variety of knowledge . some people say that student have to concentrate on their major because it is better easy to find their job . however , i strongly believe that student should have broad knowledge because the knoledge make student well-rounded person . in addition , student meet many different people who help them have more tolerant respectivities . first of all , taking various class make student well-rouded person . in order to success , they also need physical health . taking physical education help student stay in shape . for example , my cousin who wa suffer from obesity in order to be healthy , he took a dance class . as result of it , he could lose his weigh through the class . he could also more concentrated on studying , in the end he could get a sholarship . i think that if he just had focused on his major , he had not had these positive effect . in addtion , student can meet new people with different repectivities . it is very important for them to live the rest of their life . also , in fact , the knowledge give them more opportunity to find job . for example , i taked a discussion class when i wa a freshman in a college . then i could learn about other people 's opinion about the same topic . eventually , this experience helped me to find job . according an article , many big corporation actually want the people who have various knowledge . that ; s because they think the various ability help them in many aspect of business field . in conclusion , a student take various subject , they can develop their ability and find their talent . without any doubt , you should better experience in various field .
