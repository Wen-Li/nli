i agree with the given statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . young people enjoy the life a they experience the new situation coming accross them . but on other side the older people ha experienced almost every situation whether it is difficilt or easy , thrilling or disappointing . for a young person every thing is new and challanging in this world . young people ha anxiety to do some thing different the other like and they are even stonger than a old one , so he can do many thing that a old one can never think off . a old person ha already gone throudh all this situation so there is nothing to do ahead even if he want to do some thing his physical capability does't allow him tomdo that . but where a a young person ha the required time and strength to work harder and harder to succed . for a young person the time is very precious and so ha to use each and every moment accordingly . where a most of the old people will be suffering with any of the physical or mental problem for example visibility problem . young people are healthy and do have lot of anxiety to do some thing different . a young person is in learning stage where he face many difficulty but i thing that the important part of life . he do lot of mistake and he learns from it and he really enjoys it . as the final analysis i conclude saying that young people do enjoy alot when compared to aold people . one of the main reason i belief is that young people have more stength , anxiety and time to enjoy in what ever they do when compared to old people , who would be suffering from illness and many physical problem .
