i partly agree with the statement that `` it is more important for student to under stand idea and concept than to learn fact . '' because student offen read textbook of certain school or collage and in those book we only read the lesson and come to an idea and learn what the concept is , rather than knowing the fact . and coming to a chemical lab in our collage we require fact rather than idea . for example go for a lesson in an english text there we find n number of story and by reading those we come to idea of what happened in the story ratheer than knowing the fact . and coming to the lab we know about the fact that which reaction will come by combining two acid or base . here we requirefact rather than idea . so understanding idea , concept and fact are helpfull to the student according to the subject they are reading . so at perticular time idea and concept play a major role where a fact on the other time . so , by these resons and example i partly agree with the statment that it is more important for student to under stand idea and concept than to learn fact .
