facts are fact , but , idea and concept are different parameter all together . i strongly agree with the statement which is mentioned . ideas and concept are the factor which put our mind in ideal frame because they keep on challenging our mind and thus we feel the sence of urgency to learn something . if at all fact are important than there could not have been the invention of sir albert einstein , then there have been no newton and thus no `` gravity concept '' . its all because of the idea and concept they were able to invent something unusuall . facts are always fact that can not be altered or modified but idea and concept are quite flexible hence can be modified if and whenever required , thus this suit more to the general way of living . ideas are so pivotal to the humanity that without which nothing can be altered and modified , and hence we will remain the same using same set of object and belonging . revolution come only on the account of idea and some way or the other concept is equally linked to the idea . they bring more pragmatic solution to a problem so always in need . if idea and concept does'nt have value than why roberto guizeto when became the ceo of coca colla it became huge hit , it just because of his idea and concept that gave coca colla a grand hit in international market . also if we encounter the debacle of apple computer , it happens only when steve jobs left the post of ceo of the firm , if fact would have been important than they could have been survived even after their departure . moreover , learning is a joint process in which fact have their own importance but they are not only important thing to be learn , at some point idea and concept find greater edge over the fact , hence they are more pivotal in upbringing of the society .
