i definately agree with the statement that it is important to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact for the reason below . first , understanding concept can lead one to more profound information while only learning fact can only be just knowing fact . because just like tree , under the big concept branch grows . this idea applies every subject people study . for example , when learning history , people can possibly say `` hitler caused the world war ii. '' which is true , but in this situation we do not know why hitler did . however if one say hitler caused the world war ii because germans were so overwhelmed with the treaty of versailes and germany wanted to show that they are powerful , it will make more sense , and it will be more easier to understand it a well . second , understanding concept can save large amount of time . for student , using their the time properly is very important . breaking their time wisely can make their life easier and sometimes they even determines their success a well . in my opinion understanding concept instead of learning fact is more productive way of studying . as i mentioned above , understanding concept not only lead to more information but also lead to know the fact faster . once , i had friend who did not spend much time on studing but getting better grade , and who wa so struggling with their study and spent great chunk of time , but did not get a good grade on it . and i realized that their approach to the topic wa different . the smart one wa trying to get the big picture of it while one wa trying to see the small part of it . when drawing a picture , people measure and sketch it first instead of drawing detail . because if not , the whole structure collapse . for those reason , it is very important to see and understand the big concept rather than learning fact .
