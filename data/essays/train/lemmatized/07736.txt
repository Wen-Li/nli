there are lot of people who voice serios doubt about having broad knowledge of many academic subject and who are prepared to argue with specialization in one specific subject . but i would have to say that if i forced with the decision , my choice would probably be for specialization in one specific subject . in our world it is not easy to find a job in competitive job area . there are lot of people who are able to make job in lot of area , however , lot of company prefer proffesional worker to improve their company . in this kind of situation , people must have to develop themselves for one specific subject . if you want to earn lot of money , you must be a specialist in your job . it is impossible to b profecional in lot of job and being profecional your job is not impossible but it is not easy too . lots of people want to have idea about variety of thing . they may be learn thing about lot of thing bu it is not easy to have well knowledge in lot of job . people may be in a conflict in that kind of situation so they must be develop themselves in their own speciality . the technological development have created a new world . with such of that technological movement , there is not any restrinction for development . if you have a broad knowledge in many area it mean that you know about lot of thing but it doe not mean that you are well about that kind of thing . for example , endustrial engineer have lot of knowledge about computer and electronic however many company prefer to computer and electronic engineer in their job . all in all , from what ha been discussed above we can safely draw the conclusion that people should specialize in one specific subject . becouse of the situation such a competitive job area , importance of well knowledge and impossibilty of the broad knowledge of many area , we should have to develop u in one specific subject profecionally .
