i think that is more important for a student to learn the idea instead of learn the fact . there are an enourmos number of fact . all these fact ca n't be learnt by a student because if it were true a student spent all his life only for learnt something that not always is usefull for him . the idea are very important and they help you not only to understand how something occur but they help you to understand why something occur . for u is more important know how or why something occur ? in my opinion i think that know why is the best . the idea are at the base of any event and they can be applied to all other fact that we do n't know . if we know the idea on which a phenomenom is based we can also understand other phenomenon that we have n't ever been studied . for example in the engeniering branch i studied the fondamental idea that explain many phenomenon like the move of a motor or the way like the current arrived into every house but these idea are very important for many others course like the safety in the home or the electric field cause by the high voltage line . if idid n't understand very well these idea i must learnt all the other topic and maybe i must take some of those in memory because i do n't know the basic idea . finally i prefer idea because are le difficult than the whole concept . the concept can be recognize step by step starting from the idea and making some logical passeges that bring u to the correct conclusion that explain very well the fact .
