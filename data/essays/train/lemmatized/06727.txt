basically i do not agree with this statement . actually , travel with a tour guide are confortable . the reason comprises the following two fact . first , most of tour guide usually know and provide a lot of useful information , such a good place for visiting and viewing , delicious restaurant and dengeours area . the other reason is that we do not have to care any problem related to speaking foreign language e.g. reserving hotel , buying ticket or ordering in restaulants . however , guide tour have a serious problem , at least for me : we can not arrange the schedule a we like . tour course are strictly determined . this implies that we can not take a rest even if we feel very tired , and we have to go to place where we do not want to go . we can not get up late . .. another reason why i do not agree with the statement is that we are not able to have private time due to the group travel . private time is quite a precious for eny situation , especially for travel . we must always go with the group and the tour guide . on the other hand for the private travel , we can go anywhere we want to go , we can have a tea for a rest , we can stay for a long time a we like . if we want to know some useful information , travel information center will be helpful . we may apply half-day or one-day tour found in the information center . in summary , i prefer private travel . if i need some useful information or some optional tour , i will go to travel information center .
