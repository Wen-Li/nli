life is unique and is all what we have . there are different kind of people experiencing different stage of life . obviously the two major kind of people are the younger and the older . what everyone wish to do is to enjoy their life and i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life when compared to the old . first , younger people have very le responsibilties in their life when you compare to that of a older guy . a old man usually keep thinking about his family and his responsibility . he got to sacrifice many of his pleasure for the sake of his duty . on the other hand most of the young guy main aim would be to enjoy the life whether it college or job a they got someone who care for them . second , not all thing are possible for a older guy a he doesnot have the energy or capability . energy is innate in an younger one . considering an example in which both the younger and older go on an expedition probably a mountain . the later could not do it alone a he doe not have the potence in him . although he might have a good knowledge about the place , he is not physically suitable . finally there scope of enjoyment for the older is narrowed . the narrowing is due to society and physical capability . normally a oldman can not go around adventorous trip or play different kind of game especially outdoors . society brings a lot of change in the older people especiallty their thought , their character and their behaviour . for example , he can not flirt around with a girl a he had a wife , he can not go on a risky job a he got many people dependent on him . coming to the younger people the scope is a broad a their imagination . they can enjoy thier life in the way they wish to . i hereby conclude confidently that young people do enjoy life mre than the older people do .
