last week while i wa driving to gallarate , a town near the university i attend , i met my granmother , so i stopped and asked her were she wa going . surprisingly she said that she wa going to an elderly house in order to help the volunteer that worked there . i have to admit that i strongly felt guilty > i wa going to a shopping mall to do some shopping ! thus , you can understand that i surely agree with this statement . personally i think that nowadays young people * like me ( don-t spend enought time helping thier community . there are many reason for this behavior . first i-m afraid that young people aren-t surely a generous a they ancestor . they are much more committed to thier own interest and necessity so they don-t see the needings of other people . what-s more they are not used to living away from their family and grandparent so they don-t understand how important is for elderly people to spend some time with the youngest , just listening to their problem and love story . furthermore they usually stay at university campus all the day/long , they don-t go off until the evening so they don-t even know what the problem of the community off the campus can be or where they can work a volunteer . this fact must not be entirely seen a a lack of young people . the work that must be done to receive high grade is very hard . students don-t have only to attend the lesson , but they must review the note taken in class , meet other student in order to compare these note , do group research in the laboratory . .. thus , very short time remaind for them and during these free time they probably want to enjoy theirselves . so , even if it is true that young people don-t spend enought time helping their community , in my point of view it is not completely they fault . thus , you can understand why last week i actually went to the shopping mall . but you can also understand why i phoned my granmother later and asked her if she need some help at the elderly house .
