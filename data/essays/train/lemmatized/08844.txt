i agree that successful people try new thing and take their neck out even if they do know it is possible for them to fail their life and spend money on nothing . i also know there are many people who failed in trying new challenge , but i am sure that without challenging new thing there will be no great success . in korea , there are world-wide company called `` samsung electronics '' . even if you do not know about it name , you can easily check the logo of the company on almost every cell phone in united states . the company have been writing a new record of net profit evey year from this cell phone market . however , just 10 year ago , the company wa one of the company which produce appliance . when the owner decided to avert to a new market in cell phone , most of the employee disagreed with his idea because it is too risky . but without his adventurous idea , they could not progress to the big company right now . also , if people looked at the full moon and thought how beautiful and bright it wa , could we imagine the people 's step on the moon ? could we imagine the successful story of artificial satellite using for broadcasting and wireless communication now if people were satisfied with letter and bell 's phone system ? i believe somebody 's idea which seemed to be odd or crazy at the moment can make people 's successful story let alone their success will help other 's life more efficiently .
