i disagree with this statement because ( but i hope it will be true ) there are a huge number of interest linked with the car industry and it will be improbably that in only twenty year something will be change . first of all , i do n't think that in a small time the tecnology devolp new kind on movement system and , more important that they will be secure for the human ( like what happen in germany with a new kind of train that wa based on the magnetic force , a disaster , many people dead ) , we must be sure ! . second , in my opinion , the owner of oil production had invest a lot of money in industry that produce car , so if these industry change their standard of production , probably , a lot of them would close and a lot of people will be unemployement . also if the oil will end , i am sure that all these rich people will find something else to mantain their control on the transport organization . however the mainly reason , that make impossible the statement is the absence of high investiment in sector like scientific-transport research . altought the governement continue to say that something is going to change , i do n't trust with this sentence , for me is only a way to make people sure . maybe in twenty year will be more car than now , and probably , but i hope that something will change for real , the ambiental situation will be more dangerous than now . in conclusion the huge interest , the absence of serious investiments and the le attention that people do on this problem , make not possible what the statement say . i think that a solution for what i have exposed is : the governement of the most rich country ( where car are in large number ) would invest in industry that want realize car without the use of oil and more important , there will be industry that take an hard decision : produce in a different way .
