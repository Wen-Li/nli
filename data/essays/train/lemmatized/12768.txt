life is just a short jurney in every person 's life . it 's a small stop before our long lasting life . so people should enjoy every moment of it . i always believed that old people have more experience than young people because they have spent more time in this life . as a result from their experience in life they learned that each individual should enjoy his/her life before death . thats why they enjoy their life more than young people . i believe that old people learned that they have to enjoy their life in the hard way after spending half of their life worrying and thinking about what will happen to them later in the future . enjoying life need people who do n't think too much about what will happen next , people who think that everything is written in their book of life and people who believe in something called disteny . all of these three thing are mostly present in old people . as a person who is full of faith i believe that everything we 're doing in our life is written and decided by god before we were born . thats why i always listen to my grandparent when they advice me to enjoy my life . life come once only , this is something that not most young people keep in mind . they always work hard and worry over thing that wo n't help them enjoy their life . old people believe that if they enjoy their life they will get a healthier and a longer life . which is something reasonable . think about it in this way , if you are living in a life that is filled with worriness you will get many disease starting with sleepless night to blood pressure . thats why whenever my parent say '' live your life '' it make sence to me . to conclude , i believe that if each one of u try to sit with our parent , grandparent or even our older friend we will learn and benefit so many thing from them . not to mention our awareness of life and that it 's a short journey that we should always enjoy .
