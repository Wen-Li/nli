marketing success it is not uncommon to hear or read opinion regarding product and how they are not what they were expected to be . this is partially the fault of marketing and their advertisement , since what they do is create a perception of a product that may not be totally true in reality . this is why i agree with the statement presented , `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' . a product can be anything from an idea , to something we consume . marketing 's objective is to increase acceptance of a product by using scheme to create a necessity and convince the end user to obtain that certain service , product , or idea . it get interesting when the `` acceptance '' translates into sale . which will bring important insight to my argument . since acceptance mean buying a product , then advertisement may tend to exaggerate or seduce potential customer to persuade them into buying . since buying brings money to the company , and company love money , more effort is put into adverstisements and marketing to boost sale . so to speak , we are tricked by pro 's into buying . this is probabbly why we are sometimes fooled by advertisments . they are carefully made by expert who know what target market they want to reach , how they want to reach it , and , most importantly , how to convince that market . these expert have studied psychology , learned about human behavior , performed survey , and thus know how to adequately sell a product . this scheme , this advertisement , trigger psychological need that we have and make u buy the product . we sometimes do not need it , but we end up buying it because how well it wa sold . and it is after we assimilate how valuable this product , idea , or sevice really is to our daily life that we then realize how we `` percieved '' a product to be better than what it really is . it is a if we removed a blind fold , or eliminate the drug that fooled u into buying that good . we understand how it is not a real necessity , and so , how that product is not a good a we thought it wa . the purpose of advertisement is to boost sale by convincing customer to buy a product . we may get tougher and smarter , but advertiser will also get tougher and smarter . what we then have to realize is how a product will improve and satisfy personal daily need . this way we will not get fooled into buying something that is not a good a we were tricked into believeing . ..
