when i studied in the high-school my teacher gave a difficult project to do . it wa about computer science . i had to preapare a big program with using c++. she also told me if i could n't preapare this project , i could not pas the class . i wa in depressed . first i thougt to refuse this project but than i said myself that i can do that . finally i did . it wa a big success during my high-school life . although i take a lot of risk for this project . in my opinion , successful people should try new thing and take risk than only doing what they already know how to do well , because it will give them chance to be social in live and improve themselves in a different way . nowadays it is very important to live in a good condition . for this , you have to need qualified job , high education level , car , house . all of this reson we have to lernr how to be in success . for example we ca n't live without money . it is not so easy to make money . in this case success is very important . we have to be social in society to catch the successful way . how it can possible if we do n't take risk and just doing what we already know . i this situation it will be difficult to catch the success . although every celebrity , politician and company take risk to start their success . it is the same for student , if you will be social during the lesson and after lesson in the college and do n't be afraid try to do new thing it will open you successful way in your educational live . in conclusion a i wrote my experience too , it is important to take risk and try new thing to be a successful person . otherwise it will be very difficult to live in this century .
