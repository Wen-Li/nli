i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . they want to live life fully to the end and enjoy it . i have good reason to support this idea . first of all , young people have more enthusiasm to try new thing and enjoy them . for example , if you have asked a 20 year old college kid if he want to do rafting , he would go for it . however , if you have asked the same question to a 50 year old man , he would probably say that he is too old to try it . so , this is the first reason why i believe that younger people enjoy life more . secondly , young people are more spontenaous . for example , if a friend have called and asked to go out for dinner in half an hour , a young person would say `` ok , i 'll see you there in half an hour '' , but an older person would stay home with the family because they have responsibility . thus , young person would have fun and enjoy the dinner . also , i believe that a people get older , they become le energetic which keep them away from enjoying life . for example , my grandmother is 75 year old and i can never take her out to do shopping which i enjoy a lot . she find it very exhausting and prefers to stay home by herself . then , she think about my grandfather who passed away 10 year ago and get depressed . this is another reason why older people can not enjoy life a much a young people . finally , the friend have great impact . when you are 20 year old , you would have friend around your age , almost the same maturity . even if you were a boring person , they would push you to enjoy the life and have fun . however , when you get older , you can not have the same realtionship with the friend . in conclusion , i believe that younger people enjoy life more than the older one . i believe that everything is possible and easier to do when you are young . so , we should not postpone anything for later .
