in my opinion it is normal that successful people try new thing and take risk because they see the world in a different way that is quite different than a normal worldwide . for examle . rich people do n't care about money and for this reason the will never be warried about a kind of investment , they have enouth money to live however . for poor people ( middle-class people ) doing investment is a very hard problem because they have a little quantity of money avaleable which is the result of year and year of work . for this reason they will think several time befor doing something new taking risk . i have mentioned this example because i 'm living a self experience about this topic . i 'm studying in milan ( but i 'm original of the south of italy ) and for me this is a great opportunity that my parent are giving to me , and i appreciate a lot the effort they are doing to let me stay here . so befor doing this choise me and my family spend a lot of time to plan togheter ( to convince them to . . ) my future . only at the and , after they have benn considered al risk , they agree with me . this is n't the case of a friend of mine , with a very successful family , which had the opportunity to try new studying experience abroad even if he wa n't plenty convict . he tried because the most he could lose wa `` an year '' spent far away from the family . another radically different type of example could be the following . successful scientist are always pushed to try new theory , to discover new thing because it is an innaturally aspect of their personality
