i totally disagree with the statement ` young people enjoy life more than older people do ' , being in my youth at the age of seventeen i trully feel my level or energy of enjoyment is way greater than that of my uncle and aunt , but this dose n't necessarily mean that people who are older do n't enjoy life . young people have different kind of enjoyment in life , a they have a lot of vigour , passion , aggression to do something or to be someone and to enjoy life simultaneously , whereas older people have vigour , passion and aggression for other thing which do n't show a they have been through all the age , they used to enjoy life differently and now they enjoy life a they have attained most of their goal and dream . i would like to tell you about an example , my dream is to have a house in australia for which i have to work hard , whereas people who have already achieved thing are enjoying their life . there are different type of enjoying life by young people and older people , i would certainly call river raftin , trekking , playing in the snow , watching movie etc. enjoying life to the fullest , whereas my dad and mom would call cruises , going to meuseums , go for classical music concert enjoying life . so there is a generation gap , but this dose n't mean that my parent are enjoying life lesser than i am . its not about how much you enjoy it about how you enjoy life , and that can be same for young people a well a older people . young people have the time to enjoy life , whereas older people have le time to enjoy it , but all of this depends on how much you are willing to sacrifice just to enjoy life . so at the end of the day you are just trying to enjoy life and not measure who actually enjoyed more or enjoyed le .
