in my point of view there will be fewer car than today . the main reason for this is the technological development that make the life easier day by day for today people . we can also take the oil reserve in to consideration for the decrease of the number of the car . the technological development is so great and unpredictible that one can do something which might be only a dream in the past like reaching the information he want just by clicking some button . therefore the development may result in the development in the mass transportation and with the benefit of mass transportation ; like the cost and availablity ; people will be willing to use them instead of using their personal vehicle . in twenty year there may be some kind of train which can go faster and cheaper than those of today ' or the mankind will invent a machine which can transport the people to another place in second just like we watch in the scince fiction movie like ` battle star galactica ' or ' star war ' . there is another reason for why there will be fewer car on the road that it is the lack of oil reserve in the world . when you think that the 99 percent of the vehicle use oil for the energy they need this might sound more predictible unless the man kind find another source of energy like sun or a kind of an element which can be used instead of oil . it doe not make much sense to say this because the scientist spends more time to find any other mean of transportation than finding usefull element or source of energy to do the work which the oil doe today . hence the activity of the scientist have focused on new invention and new way of making the life easier and comfortable . to sum it up ; in twenty year will there be fewer car or any kind of vehicle in our world since the today 's activity of scientist show that the mankind is in search for an efficient way of transportation .
