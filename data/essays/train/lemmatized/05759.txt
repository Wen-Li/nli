i personally do n't agree that we have fewer car in use than tuday in twenty year . my reason are a follows . first , i can stete about population in future , especially in developing country . the population have growed up greatly and their standard of living have been becoming higher little by little . furthermore , most of them strongly want to get their own car . actually when last month i visited east africa , kenya and uganda this summer , i wa so surprised that more and more people become to have car and even if they ca n't buy now they strongly want their car . how can they resist their hope of car to do their business and enjoy driving and traveling otherwise their car proveid ? second , price of car will decrease more and more because many company have been providing a large number of car and we have many used car and export them from developed country to developing country . so people will able to buy a new and used car more easily . therefore , a i mentioned above , i difinitedly think that we will have more car in twenty year a near future .
