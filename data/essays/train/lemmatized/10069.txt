advertisemnets are generally used to market different kind of product to consumer . i would agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . this is because each and every company try to advertise their product a superior when compared to that of the competitor . in trying to do this the company will make their product seem much better than they really are to increase the sale of their product . advertisements are meant to be informative but there are some company which advertise their product with little or no information . i think that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are because they are made attractive by using different color . also advertisement use woman to create a sex appeal . in most of the case the advertisement doe n't reveal all the inofrmation about the product a they last for few minute . so only with the information the people obtain from the few minute they decide to try the product and will get dissapointed when they do n't like it . in case of pharmaceutical advertising fda did not regulate the advertising of over the counter medication so at that time people checked the advertisement on telivision and they started using the medication by themselves without the advice from the physician . this harmed many people so fda statred regulating pharmaceutical advertising and asked pharmaceutical company to disclose the side effect , use , contraindication and adverse effect of the drug . for instance after seeing an advertisement of a new stereo system i felt i would find all the feature required by me in that product . but after i bought i realised that it wa not a good a i expected it to be . i really had problem for long time and i could not find some feature listed in the advertisement . in conclusion i would like to suggest the advertising production to make an advertisement more realistic , relevant and informative .
