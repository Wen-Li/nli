most of u , at least once in our life , were dissapointed by a brand-new product we had just bought after being seduced by a flashy advertisement . after learning the bitter truth that the product is not the least of what is presented in it advertisement , we understand that we were swindled by an advertisement . i agree with the fact that most of the time advertisement make the product seem much better than they actually are . the very simple and powerful trait of an advertisement is that the very reason of it existence is to make the product seem more appealing and attractive to the customer . the advertiser primarily aim to show the best property of their product while hiding it weakness behind the curtain . for instance , while watching an advertisement about a video game to be released in the market , it is highly unlikely that you will hear anything about the possible danger of the game such a provoking violence , especially on the target audience . in the advertisement , you will only see the beauty and improvement of this video game compared to prior one , such a it graphical superiority , or development in it scenario etc . .. secondly , an advertisement will always try to impress the customer at first sight . the idea here is to create an illusion in the mind of the customer to convince him to purchase the product . i remember a very notable example for this . when i wa 10 year old , i desperately wanted to have a bicycle since most of my friend possessed one . i remember very clearly that when i saw an ostentatious advertisement about a mountain bike , i fell for it . i repeated a million time to my father that i craved for that bicycle . after seeing the bicycle i remember my father being doubtful about purchasing it because it simply wa n't the bicycle that we saw in the advertisement ! without giving a second thought i went furious . and eventually my father bought that bicycle . using it for several month , when my passion faded away , i realized my mistake , but it wa too late . last but not the least , the advertisement try to catch the customer by aiming to the subconscious . the advertiser study the mind of the customer , namely their target audience , to make them surrender to the idea that the product is absolutely necessary in their life . they achieve this by using certain gesture , word or display in advertisement to catch the customer without awakening his conscience . for example , an advertisement about a car might include a beautiful lady to imply that purchasing the car will also provide the charisma or respect required to impress the lady . the target audience here which consists of mainly male , will be impressed by the car without really acknowledging this trick . all in all , there are several way for the vendor to make their product seem much better than they actually are . eventhough , this statement should not mean that all the product with impressive advertisement are exaggerated in their display , it is definitely true for most of the product because advertising simply mean to make it seem attractive .
