i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older peaple do . of course , it really depends on the person , but i dare not to say the life is better when we are young than after aging . first of all , young people are still working on looking for their purpose in their life . they sometimes struggle , confuse , and are treamendously sensitive ; it may be very hard time to live . however , by getting older , the memory of their adressence will be good . this mean older peaple have richer experience in the life than younger people have . second , generally young people do not have much money . older people may be confident about that they can afford something by themselves . after becoming adressence , continuing to depend on one 's parent is going to be very painful . last and most important , older people know the quality of life . they are mature to live , and able to find joy in the life . comparing older people , young people may be soft and flexible . on the one hand , that is very worth , but on the other hand , it is not stable . the sense of value of the youth is still shaping to be mature . thus i think older people can enjoy their life a well a young people do although they lave already lost their youth . moreover , believing the life after getting older is nice , it is very important to make our life happy .
