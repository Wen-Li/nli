young people nowadays do not give anough time to helping their community . i agree with this statement in all totality . the scenario is reflected in the world today . how many people do you see picking up litter ? how many people do you see helping the proverbial old lady across the street ? a community comprises of like-minded people constantly interacting with each other . it need caring , grooming and regular maintainence which can only be achieved by devoting time to it . young people have to divert time to step out and help their community . in today 's competitive world , everybody watch his own . in the race to success , people have become too busy digging for gold in their own backyard than stepping out and helping a neighbour mow his lawn , or maybe participate in a neighbourhood charity . in a study , it turn out that the number of student appearing for government position are steadily decreasing . this is a striking contrast to the yester-years when young people were proud joining the social service for the betterment of their community . a community is a powerhouse of moral value and improvement of quality of life . a considerable amount of time ha to be invested in it to provide fruitfull result . young people have to nurture the community and make it a better place for child and future member . young people have to realize that their community is analogous to their family . just a spending time with family improves the quality of life at home , similarly spending time in your community improves the quality of life outside . a place where we watch each other 's back and help out in time of need is the place we have to strive for . there will be no transition when we step out of our door and only young people can make it happen .
