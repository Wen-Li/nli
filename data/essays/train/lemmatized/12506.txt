in twenty year the number of car will be even larger than the number of car that we have nowadays . there are many reason to think this , the most obvious one is that technology wont be able to create a substitute for the car in only twenty year . there are other reason that are more human , like dependency . in twenty year car will not be a bad for the enviroment a they are today but the number of car will increase noticeably . in the last century technology ha changed our way of living , one of the most important invention wa the car . who can imagine what would happen if suddenly all the car in the world disappear ? it woul be a caos , the level of dependency that we have on car is very high , we need them . cities are built in a way that life without a car is like hell , almost impossible . distances are longer and road are made for them . but the main reason is on technology , car are now starting to use electricity a their source power ( even tough they use gas too ) but this improvement doe n't help to the problem of the number of car . because there will be car that do not use gasoline but they will still be car . the united states is the model for the world and city there are really wide , car are really needed , american family have a minimun of two car . so a the world get `` americanized '' more car will be used . we also have to note the human incapacity to find an alternative . there are alternative but none of them is perfect . we can use bus or train but in order to use a train or bus you have to go to the station and it will not leave you at the exact point where you want to go . some people can say that riding a bike is the solution , but let 's be real , are people going to ride a bike when they can go five time faster using a car ? without getting tired !!! bikes are the ideal solution but our human condition make u lazy and consequently the bicicle option disapears . maybe in the future the car will fly , that would solve a lot of problem , but it is not something that will happen in the near future . in conclusion , we will have to wait more than twenty year to see the number of car decrease , and a radical change on our society or technology ha to happen in order to this to occur .
