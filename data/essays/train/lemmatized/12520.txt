sucessful people are innovator and risk taker that ha been proved many time in the world history . in any field or area , there are so many example of great achiever who successed just by trying new thing and taking more risk in comparision with common man . i agree with the statement that people who attains goal , achieve sucess do try new and different thing and in that way they take more risk . if a person want to be sucessful then he ha to try a new thing simply because if he continues to do what he is doing well then he must be a sucess which he is not . so to get what he want he ha to try a new way or process . if we consider a business and economy then microsoft , gillette , ford and many more are the product which have caused revolution when they were introduced but initially they were the risk taken by their owner . today they are big sucess story in the world business . in science if a professor or scientist want to invent something then he ha to try few thing and use new method , in a way they all are risk . if they keep doing what they were doing before will they get success , surely the answer is negative . there are many disadvantage of trying new thing which includes lack of information and knowledge , economic risk and the risk of failure . it is very safe to do what we are doing best and we already know how to do it . there is a saying that contented people can never gain success a they are satisfied with what they are doing . the thing which a person is doing well that wa also new when he first started . at the initial stage of the process he wa not knowing that he would be doing exceptional in it . but he tried that new thing and now he is doing very well . so one thing is for sure to do well at one thing the new risk ha to be taken . for a lot of people , to take a risk is not considered a good thing and i believe that is the main reason that we do n't find too many successful people . we forget that when we started walking , when we learnt driving , all were new thing at that time . there wa a risk involved also . if we would bot have done that what would have happened . so to get somthing we have to take a risk and we have to try new thing .
