i do not agree with this statement because i think it is impossible for u to live without car . if it said there will be fewer car in use than there are in fifty year , i think i might agree , though . first reason i disagree with this is that in america , people can not go anywhere without using car because they do not have good transportation system a we do . also , i do not think they can improve transportation system such a train because america ha too large continent so that it will not be easy to make railway all over the continent . i think this can say in many country . next , car are really useful in our life . when sombody in your family get sick in the late night , you can drive to the hospital by yourself and it is much more comfortable for sick people to move by car . if there will be fewer car in use in the future , what will help our emergency trip ? a robot ? i do not think there will be new instrument invented in next two decade . this is because it is hard to actually invent new thing than to just imagine it . and even the gasoline will not be able to use in next twenty year , i think there will be new car moving by some new energy rather than gasoline . moreover , even people are caring about the environmental issue which say that the gas from the car is harming the emvironment , there are so many car which doe not spew harmful gas . although it is hard to invent new thing , it is much easier to improve old one . so i believe that we will not have to worry about emvironmental problem about car . above all , i do not agree with the statement which saying that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year .
