i disagree that it is more important for student to understand idea and convepts than it is for them to learn fact . fist , only student have learn fact , then they will understand idea and convepts . students have learn fact by themselves that they would have a deep expression of what they have done . if we just let the student understand idea and concept , they might not really learn fact . to let the student understand idea and concept is a requirment , but to let the studnets learn fact are more important . second , how doe student to undetstand idea and concept are not better than learn fact ? for instance , we read a novel story , we know what it talk about , but sometimes we might mistakenly know what we have learn about . on the other hand , if you have learn fact . then it is more easier for you to understand idea and concept more clearly . for stundets ' studing , the main point is to learn fact no matter what kind of subject . it is proved that it always ture . so if you what to learn fast ? learn fact ! it will help you a lot . last , a what we know , learning fact are more difficult for student to understand idea and concept . for most of student , they always did the idea and convepts fist , then go on to research fact , at the end of it , it will spend lot of their time on it , and it did not deserve it .
