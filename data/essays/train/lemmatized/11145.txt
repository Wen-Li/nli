do i think that in the next twenty year there will be fewer car in use than nowadays ? it will be marvellous , but it will not be happened . there are several reason that substain my thought . a ) past year ' trend . in the period 1980 - 2000 , the number of car bought in the industrialized country ha increased . every year new model are sold , car are cheaper than in the past , new tecnologies are built inside ( airbags , abs , an so on ) . new law have be iussed by goverments requiring more specific characteristic . all these reason have increased the number of new car b ) new country are becoming industrialized and rich ( see china , india ) . those country have million of habitans that in the future will require the use of new car . do you immagine what doe it mean a new car for each chinese ? how many car will be sold ? what kind of business will be ? c ) oil energy is not considered to be finishing . in the past year the issue of oil reserve wa considered a world 's great problem . but now , new drilling tecnologies have been discovered , more reserve have be found , so at the moment this issue is not considered imminent . d ) people have to move faster than in the past . very often , peole find a job far form their own house . for that reason they have to use train , bus , plane and car every day . how will they be able to get to work without their own car ? it 's a great deal , how can be solved if we would want to reduce the number of car ? on the other hand , if the number of car will increase , enviromental issue will grew up . pollutions is the most important . new form of energy will have to be found to move the new car .
