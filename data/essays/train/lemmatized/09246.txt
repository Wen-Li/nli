there is an argument concerning whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . some people might say that learning one special subject is more effective way of study . however i agree whit this statement . because people can build their carrer and social skill . i will present briefly two reason supporting my idea in this essay . first , people are able to develope career through having various subject . in other word , if someone study only in his area . he/she only know about his field . so his/her skill can be narrow and limited . in my experience , when i wa a university student . my major wa the study of vietnamese . so i could speak and write vietnamese well . but when i graduated from school . it is not necessary . most company needed people who have various skill . so i should study again . at that time i studied broad many subject such a economics , english and so on . finally i could get a good job . therfore having broad knowledge is good for showing people 's ability . second , student can improve their relationship with other people thank to taking many subject . what i mean is that when student have various class . the they can meet different kind of people . so it give a good chance to build their social skill . for example , one of my friend take a lot of course in his college . so have many kind of friend . when he ha a problem . they try to help him . and he can be a very sociable person . that is good in his job . consequentry , through having various knowledge , people can make good relationship with other people . in conclusion , i completly agree with the statement that having various knowledge is good way of study . because of the reason that i mentioned above .
