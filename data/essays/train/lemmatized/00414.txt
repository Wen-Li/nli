in my oppinion i agree with the idea of understand the idea and concept than learn the fact and this is because in order for a student to apply what he ha seen in class to real work , is better to understand the concept and idea so he can convert to the best for the work . some of the reason , first if a student can understand and idea he will be able to apply what he just notice ( learned ) in another way or situation , like when a `` painting student '' just learned that the color could be mixed to form some others new color , and the profesor explained so well which type of tone can be mixed with others , and he will experiment all what he understand of this class . but in the other hand , if the student had learn the fact that color could be mixed , like red with blue give the result of purple , we identify that the person will have the idea and absollutly the knowlegde of every color , but he did n't understand the real meaning of the objective of the class . the second reason is since every person can transform the informacion in diferent way and for some people can be easy to understand new subject in the class , like the `` history of mexico '' all the concept , what happened in the past , but definitly that understand it , get the main idea with their own word , will be able to remember it in the future year . and on the contrast a person who learned the `` history '' , is not a very good resource for teaching some other classmate , because is closed to explaind with their own word what they learn , a an example its me , i can not remember the history complete , due a memorizing moment in order to learn by that time . so , basically it is important in any school to encourage the student to understand very good the main point of every lesson learned , so the will be able to apply this in a future with their own understanding of the concept the teacher wanted to explain .
