i agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car for many reason . the reason are : the life status would be more expensive , the overcrowding population and the development of new transportation . the first reason is that the life status would be very expensive . as we know when we move on with time life becomes much more expensive . the price of gas would be higher . in many county the price these day are unbelievable . in the next twenty year le people would use car . they would be aware from the high expense . the second reason is the overcrowding population . in the future there will be more people . due to this overcrowding , people wont be able to transportate from one place to another easly . less people would have car and le people would drive because of this over crowding . along with overcrowding . the people will develop and agressive style of driving , it result to that fewer people would use their car . the third reason is the development of new transportation . scientists are trying to find new method for transportation . probably in the next twenty year there will be highly advanced transportation that would make people le interested in car and it would let them get to their destenations faster than car . there for , due to the reason i have explaned . people would be le intrested in using car . the expensive life status , overcrowding population and the development of new transportation would make people try to find other way to transportate .
