nowadays , it appears that young people do not give enough time helping their community . i agree with this statement . as a teenager , i have witnessed these fact . for instance , young people are more preoccupied by leisure time than anything else . when they come back from school , their main wish is to let off steam , to rest or eventually have fun . parents do not necessarily force them to help their community , so it just doe not come to their attention that their help might be needed . instead , they had rather watch television , go shopping or gather in group of friend to just hang around . young people do not realize that even the smallest action can be of great help . for example , helping nurse to make inventory , caring for old person staying in hospital or even babysitting can be of genuine help . i believe that they are not conscious of their inner selfishness . the problem is , their parent probably never pointed it to them . so who is the one to blaim ? true , most teenager would consciously refuse to give up their plan to go help people in a hospital , but on the other hand if their parent forced them to do so once or twice , they might become aware of the need for their help . sometimes forcing somebody to do something he doe not like can have positive outcome . personally speaking , this is how i realized i wa becoming a selfish person . one day my parent told me to do something useful instead of sitting on a sofa and watch television . since i am a rather good student , i figured i would spend most of my leisure time helping others who had difficulty . i have been doing this for about two monthes now , and i truly do not regret it . in addition to putting an end to my selfishness , it also taught me how to be patient and caring with people . most of my `` student '' have now become friend . so , to sum up , being forced to do something for your own good is useful , and i strongly advise people to do so .
