the question of this essay asks for an opinion of whether or not the number of car will be decreased in twenty year . many people have been using car for the last several year and car are still in use today . my opinion is that although this is true , people will not be using car a much a they use them today in twenty year . to begin with , one reason that i think there wo n't be many car used in the future is the connection to environmental problem . the air have been already polluted because of so many car that have been used , among other pollution problem such a smoke coming from factory . the polluted air could eventually lead to global warming in the next twenty year . scientists are aware nowdays that the tide of the ocean is rising every year . if people were to use more car in the near future , this will probably cause an effect on global warming . scientists will probably try to convince the government to inform nation to decrease their use of car . another reason that i think there will be fewer car in the future is that people are already risking their health by using car more often that instead of using train or bus for transportation . every year , country , especially in the united states , are suffering from car accident . although adult have been have been suffering from drunk driving , ( when they drive their car when their drunk ) , teenager have also been having the same problem . the united states especially had been having hundred of teenager dying from car accident when they were drunk . although the rate of driving car while drunk are beginning to decline , hopefully the goverment of the us and of other country will ban the law of drinking and driving . in conclusion , i believe that the use of car will probably decrease in twenty year because the goverment will try to establish law due to pollution , health and accident risk . hopefully the world will improve to be a better place by using le car .
