in my opinion , i strongly believed that in a close future there will be more car in use than nowadays . i support this statement because of all the think that i see each day of my life . to begin , the population of the world is increasing each day . this situation is concentrated in africa and asia . the prevision for the future population in these county are that it is going to growth and it is not going to stop . i have also notice that the number of car sold in these country are increasing very fat and the number of person for each car is decreasing . that mean that in a few year they are going to approuch and reach the us and europe statistic about the number of slof car per inhabitant . another reason why i thing there will be more car in the future is that the car are becoming le and le expensive due to the competiveness of the car market and of the new technology that allows car constructor to produce at a lower price than ever . so , it is much more easier to have a car now that 5 year ago . i think that this situation is not going to change and i am sure that this situation is going to be implemented . furthermore , the proportion of people who life in the big city is increasing not only in asia and africa but also in europe and the us and the percentage of people for each car in the city is much bigger than in the countryside . so it will cause and increasing of car in use . to conclude , the increasing in the population of the world and the proportion of people who life in the cite , the amelioration of the technology and the are three reason why i disagree with the statement that say that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
