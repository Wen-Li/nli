when we are young we are more energitic , more powerfull , more encouraging and also more willing to do new thing in every part of life . so i think yes young people enjoy life more than older people do . people who are older cant enjoy that much how much younger people can . younger people can go for trip like rock climbing , rappling and all which old people cant . because of there heart problem or even they get tired very easily because of there age . normally old people dont go to collage for study and all where young people have most of there fun . they can new friend , go for party with friend , can go for trip and all . which old peolpes cant do because of there health . take an example of new year when every young people go for party and all , then they came late at night and again on other day they go to collage with that energy and again have fun which tell u that life is more enjoyable for the young people . normally each and every young people like to drive bike and car very fast , they know that it very dangerous and even i know that they enjoy that also . which after an particular age they cant enjoy . even you can see in live world that every rock star , actor and good dancer are normally young . there can be old also but mostly they are young . even all cricketer or athlics are young who can enjoy sport in that particular age limit . this all tell u that more or le young people enjoy more then old one . so from all the point above we can note that young enjoy very much more than old people but every old go once from young .
