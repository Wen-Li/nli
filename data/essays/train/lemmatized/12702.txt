i am totally agree with this statement . i am agree with , firstly because i am a forensic scientist , and so during my formation , we had to learn thing of all academic branch . for example physic , biology , chemistry , law , etc . but more seriously , it 's really important to have a good instruction , it permit you to express yourself about a lot of conversation and so to speak with a lot of people from various speciallities . it is not only usefull for public relation , you can use it when you watch tv or read the newspaper , too . sometimes it 's already really difficult for me to understand what they are talking about on the news on tv . one other thing is that today , with all the medium we have , it become really easy to learn about a lot of academic fileds , not really deaply , it 's sure , but sufficiently to understand how the world is going . i can understand people who wo n't open their mind to other field . i am of these kind when you are talking about business or politics . in fact we ca n't be interested in everything , but we can interest ourself in so a lot of thing that it would be a shame to not profite of this opportunity . just to put a tragic accent at this essay , we can say that the lack of knowledge is what a conduct to all the extrem nation our world ha known a the fascismus or the really hard communism a in ancient sovietic union . in fact , if hitler had learned to know the juves and if the inhabitant of the ancient sovietic union had known what wa going on outside the union , these `` terror `` nation would n't have live so long ! to conclude , the lack of knowledge is nowadays unjustified and it 'll be something bad to not profite of the opportunity we have . it 's about time to open our mind .
