some people say that in their opinion it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i mainly disagree to that opinion . as a child and during the time of education at school to gain a broad knowledge is important . that is because for the life after school a child must find out in what it is interested . this is on the one hand important for the choice of profession and on the other for it own developmet . but later it is a well a important to specialize in a specific subject , because specific knowledge is very worthy . so for example a company is willing to pay a lot of money for employee who have specialized in a subject where only le people are specialized in . that is because their knowledge is rare . another point is that today the sum of academic knowledge is so big , that it is impossible for one person to specialize in every subject . but everzbody feel much better and is much prouder of himself , if he is specialised in a specific subject , than if he know a bit of everything . third people are more interested in some thing than in others . and if somebody is interested in something he will be able to learn more and faster than if he is not . according to that it is more efficient to specialize than to do not . last , based on the second point , there could no more scientific research been carried out if everybody would try to specialize on everything , because everybody would die before he would get to the point where he could start research . so basically you must disagree with that statement .
