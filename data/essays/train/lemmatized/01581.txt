a lot of greek lyrical poet wrote ode to the beauty of youth , and elogiated it a the highest , most rewarding stage in life . when the time came for them to deal with the old age , all their word assumed negative and dark implication , their rhythm slowed down , their optimism faded away , a if the wonderful joy that they had collected during their youth had completely disappeared , leaving no good memory , no sign at all . in my opinion , this is the best feature of the year that i am living : the great sense of expectation that i feel every day . when you are young , everything seems easy to reach , possible . it is a if you are given all the opportunity you want , and you can even dare to refuse some of them , to pick the one you prefer . and then , you are still at school . studying definitely brings along a big amount of new , different and stimulating experience that hit , strike and confuse the student with fantastic , oniric idea of what the world could be . this is the period in which they - we - inhalate the greatest part of image , sound , color and word , our own heritage for the rest of our life . this is the time when our mind are completely open . on a more pragmatical side , youngster ' physical constitution allows them to do more activity than the elder can do . young people can run , dance , play every sport they want without having to worry for their backache or their ostheoporosis . what is more , they can travel , see the world and all the beauty in it . in his novel `` on the road , '' joseph conrad writes that everyone who ha the courage to wake up one day and leave to no definite destination is `` crazy , crazy of life . '' i do not think that there is a better way to say why youth is such an amazing , satisfacting and breath-taking period . maybe , a i said , the most important reason lie in the fact that young people can still dream . and it is when you stop dreaming that your old age begin .
