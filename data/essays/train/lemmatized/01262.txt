education ha been avitally aspect of human life . people are born then firstly want to learn or do something . therfore , learning is the best point in this statement . i do not agree that to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in term of the two most remakable factor are emotion and necessity . the first and most significant factor is emotion . it is true . people need learning something . it is an emotinal action . therfore , emotion is very important for student . for example , a business student want to ask a question about economics so the student just want to learn how about this title . it is the prime factor of learning is important for student . the secondary very important factor is necessity . we have to learn how we can be alive . since the old century , people have researched and they learnt how we can survive . learning is necessary for our life . actually student have to know much knowledge about their major study course . students especially must to learn everything about theit depertmants . i give an example that if a doctor did not know how he/she help a cancer problem , probably the doctor can not be a real doctor . learning is necessity for all student . taking these thing which are emotin and necessity are most important factor about my disagreement . to learn fact can be provide good education for student . consequently , understanding idea is important but learning fact is more important for student . we can see this thing our whole life .
