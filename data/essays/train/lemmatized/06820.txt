surely most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . we have always to remember that behind any advertisement , when we watch tv , when we listen to the radio , or just when we walk in the street , there ha been a deep and accurate research to make the people like that product . it 's not just a matter of what is the product , what is possible to do with it or if it is definitely the best in the market , there is people studying and working to find out how to make it impressive . the advertisement work ! and so , or we believe that the product that we see in tv are really better than the otehrs or we believe that the company want to show it in a better way . sometimes the company create advertisement even nice to watch , trying to create in our mind a nice picture of the product . every day in tv it 's possible to find example , it happened to me to notice that even for product that are proved to be harmful for the health a cigarette or drink , the association is always with something positive , beautiful or cool . why ? for sure because nobody would buy something is not attracted by and because a brilliant image is much more attractive , and this make u think about the positive side of the product . in this way we will go to buy what we have seen even if another product ha the same quality . i could never say : i do n't agree with that statement , it 's so true that probably there would be the need of a stronger regulamentation .
