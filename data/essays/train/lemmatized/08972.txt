there is no direct answer to this question it all depends upon the situation . i do agree witht he statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' but on the other hand i also diagree with this statement . peolpe should try new thing too and take risk but on the other hand they should also try to do thing that they did wrong . not all but most of the successful take risk and try new thing because doing that they get new idea and they come to know different thing and people . this risk taking quality help them to rise from their expectation but also throw them down beyound their expectation . poeple who try doing thing which they already know help them to become professional and perfect in thier field . this help them to stay where they are and doe not help them to rise and if they want to rise they have to risk which are important . there is a famous saying that : `` practice make a man perfect '' so this is suitable for the people who are not risk taker but tryies to do thing what they already know and by doing that they are trying to make themselves perfect . all this is also dependent upon much knowledge a person a about the particular thing or topic and also on person 's luck . for example my father and his friend studied in the same school and they both graduated at the same time from the university . both are successful person in their field my father is lawyer and his friend is an engineer . on day both stood against each other my father wa arisk taker while his friend wa n't . both were fighting for the same contract at the court but due to my father 's luck and ability of taking risk at that time his whole carrer wa at stake but finally he won and his friend who di n't take the risk lose . this tell u that taking risk is not useful all of the time it can lead you to faliure and on the other hand it can also help in the victory of a person like in my father 's case . in the i would say that it all depends upon the situation , your personal experience , knowledge and most important the luck .
