when people travel , some people visit a place with a group of people led by tour guide while others travel by themselves . people who travel in a group might have their reason for doing so . however , i think traveling in a group is bad . fist of all , traveling in a group led by a tour guide doe not usually fit your favor . during the journey to china with my school friend , we were led by a tour guide . from the beggining , there were many discontent between student . all of u wanted to visit super famous market in shanghai but the tour guide did n't let u . he just said that he ca n't let u because it wa not the part of the plan . following the schedule , we just had to see many similar boring temple for three day . also , you can not get to know the place really well if you travel in a group . you wo n't have many chance to enjoy the place . you 'll just have to stay awake following the line . again , when i went to china , i really wanted to have an experience of using chinese . but once when i wa trying to have a talk with chinese , i got reproved from the tour guide for not following him . it made me feel bad not to have spoken chinese even once , though i stayed there for 5 day . some people might argue that trying by yourself can increase the danger of yourself becasue you 're not used to thet place . but this is the thing that i want to point out for the last . as you do n't know the place a lot , you might do more research for the place you are going to visit . eventually , you will get more amusement when you actually arrive at the place . furthermore , you will prepare some solution in case of danger . nobody can be so sure that traveling in a group is safer . rather i think there will be more danger because there is almost no solution in case you get lost from the line . for these three reason , i strongly suggest that traveling in a group led by a tour is bad . i really do want to recommend traveling by yourself or just with your family .
