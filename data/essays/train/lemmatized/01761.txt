no , definitly i do n't agree with this statement . i think in the future it could happen exactly the opposite in the usage of car , and i 'm going to explain why i 'm sure of this . in my opinion , the main reason among a lot of aspect , is the relavant explosion , in these year and also in the next future , of the asiatic population , and , a a direct consequence , of the asiatic market in this sector . in these eastern country , a , for example , china and india , there is a big population that is in costant increasing of their birth , but , what is more important , is growing the level of their social and technological culture and knowledge . it mean that those population , that together have a number of inhabitant which is about thirteen time larger than the one of united states , will create in all economic area , and so also in car sector , a big market that in the next twenty year could only increase the number of material good ( a car , in this case ) which will be exchanged in the global commerce . in this particular example , furthermore , there is another very rilevant aspect which can be affirmed to support my thesis : it is about the relation , in those eastern country , between the population and the territory where thei live . although the number of the inhabitant is so high , the extension of the territory that they occupe is very big , and the need of movement from one side to another of the city it is a real aspect we have to considerate . nowadays this problem is not solved with an important solution , but it is reasonable to think that in the next year , with the increasing of the technological culture and possibility , will be built more road and than car will become the only mean of indipendent trasport and movement .
