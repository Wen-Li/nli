i woke up this morning , earlier than the time i normally would . it wa an important test day for me , and the last thing i would want to do wa to be late for the testing time . i had to leave my house an hour earlier to come to testing place which is normally 15 minute far away , if there 's no traffic ! i live in a big city where 1 out of every 6 people have their own vehicle . it 's not a big city area wise , but the population is over 1 million people . there are public transportation oppurtunities . which cost almost nothing , but people ( for some reason ) prefer their own vehicle . the gas price have been increasing rapidly over the last 5 year . it 's pretty scary when you think about the amount you would have to pay if you were a person to drive to work every single day . if these people were n't a stubborn to use public transportation service ; they would save a lot of money , and would help the traffic calm down . as human being , we do n't really know how to use natural resource . petroleum is one of them . up to now we have n't thought about what we would do if we ran out of it one day . people are finally starting to care about the future , and taking some action to keep what there is . cars also cause lot of environmental damage . they have harmed the ozone layer , and this ha increased the effect of global warming . if we want the generation after u to live in a healthy world , we must start decreasing the number of car we have starting from today . why should a person be wasting money on gas , when they could use public transportation ? it doe n't make sense to have personal vehicle when all they do is cause problem . the number of educated and well aware people is increasing day by day . i believe that these are all indicator that in 20 year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . hopefully i wont be needing to leave the house a early a i do today to get to a place a near !
