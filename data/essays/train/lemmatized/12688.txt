i agree to the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . '' both idea seem great for me but if i have to chose eather one then i will chose broad knowledge of academic subject . through our life we grouw up and learn a lot of different subject . having knowledge about one specific information is seem great but in my pesonaly opinion having a lot of different academic knowldege will bring lot of possibility in , my future . someone who want to be enginier they just need to study math and scient , they are keep doing one job and become specialist . there is a lot of people who want to be a enginier and it is hard to be a one great specialist , and only few peopele can sucess and become specialist . in the other hand , when we know broad information about many acadeic subject then we have a lot of job to do . for example , if i become actrtess and i have knowledge of academic subject then i can etend my job a lot . at fiest , i can sing well then i can be both acrtess and singer . second , if i can speak foreign language then there will be chance to go other country to work . either if i can speak english very well and there will be a chance to come out on the hollywood movie or sing with some famous foreign singer togather to procude cd and sell for both country . third , if i am good at wirithg them i can publish the book or write song . if i have good appearence then i can also be a model . in generally actress come out on comercial , magzine , movie , and some other thing base on own academic knowledge . in my conclusion it is good to have board academic knowledge to extend our job for futuere .
