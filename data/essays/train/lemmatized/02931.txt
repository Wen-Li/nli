i agree that that it is more difficult to assimilate an idea unless there is a good example to support it . in order to make them reachable , idea and concept should be followed by real fact taken from everyday 's life experience . to illustrate with an example , a concept such a ` freedom ' ha a very broad meaning and therefore it may be difficult to categorize and confine it with a few sentence . it should be presented with example from different place around the world , related to people with completely different cultural background . important fact that changed the course of the history should be given . the first major movement that started in the name of freedom is the french revolution . it changed the face of the world in a very positive way . this would be an excellent example to explain the fact that freedom is essential for anyone who want to live his/her life proudly and respectfully . everyone ha a right to make his/her own decision and respect other people 's decision . also , one should have the freedom to express him/herself . there should be a tolerance and respect toward different opinion . scientists , writer who are killed violently because of their opinion should be given a example to illustrate the danger when one overtakes another 's freedom of expression . with freedom come another concept which is ` equality ' . this idea can also be supported by many historical event that took place and still take place . people with different race , religion and culture should be treated equally . there should be no judgement on people ' opinion based purely on which religion or culture they belong to . unfortunately , even today , we see many example of inequality . every day newspaper are full of them , and i think a professor will have no difficulty to show student a few fact illustrating the example of inequality .
