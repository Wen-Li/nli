in twenty year there will be more car than there are today and these car will be bought specially from the teenager for several reason . first of all , nowadays teenager need car more than from twenty year old , because the teenager are going to let their entertaiments be need , for example having mobile wa n't a need for a guy because it wa only for business but nowadays it became a need for everyone and specially for the youth . for that , we can see that with the progress of time , the youth will be asking more and more about need and one of their main need are the car , because car are so important for the teenager and they use them for many usage . for excample they like to go to the college in the car instead of go taxi or in a bus , than at night to go whenever they like without any limit to their wish . second of all , car company are making nowadays small car that have fewer consuming of fuel than the old car , which is better economically and for the air pollution so when the number of car increase , there is no big difference in polluting the air and specially if the car company sucess in saling car that work on hydrogen . so for who is asking about the air pollution we can say that the solution of that issue is found . third of all , in the progress of day , our world is becoming more and more a business world and everyperson wok nowadays . although a person have a work with his study so he need a car for that i do n't agree with the statment . . /
