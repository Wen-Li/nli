a tour guide have a lot of information about travel , but my opinion is if we do n't trip with a tour guide , the trip will be more exciting . there are two reason . for the first , tour guide know very well about where to stay at night , what to eat , what to buy a a survenior and where to visit . on the other hand , group memmbers have limitied information about the area where they are taveling . from this point , it seems better that traveling with ` well informated ' tour guide , but if we travel with guide we depend everthing on the guide . without a tour guide , a group can try any thing . ofcouse sometime the group may wrong choise , but that is more exciting than just do a the guide said . traveling is knowing other food , scene and even air which we ca n't see ordinally life . forethermore , traveling in a group without a tour guide will strength relationship of the group . since the group doe n't have a person who know what to do , such a leader , they have to think each other for their group . every group member must use his brain and discus in the group about where to visit , what to eat and where . this way might take more time but the more the group talk each other , the more thier relationship will be strong . from these two point i prefer traveling without a tour guide to that with him .
