nowadays , people are getting busier and busier with their own bussiness , especially the young people who are fighting hard for their future . as a result , there come the criticism that the young people do not give enough time to helping their community . in my opinion , this statement is groundless and the youngster today do contribute to their community to a great extent . to begin with , we will first look at the community service organised by various school . taking singapore a an example , it is compulsory for each student to accomplish a minumum time of 10 to 30 hour of community service each year , depending on different school and different level of education . the service includes helping out in old folk ' home , organizing charity event and so on . it ha greated contributed to the community considering the size of student population . and not only singapore , school in other country have similiar policy a well to make the student contributed within their ability . secondly , many working young people today are voltunteers in various organizaitions such a hospital and kindergarten . besiding donating their money , they also spend a lot of time in taking care of the patient or child and gain a deeper understanding of their need . in fact , from my experience of being a volunteer , some institution actually depend on these young people a an effective human resource . and each volunteer spends about 3 to 5 hour per week in these voluntary job . lastly , there are many other minor area that the young peole make contribution on . for instance , to help the neighbouring child with their school work is a form of contribution . and everyone may have attended some performces for charity purpose , and that is helping his community too . therefore , i believe that it is unfair to say that the young people do not give enough time to helping their community . the help in various form can be easily seen in every aspect of our life . actually , i think the young people have done a great job in helping out their community .
