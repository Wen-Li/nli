i agree with the statement bacause , according to me , the new technology will allow people to improve the quality of public transport . thanks to this travelling will be faster and will have le impact on the environment . nowadays city are full with car and this is not just an environmental problem but olso an economical one . in my opinion tramcar and alternative mean should be preferred to couch because they need , to be supplied , energy and not with oil . maybe in the future people will use their bicycle to move for short distance and train or plane if they have to cover long distance . but it is only an idea . if the nowadays rate of smog keep growing , a scientist warn , people will realise that we have gone too far an then we will use our car only when we are obliged to do it . to make it feasible the government should give much more money to the transport sector so that people will use public transport a much a possible . this prblem is particularly evident in italy where the public mean of transport are dirty , always late and always full of people : in addiction to that , the ticket is too high if compared to the service provided . so i hope that in twenty time the sector of public transport will be better and that the number of car will be reduced . one of the big issue of these year is that of oil and it price that is growing higher and higher , that is why i prefer walking or take my bicycle to go to the city center . this is a way to see the city from another point of view . in the past fifty year it ha skyrocketed and people can not afford it anymore : so something must change . maybe that of mine is a too optimistic vision but i really hope that the most powerful men in the world will understand the gravity of the situation and react promoving alternative mean in to opposition car .
