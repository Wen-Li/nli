education is understanding a well a learning . in my opinioun it is important for student to learn fact and at the same time also understand idea . it depends upon the situation and experience . understanding idea and concept is important so a to hnow how thing could be . for example , a concept of driving or like traveling faster to a place give u the idea of a car . it tell u to use a car for traveling . but for travelling a car we have to also need to consider the fuel to be used for it , the cost of driving etc . hence the student need to relate their idea with fact needed for it . ideas are more imaginery while fact are practical . but if we dont imagine or think how can we make thing happen ? but to make a practical thing happen we need to learn certain fact that are necessary to realise the idea . for instance , a student think to make a garment . it is firstly important for him to have an idea of what kind of garment doe s/he want to make . s/he must decide the look of the garment like the colour , the lenght , size etc . but this is not over . to make the garment s/he ha to know the fact that this will need a fabric to make it , a pair of scissors to cut it and then to sew the garment . hence a final product can be made . therefore the student do need to understand the idea and concept but at the same time also learn fact to realise thier idea . only understanding and conceptualising idea is not enough for a real thing to be made . a practical knowledge is also required for a student to be successful in his life . hence i think a student should give importance to both , understanding idea and also learning the practicality of life .
