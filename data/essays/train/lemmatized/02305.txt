advertisements have become an important factor in selling product over the last decade . only if a product is advertised a the best there is on the market , customer are going to buy it . at least , that is what advertising company suggest u to believe . but usually the product 's ad in newspaper or on tv look much better than the product actually is . the `` real '' product sometimes doe not have the feature of it medium counterpart . fast food , for example , us great advertising strategy . and if you see an advertised hamburger in the medium , they really look delicate . a lot of lettuce squeeze out between the meat and the bread . however , if the customer then test the actual performance of the fast food restaurant , they will be disppointed . in comparison to the gleaming burger in the ad , a `` real '' burger that is made in a short time without much care doe not fulfill the standard shown in the advertisement . the advertisement of cleaning material also show feature these material are lacking . on homeshopping channel customer can watch experiment in which a cleaning liquid is first used in the car , then in the dirty bathroom and then for the window . the customer are made to believe that one cleaner can be used for everything , and so they might save money when they only buy this universal cleaner , since they do not need other material any longer . these ad are cleverly produced in a tv studio , but customer should think that it is a live-performance they are watching . the advertisment 's producer manipulate the customer , who do not understand the real purpose of the tv performance of the cleaner . as a conclusion it can be stated that advertisement show feature of product that do not exist . unfortunately , there are too many customer that are easy to manipulate , since they do not consider advertisement correctly .
