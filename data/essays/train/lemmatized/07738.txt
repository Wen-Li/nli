i agree with this statement because in the world it is demostrated that people who have obtained success and have important result is what have done different thing in their life and have taken several risk . this is the case of president , scientist , business people and other . i think a successful person is those whose performs differents activity in orde to fulfill a dream and take advantage of new opportunity every day . for example , the mother teresa of calcuta wa a successful person because she did thing that other people of her same congretation never had tried to do . she peformed diverse thing to fulfill her goal in her life and took many risk including her explusion of the catholic church . she understood that if she wanted to help poor people she had to perform any activity that nobody in her church had done before . another example is thomas edison , he tried his experiment 2.000 time and every day he performed the activity he wa convinced were needed . nobody told him how to perform and how many time should his experiment needed to be performed . made what wa planned and he fulfilled his goal of created the lamp . if edison had not decided to do different thing and take the risk of a possible separation of his wife , because she did not like his experiment and the `` waste of time repeating the same thing ' , the humanity would had to wait a long time before have the lamp . this example demostrated that a person can be successful if decide to try new thing and take all the necessary risk in order to fulfill the dream and the goal . in summary the most important this for the success is living in constant change and evolution . human being need to create every day , take advantage of the opprotunies and be aware that every great and important activity includes a risk . a more risk more yield we can expect .
