there are three reason why i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is becuase i believe that student will not be able to learn the fact unless they understand it idea and concept , it is very likely for them to forget the fact if they skip the step to understand idea and concept , and if they have no knowledge on how the fact becomes a fact they will not be able to teach or explain it to other people . firstly , the pupil will not be able to learn the fact completely unless they understand idea or concept since the fact are formed from the concept . i can not imagine myself learning a fact and understanding it perfectly without the knowledge of it background . secondly , the fact that are being learned will not remain in the student ' head just by memorizing them . unless they understand the idea and concept of it , they will soon forget it , for example after the unit test is over . that will definitely not benefit their life in the future and it would mean that the time they spent on learning the fact wa meaningless afterall . lastly , the student who learn the fact without understanding the concept and idea will not be able to teach or explain about the topic to others . i feel that it is a shame for them , and i will be embarrased if i am in a situation where i can not make a thorough explanation when i should know something about it . in conclusion , i agree to the statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn facts. '' because student can not learn fact without understanding idea and concept , the fact will not benefit them without the knowledge of the background , and they will not be able to teach and explain to their peer when they do not have the understanding of idea and concept . i believe that to understand idea and concept is an unneccessary step to be skipped .
