do most advertisement make product seem much better than the really are ? as a source of information i first want to analyse the purpose of advertisement . another good way to find an answer obviously is to examine some example , which will follow . much money is spend on advertisement . the simple purpose is to increase the ammount of sold product . the most simple way to do so would be to show the product in the best light . weaknesses will not find their way in an advertisement . therefore the product should seem very good , which in average will be much better than it really is . let u find out if advertisement take this way of promoting good . one of the most succesfull product of the last year is the ipod , a portable music player . with the succes came a lot of advertisement . the printing campaign simply show the outline of a figure in black with a white ipod . as the photo give a fair impression how the product really look like and there is hardly writte anything on it , we can not pretend that the product seems much better than it really is . take an advertisement of a watch . an important manufactor advertises with a sailing picture . there is only little information about the watch , concluding that it fit perfectly for sailing . again there is not so much written about the product that we could say it wa made better than it is . although there is some advertisement showing a product in the best light , most advertisement seems to work differently . it is not the product , which is sold , it is the brand , the lifestyle , the image . and therefore something invisible is added to the product , which make it seem much different than it really is .
