personally i strongly disagree with the idea that successful people try new thing or are risky people . mistakenly since the beginning of the century , it ha been believed that the reason for success of some people who had started large company were that they had introduced new concept doing something different , and had taken risk . on the other hand , i believe that the reason for success are hard work , motivation and imagination . first i think that hard work usually foster success . for example athlets are clear example . the more and the harder they train , the better result they get . it is clear that athlets that get first position in swimming race are not just risk people . furthermore in academic or labor enviroument , the continuous effort is a valued factor . for instance novel prize are awared for work along several year and not just for one isolated paper or idea . in the second place , imagination ( and not just trying something new ) is crucial for success ( which is reaching a goal ) . some people who we consider successful such a thomas edison , or albet einstain , were people with a huge imagination , and therefore they were able to introduce innovation or new theory . finally , motivation is the main factor for success . even if a person ha the skill , the discipline and imagination , if s/he is not motivated nothing will show up . motivation is the willingness or the reaons for reaching a goal . for example several history acadamics explain that successfull people a athlets , business men , or scientist usually are inspired in a fact a solving a problem , illness , or to honor their parent , etc . consequently agreeing that success in only related to people who are just risky or just try new thing , will only capture a narrow view of source success . success depend on deeper and wider thing that the two thing named in the prompt .
