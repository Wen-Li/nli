nowadays car are useful , because they help people to move from one place to another . there are also other mean of transport , such a train , bus , plane , bycicle , etc . i think that there are pro and contros for such a decision , a to use car instead of others mean . cars are used mostly when you travel within your contry . for longer distance , train or plane are preferred . bycicle , instead , is used for shorter shift . it help somebody to keep fit and it 's good for their health . moreover , car are dangerous for the environment , destroying the atmosphere . some people , in fact , prefer using bus , in order to avoid smog and noise . even if bus is more uncomfortable than car , it is wider and wider used . plenty of people prefer car because they can stay there on by themselves , in order to get not in touch with sombody else . some others , prefer public mean because they are willing to speak with other people . advertising meke you buy carsar a car are concerned , i think that the only opportunity to diminuish them is to invent a new moder technology , in order to replace car . it 's up to the government to invent something to save the environment and , above all , the life of his citizenship . in fact more and more people have a disease , owing to the pollution and it 's difficult to heal . therefore , i guess that if the people know the problem , they will do something to avoid it . the society we belong to change his habit in order to improve the world they live in . to sum it up , i sustain that in twenty year there will be fewer car .
