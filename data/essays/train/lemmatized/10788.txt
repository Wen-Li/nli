progress and development in a general way wa made by hardworking people who specialize themselves in a specific subject . one question could be ask weither it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . in my opinion every one should have a minimum of knowledge in many academic subject but sooner or later we have to choose a specific subject otherwise progress will stop or grow very slowly . for example what would had happened if no one had studied biology specifically ? medecin would n't have evolved and disease and virus would have spread without vacccins or medecins to stop them . we could give similar example for transport that are progressing rapidly since the invention of the wheel people worked very hard to invent new way of transportation ( the bycicle then the car then the plane . .. ) if every one had a broad knowloedge of many academic subject mankind would have very slightly evolved from the stoneage . all the study 's , the research helped the world not only in a scientifical way but even in a economical way , study 's of business have helped the business owner to know how to manage effectively their company 's on a large scale this would help a whole country 's economy and will then help the fight against poverty . it is essential for a healthy world to understand and study specific subject that could help u in oure life but this doe n't mean that the person that is specialised in a subject should be completely ignorant of all exept this specific subject ; like i said before we should all have a minimum of general knowledge of many academic subject but for the sake of progress we should specialize ourselves in a specific subject .
