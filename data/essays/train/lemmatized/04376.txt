i do agree with the fact that it 's more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is to understand fact . i base this agreement basically in personal experience , but also because it ha been proved that it 's the best way of learning thing . that doe n't mean that we have to avoid fact and leave them to concrete moment , sometimes fact are useful in a special ocassion , but it 's common that fact are forgetful than general concept . it 's like building a house . it 's important to have a toilet in the house , or a bed . but if the house ha n't got a solid structure , the bed or the toilet do n't mean anything , because they 're going to be destroyed one way or another . but if the structure is solid , the house will remain in it place and the toilet will be able to be in the place a toilet ha to be . sometimes , it 's going to have problem , like everything and everyone , but it 's going to be there . when a person is learning a new thing , whether if it 's a new concept or a whole new subjetc , it 's necessary for that person to have some clear idea before introducing any more information in his head . the person need a map of the new thing in his brain . the risk will be that if those general idea are not clear , the one that are going to come after are going to be forgotten , because the person doe n't know where to situate them . if the idea are clear , the person is going to asimilate the fact easier and it 's going to be harder for him to forget them . for example , about some month ago i had to learn how to use an editing program called avid . the fist lesson that i took were a chaos , nobody undestood how that program worked out , and when the teacher showed u special feature inside it , we ended the lesson worst than before , because we were able to see a whole mess of a program with no order inside it . in the moment we learned how to use the program , how the different format worked , we were able to use all it special feature . and not only that but now we 're learning another postproduction program , and what took u about two month to learn with the avid , tooked u three lesson with the new one , just because we had in our mind the general idea of how postproductions program work .
