well i think this is a good thaught . now i [ m studyng mktg . and i [ m seeing this thing . if you have a product is very iportant to have a bigest a great brand and advertising , because sometimes you have a product but you go out aand oyou see that some enterprice have the same product and his product is much betta than yours . so you have to have a very good kind of brand an also a great mktg . the thing you should do is createan image to response to the other enterprise and also you have to check a good quality of your product . the most of the time the prodcuct that you have is not the best , but you can make the best if you have a great mktg . lets thing about starbucs example , sttarbucks is not the be coffe shop around the world but they are the number 1 why_ they havesomething that the other do no have asdn this is , mktg . the make a new have to drink coffe and they ar focus to some sector of the econmy . . class ab > > > rich people and medium people now we can see when starbucks ha not the grat coffe but the crate somethingto thepeople that name is needs . also we can see with abercrombie and fitch here in mexico . we can not buy a and f because we do not have a store . only the people can travel outside the country . and if the are a rich people can buy there . so this people came to mexico and they bring this clothe and also if the sell some cloth3e areso expensive . this is why i say that sometimes the mktg is more important to sell one product . .
