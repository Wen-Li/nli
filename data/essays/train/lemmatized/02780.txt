i believe that traveling in a group lead by a tour guide can be very funny , but saying is the best way to travel may not be sure in my point of view . there are other way to travel which can bring more fun and more joy . first of all , i think that traveling with a tour guide can be very good to learn some thing about the place where you are going because the tour guide usually know many thing about the place you visit with them . but , i also think that traveling with them remove you the possibility of discovering thing on yourself and for me that is quite better . secondly , you can also travel alone . this is most for people who like adventure , it is a good way of traveling also because you are going to meet some new people . you will surely more learn of the culture and habit of the place where you are going but for me it can be very sad to travel alone . and finally you can also travel with a group of friend or member of your family which is not led by a tour guide . it can be weird because you are going somewhere with people you might see all the time but i really think you can have more fun and enjoy more your journey , because the people you are moving with are people you know and people who know you . to conclude , i like the idea of traveling alone or in a group led by a tour guide but i really think that me i prefer traveling with people who shared some thing with me before than traveling with people i do n't know .
