i do not agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use that today because people have been having the desire of having their own car to have convieint life and in 20 year , the price of the car will be lower . first , in 20 year , there will be even more car than today . out economy and the state of living conditon have been better and better . these day , people generally do not need to worry about food , place to live and clothes . nowadays , it is the problem of choosing so many option to enhence out life . since we live in a great life , we want to have more comfortable and easy life . there wa an interesting article of driving a car instead of using pubblic transportation . the article say even if people know that the rush hour is painful , they prefer to drive their own car because it is simple to go out and go to the place where they want . second , it will be easier to buy car in the future . the thing that were used to be very expesive so we could not buy well are getting cheaper and cheaper . for instance , buying a computer or a car costed a leg or an arm about 30 and 40 year ago . even buying a computer this year is cheaper than last year . thanks to our technnology , there are a lot of supply than need and people keep looking for a brand new thing which are enhenced more and more . that is why car are also cheaper day by day so a in twenty year , people can get car more easily than now therefore , if people have car , they will use them more than now . like these reason , i disagree that use of car will be fewer than now . some people might think that our pubblic transportation will be more used than indivisual car but still in the big city have longer rush hour and more traffic every year . two reason that i mentioned above support my opinion of use of car in twenty year will not be fewer than today .
