i agree that the young people in nowadays do not give enough time to help their community . there are too many factor which stop young people from helping the community . the young people learn to grasp what they do not at hand and search for what they want to do . these factor leave them solely care about themselves and only deal with their own personal task . first , living with the great pressure to get higer degree end up le and le time for the young people to leave thier leisure time for the community . young people tend to focus on their acdemic field achivement rather than their community . thus , they spend great amount of time studying or explore the acdemic field so that they will get great degree and be qualified to pursue for their future job . second , with the advanced technology in this changing society , young people are more likely to be attracted by medium or other information resource . these leave the young people le time to care about the living area community and prompt to searching for other entertainment . hence , young people will spend more time on theier own leisure time entertainment and try to relax after their daily work . in a word , the rapid changing society prompt the young people to live in the moment to fullfill their dream first . with the growing pressure left for them to compete with others result in le and le time they devote to their community . for the rest of the day left from their goal pursuing mission , they would be more likely to settle down to relax and rest to save some energy for the next busy day . those problem they face in the reality lead them to solve their present situation and cause them only have time to think for themselves rather than others . in the long run , young people get used to their daily task and they become more likely to neglect others thing which may not be necessary for them to deal with .
