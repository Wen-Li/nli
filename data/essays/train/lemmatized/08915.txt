numerous people live together in our society . some people are young , and others are old . sometimes , we can hear that older people say to young prople `` i envy you because you are enjoying your life so much . '' however , i doubt the idea which young people enjoy their life more than older people . as far a i am concerned , they are too busy to enjoy their life because young people have a lot of responsibility to have to do . first , young people have to study for their future . for example , high school student in korea spend over 15 hour to study every day . in my case , i have been studied toefl over 10 hour a day after i decided to go a university abroad . do you think that we seem to enjoy our life ? second , young people have to earn money hardly to support their child . one of my friend hate his job . he is working a engineer , but he actual dream is to be a writer for novel . however , he can not quit the job becuase his son wa just born last year . he doe n't think that he can afford his family doing what he really want . how sad it is ! finally , young people a lot of concern about their future . for example , according a research , 80 % of korean junior high school student answer that they are not happy to the question '' are you happy ? '' because they get ton of stress from study and feel nervous about their future . it is not diffrent for people who work after graduating school . many people are not satisfied with their life and are worried about their future . they are young ; it mean they have a lot of difficulty for the future for them . therefore , i ca n't agree with the idea which young people enjoy their life more than older people . actually , i belive that they could more enjoy they life when they get older after they are done on their responsibility .
