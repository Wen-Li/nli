nowadays , some people argue that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for some people , we are living in a very competitive world and this is a natural concequence . in my opinion , this is done on purpose . first of all , there are lot of type of product on the market and consumer have sometimes difficulty in finding the right one . in these kind of situation advertisement play an important role . people tend to buy the product which they have seen on television commercial or print advertisement . however , when people buy the product , sometimes they see that it is different from the advertisement or it is not a good a the one on television . indeed , company try to show their product better than they are , secondly , there is a great competition between company . some company know that their product are really good and they state it on their advertisement . on the other hand , some company are aware of the quality of their product and they know that they can only compete with the good one if they use advertisement efficiently . in other word , if they do not claim that their product are good on an advertisement people will buy other product . this mean loosing profit for them . furthermore , people tend to buy the product which they see on television . owners of the company know this fact and behave accordingly . they try to use their advertisement to make people learn their product and buy them . besides , they try to influence them by making their product seem much better . in my conclusion , most advertisement make product seem much better than they are and people do it on purpose to sell more product and to gain more profit . i think these are normal result of such a consumer based and competitive market .
