i prefer having a broad knowledge of different academic subject that specilizing in one specific subject . specializing in an specific field is not a weird decition , we can see in our daily life that there is a lot of people that in the last year of degree decide to continue studying in an specific field of knowledge . however , under my own point of view and experience i prefer having a large knowlenge in different subjets , because this is translated into a person who is able to face with different topic in a discussion or debate . first of all , i would like to explain my choice by arguing that in the future i will like to work in a bussiness in which to do a dynamic work . i mean , consultant , for instance , change the project in which they are working every week , so they have to deal with different subject , such a telecommunication , energy resource , economy . .. that is what i like !!! however , a i said before , many people decide to specialize in a field . this is the case of proffessors at university . for example , in the faculty of chemistry we can find different department : organic chemistry , inorganic chemistry , thermodinamics . .. proffessors have to specialize in a subject because they are dealing every day with the same aspect , and they need to know a much a possible about a certain field . the best of all would be to have a large knowledge of lot of subject , but this is not possible today for human being , because our brain can not retain so much information . even though , i have heard of people that have studied like 5 or 6 degree . i think this is fantastic !!! this people are very lucky of being so intelligent . all in all , i think that in the world should be both kind of people : those who specialize and those who have a broad knowledge of different subject , because both of them are neccessary in different situactions .
