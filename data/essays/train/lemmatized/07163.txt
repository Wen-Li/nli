i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . it 's important for example for a business man who his successful to continue to be successful and to continue to increase his business . firstly , a successful person is a person who never stop and always try to do better than what he ha done before . a successful person is generally an ambitious person , who ha goal in his life , and it 's this strong ambition that push him to achieve the limit , to try new thing and take risk , iven if that could cause problem to him and it 's a difficult task . for example a successful builder entrepreneur normally will try to improve his business . so , he will try to build new house for example and sell them in order to have a gain , and he will risk his money , because maybe there will be problem or he will not arrive to gain money . .. this person could do other kind of projets , with other people , and he will always take some risk , but he want to continue to be successful and feel proud of his work . in contrast with successful people , other people feel comfortable with what they already have and do n't take risk . secondly , other people do n't want to take risk . they know something to do well and have fear of the future , or are not enogh confident , and there is n't enogh ambition . to conclude , i agree with the statement presented on the question for the several reason cited before .
