young people and communities in our developing world many thing being changed . nowadays , young people do not spend their time for their comminications . i agree , that young people do not give enough time for the community . i beleive that young people ha some reason for to not have enough time for community . first of all , our world changing everday . nowadays people need money to stay alive so it is sometimes hard to spend time to helping community . being a human brings more resposilities and hard work . some young people working in part time job they do not only earn money but also they earn experience . for instance ; i do not hate to spend time for my community on the contrary i love it . in fact , i am working in my business and studying in university so i do not have enough time for my community . world getting harder and harder each day to stay alive thats why young people spendign their time mostly to earn money . secondly , there is other reason which is effective on young people to not have time for comminity . in our world technology developes by day and day . after internet ha been dicovered young people get worse and worse cause of it push person to lonely life . i accept that internet make our life easier while we loose our young generation to spend more time on internet instead of our community . for example ; i prefer to stay at home and surf on internet rather that to spend time in my community . in conclusion , i think , that young people have reason to not spend their time in communties . i belive that young people will have more time to spend their time to helping their community in the future .
