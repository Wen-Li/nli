`` knowledge is power '' is the great saying that everyone know it . one can be succesful if he have wide range of knowledge . i personally feel that it is better to have knowledge of all the subject upto high school level and at university level it is better to go for specialization in a single subject area according to the interest of the student . if a person opt for a single subject he better understands the subject . he may put all his effort and keen interest in a single subject . he go deep into the subject and can play with it . this lead to many innovation in that particular area . for example a person like charlesbabbage invented computer which is the popular instrument that world is using today if he had not dedicated to the physical science this might may not happen . if a historian is not dedicated to humanity we might not know the past culture . thus opting for a single subject lead to many advantage . there are also some benefit if people have a broader knowledge of many acadamecis but fundamental of all subject are enough to become a master in a paritcular area . lots of subject lead to confusion and one may not adopt a complete knowledge of all subject . so what i think is knowledge in one particular subject is more beneficial than to have a broad knowledge in all subject though there is a necessity of having basic knowledge of all subject
