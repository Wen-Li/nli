in my opinion , a a student , it is very important to go deeply to parsue the knowledge in my major . however , it is also important to learn and have broad knowledge in different acadimic subject . from my own experience , it is very crucial for me , a computer science student , to learn more and more in my major . this knowledge make me proffessional and expert in my specialization and this in turn will benify me . for example , my grade will be high and when i graduate , i 'll have the apportunity to continue my study . even more , if i want to work in a university or any other company , i think it will be easy . on the other hand , the scociety , that i am living in , is not only computer science . there are many other science and topic i have to be a ware about . for instance , i can not imagine that i 'll sit with my friend and other people talking about some topic and i know nothing about it ! so , it is important also to have broad knolwedge about many acadimic subject . unfortunately , in my university it is not allowed to take subject out of my field . if they allow that , i 'll be really happy to take subject in accounting , art , and history . in conclusion , it is important to go deep in your major and parsue every new in it . but also it is necessary to have broad knowledge that ables you to communicate with other people .
