in modern society , we always face the dilemma whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . it is such a debated problem in that it effect everybody in our life . according to different background , people may have quite different choice . some may frown to it , because they think if they specialize in one specific subject , they can achieve more success , . while others may say yes , since they perfer to contact with all kind of knowledge . when it come to me , i tend to agree with the second opinion , that is , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . to start with , broad knowledge is quite essential in social communication . there is no denying that human are social being , we need to communicate with others . but it take all sort to make a world , some are teacher , some are doctor , and others may be scientist . if we have no knowledge of other field except your own learning area , it can be quite different to make friend with them . you may even do not know how to start a conversation , it can be quite frustrated . besides communication , there is another important point . in certain time , some knowledge in other area is needed in our daily life . last summer , i went to a small town near the ocean with several friend . we wa deeply moved by the beautiful scenery there , the beach is always full of sunshine . we loved to relax ourselves on the beach when the sun is setting sun , the breeze is blowing and seabird are singing . we went to a seafood restaurant nearby , the seafood there can be the best in the world . but at this time , my friend felt quite uncomfortable . at first all of u did not know what wa wrong , suddenly i reminded a medcine book i have read before . i happened to know that he seemed to be allergetic to this kind of seafood . so i went to the clinic and bought the right medcine for him . you see , sometimes these knowledge can be quite useful `` it is always benefical to open a book '' a the old saying say , similarly , it is always benefical to gain knowledge , it can help u to know more about ourselves a well a this world . so that this plant will be a better place to live in . based the discussion above , knowledge which is a integrel part in our life should always be required by human being no matter which kind of knowledge .
