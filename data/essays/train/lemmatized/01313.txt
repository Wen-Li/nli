when you are visitng a new country for first time , it 's usual that you do n't know the principal and interesting touristic point , even in city like paris , where are place like the eiffel tower and the louvre museum , there 's differentes place to visit and know . in this case , i think that the best way to travel is un a group led by a tour guide . first of all , a tour guide know the whole city , and he/she can tell u a lot o interesting information of the place tha we are going to visit , for example , in the winter of last year , i went to canada with my family , it wa the first time , and we traveled in a group with a tour guide . when we were in quebec , joan ( the guide 's name ) , took u to a place in where we can walk in the snow for a long time ( it wa a hughe forest ) , and we can travel withs dog , like the skimals in the north pole . that kind of place are n't known by common or foreign people , and we cant share and enjoy that new experience with the whole group . in other word , there a lot of advantage traveling with a tour guide , another example , last week i went to acapulco beach , in mexico , i love that place , i know `` all '' the interest place , restaurant , bar , popular beach , because i travel to acapluco since i wa a kid . but , two day ago , i wa talking with my friend 's sister , who is a tour guide , and when i wa talking about my travel to acapulco , and talking about those interest place , she asked to me about `` laguna de chacagua '' , chacaguas lagoon in english , and `` barra vieja beach '' , and a few more place , i wa surprised because i know acapulco very well , but y did't heard about that place ever . and i said to her tha i would like to know that part of hidden acapulco . for that reason , i think that travel with a group led by a tour guide is the best option for new place and known place .
