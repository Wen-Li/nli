if someone told me that it 's better to have broad knowoledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject i would say he is right . if you choose to have broad knowledge of many academic subject you have the possibility to choose better in future in which subject you want to specialize . in addition you can decide which kind of job you will do in a better way , because if you 're not specialized in one specific subject you can count on your broad skill to do various job . besides you do n't need to spend a lot of time on the same subject , and it 's for me an advantage because studying the same subject for many year could be quite boring if you realize that you do n't like that subject . on the other hand if you like the subject you have choosen and if you choose to specialize in one specific subject , you have the possibility to study what you like but it can even be possible that you don'like that subject thus you will be frustrated for the choice you 've made . i 'm a student of management engineering at politecnico of milan and i took this choice of academic course just for these reason . because i know that this course can give me a broad knowledge of academic subject . in conslusion i can say that having a broad knowledge is better than having a specialized knowledge because it give you more possibilies to decide your future , more possibility to change your future and because this choice give you the possibility to be more happy of what you 've choosen .
