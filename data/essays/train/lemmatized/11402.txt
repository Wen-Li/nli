most advertisments make product much better when you see the actual product , because when you see in the add you dont see the actull thing . they only show you the best of it . when you deside to buy it hten you fids that it is not a best it wa said in the add , it is all a small game to make the coustomer buy the product . by making a coustomer buy the product , he/she most of the time forgets to return it back or desides to return it back after 30 day , it help the marchant to sell the product by all mean . the product which is mostly shown in commercial is not the best , i always thing the the product which you go to the shop and purchase is the best option . i have purchased several item from the advertisement , but most of dont look the same sa shown in tv , so all the time i have to make it a point to return in time so that i can get my money return . i thing the best way to buy any thing you should go and see the produt by your naked eye and then deside you need to buy it or not . i thing that is the only best way to buy any thing in life . the tv add thing some of them are really good too , like i have purchased a boss wave music it is the best , i like very much . thaat wa the only thing that i have purchased by add and turned out to be good . so i sugest that to buy mostly only by going to the shop and seeing the thing by yourself , it is very important to see the thing and then you can deside to buy or not .
