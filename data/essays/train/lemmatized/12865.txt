the humankind always need to take risk to reach good life standard therefore taking risk is a very important aspect of humanslife . some think that doing what they already know how to do well is better in contrary to those think that trying new thing and takeing risk is more important to be successful . in my point of view , i personally agree the second idea . these are my following reeasons . first of all , taking risk is important to struggle with the difficult life condition . for example , some people prefer to do only one sport which is really easy such a jogging , cycling . of course all sport are beneficial for most of them ; however , if people want to enjoy the life more and be more healtier , they should try new and risky sport . it should n't be afraid of them to do risky sport . in addition to this , taking risk is a fundemental issue because of the experience the life more deeply . for instance , i always do the most difficult test first at school . because i want to see my worst result first and then decide what can i do to improve it . although it mean taking risk , i prefer to do it and anytime i did n't face with a bad situation . therefore , it is really beneficial . the last but not least , taking risk is also important to see which can we do the best . for example , a footballer prefer to run not to long in the exercise . while he is doing that he doe n't know if he run very long distance , after that he can be better in his job . thats why it is important . all in all , a i said before to try new thing and take risk is better that doing what they already know how to do well . in this content , to struggle with the difficult life condition , to experience and to see which can we do the best are my reason . not only for successful people but also all of them , risk must be a part of our life in order to win the life exam whether we accept or not !!!
