personally speaking , i totally disagree with this statement . first of all , i think young people do n't have the enough time to enjoy their life . for example , young people , no mater where they are , will have to spend major of their time and energy `` starting '' their life instead of enjoying their life . they have to spend 8 or more hour working everyday and even work overtime on weekend . and i am not surprised to see young people working like dog . as a result , they are short of time to enjoy their life . while on the contrary , old people , on a large part , have retired from their work . so understandably , with all the time available , they can set out to enjoying their life either by staying at home and watching tv all day without worrying about the work load or traveling around the world to different place . second , young people do n't have the necessary amount of money to enjoy life . because the majority of young people 's income is spent to support the whole family and to maintain their competitive advantage in their own field by often taking up some training program , they barely have any extra money to enable them to enjoy life . however , with all the saving the old people have made during all those year and no further need for them to get promoted , they can safely begin to enjoy their life in whatever way they want to enjoy . finally , with the demand of their work and their family , young people never get around to thinking about how they can enjoy their life and the fact that they do n't exactly know what life is , due to their limited life experience , ha enormously deterred young people to enjoy their life to the greatest extent . but on the other hand , old people have experienced a lot in their own life course , they well know what life is and how they can enjoy it and consequently , old people enjoy life more than young people do .
