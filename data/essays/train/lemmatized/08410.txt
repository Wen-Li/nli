i disagree with the idea that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i disagree with this because of the several reason . the first reason why i disagree that there will be fewer car is that the main cost associated with the maintenace of the car is petrol . many people do n't want to buy a car because of this cost . with the growing technology people might come up with substitute of petrol . and then it would be easier for many people to maintain the car at low cost . so they will tend to buy more car . the second reason why i disagree that there will be fewer car is that it could be more cheaper in future . there are many people who want to buy car but they are not able to afford it becasue they do n't have the sufficient money or the car loan interest rate is too high . so in future if the new car with low cost will be introduced it will be easily accessable by each class of the society . or it is possible that with the growth of economy people can avail loan at low rate , that will again help them in buying car . third reason for expectation of more car in future is that people are now leaving in the joint family . one car can be used by the whole family . as these day these idea of joint family are not liked by many people , there is a consistent growth in nuclear family . in such case each nuclear family will need a seperate car . so that will increase the number of car in use . after considering all these factor i would like to conclude that i disagree with the statement that in future there will be fewer car in use than there are today . with the expectation of growth in each field wether it 's technology or economy or any other field we can surely expect that more car will be used in future .
