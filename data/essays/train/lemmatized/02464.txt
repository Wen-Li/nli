i agree with the statemnt that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . having broad knowledge in one subject confines you only to one field of study . not only that but it also confines your mind to not think about anything else except thatsuject . the other disadvantage is that having in depth knowledge in one subject also confines your future job oppurtunities because of lack of knowledge in other field . so it is always beneficial to have knowledge of many academic subject . by having knowlege in all sujects the individual is more accomplished to solve any problem in any field . it also increase the fleibility of the person . his futue will also be very bright a he will have sound knowledge in all the subject though acquiring knowledge is tough and also a time taking process it is definitly worth the hard work a u are presnted with fruitful reward . for example jon and smith work in the same office jon ha knowlege about all the subject where a smith only specialized in technical detail of the company . when a prolem arises in the technical department . both of them can solve the problem easily . but when a problem arises in the managemet department only jon can solve the problem . so jon can solve both the management and the technical problem . where a jon can solve only the technical problem . so jon is more flexible in his work than smith is and ha a definite edje over smith not only this having knowledge in different subject also increase the efficiency of a human being . he can definitely do more work if he ha sound knowledge in different field . so i conclude that it is always better to have broad knowledge of many subject rather than specializing ione specific subject .
