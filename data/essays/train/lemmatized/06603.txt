i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than a very good knowledge on only one subject . i think that if you got a broad knowledge , you will know what people mean when they talk aboute a topic you have heared aboute , even if you dont know much aboute it . you are not focused on your special subject tho whole time . you can free your mind , you are open for new thing . although the knowledge of only one subject , your special subject , offer good ability for you , i prefer knowing le thing aboute many subject . later you also got the chance to become a specialist in your subject , you can still sharp your skill , but at the biginning you should be ready and be prepared for thing who can happen to you . maybe you then go on with subject , you did n't know some year before . for example , if you have got no job and you are looking for one you have a big space to seach for it and you might can get a job which you did n't expected . if you are just a specialist in you subject , you might find faster a job , but only about you main knowledge . it will be very boring for you to do just the same thing your whole life . i think so , because this is what happened to my father . he first sharped his doctorial skill , because he wanted to become a doctor , but he also studied law . now he is a laywer . this show me that you have to be prepared for ability you might get , but to do so you have to have a broad knowledge about many subjectcs , including academic . this is necessary to have a good and not boring job in the future .
