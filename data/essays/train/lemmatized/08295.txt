some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . some say it doe not . in my opinion , however , young people enjoy life rather than older people do because , they are impulsive , energetic , and creative . firstly , it is generally accepted that young people are more impulsive than old people . therefore , young people use to do thing without certain plan . for example , in my personal experience , i had been on trip without any plan with my friend . one day , one of my friend suddenly suggested to go trip and we just agreed to go trip in that day , because we were young and impulsive . secondly , it it normally accepted that young people are more energetic rather than old people . in fact , it is hard to enjoy life such a go trip or go picnic for old people because they are le energetic . however , young people are always energetic in general . therefore , it can be described one reason that young people enjoy life more than older people do . lastly , it seems clear that young people are more creative than old people . they always bring something new and creative and move into action . it is a one of way that they enjoy their life creatively . moreover , in my personal experience , one day , i and my friend were thinking about making fake id . therefore , we moved into action and tried it . unfortunately or fortunately , we were charged by a police officer lightly , however , it exists a a still interesting memory for me . to sum up , i can generally state that young people enjoy life more than older people do . in my home country , there is a old traditional song about that enjoying life when we are young , when we become old then we can not . all thing considered , it is true about that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
