in our society advertising ha become the morst important aspect of business . anywhere you go , it is possible to find any kind of advertisement that try to convince you to buy anyhting . one one side of the street you see that the cheese produced by x is the most delicius and soft you would ever taste . the advertisement would be for sure full of colour and happy people on it . on the other side you might find another advertisement about the cheese produced by y , and may be the colour of the poster are le bright than the other , and the people are le actractive . so you decide to buy the chees from the company x , but once you open it and you eat a piece of it , it is disgusting and not soft at all . obviously you get disappointed : it wa not what you were expecting . but the envelope wa very nice and colourful . some time advertisement promise you miracle : '' buy this wash machine ! all your shirt will be perfectly white , even if your child put chocolate and grass on it ! you will not have to spend time in ironing , because the washmachine will do it for you ! '' so you spend a fortune to buy something that theoretically should make your life easier , but unfortunately you will soon find out that these were just word . most probably you will have to buy a new stock of t-shirts for your child and spend a lot of time ironing all the cloth . we know that advertisement make product to seem much better than what they really are , but most probably we want to believe them becasue we would like to have an easier life , le frenetic and dreamfull . different company , same product : they have to attract a many costumer a possible if they want to survive in the jungle of business , so they obviously have to exagerate the quality of their product . we can not blame them too much , we just have to be careful when we decide to buy something and not choose and item only according to it envelope .
