i completaly agree with the point that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are and to elplain my point here are some example which we see in our daily life . advertisements are to promote the product and to make the consumer feel that this is something really big for example there is a advertisement for hidden vally ranch salad dressing and it go like this , there is a girl sitting in her dining room and she take a bite from her salad boul . the moment she take a bite the backgroung of her dining room change and she is presented a sitting in a garden under the tree and all is so nice and green and the weather had change after eating that salad and she is in new land and happy . the point is can any one really get transfered from a busy and stressfull life of city to a nice and pleasent life of country side ranch by just eating a salad dressing this is not true and they really make product seem better than it really is . another example is of the the crest toothpaste in the advertisement it tell that it if u start useing the crest whiteing tooth paste ur teeth will be white a pearl in few day . but theortically it ha been proven that every human being have a different color of there teeth based on the mineralization that took place during the formation of teeth , there surroundings , there genetics some tribe have whiter teeth than the other , there eating habbits etc . simply brushing the teeth will not make them pearl white . another example is of a nutrigrain bar . in the advertisement it say that just haveing the bar will fill u with energy and u will feel really good and strong . the actor in the advertisement start jumping and make u feel like u will be all muscular and strong by just eating one bar . conclusion is most of the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are and i totally agree with the point .
