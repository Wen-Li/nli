i disagree with the statement . i think it is more intereting to travel alone or by a relatively small size of the group without a tour guide . there are two main reason to support my idea . first , it is true that to have a tour guide with u are better for the instruction about the sight-seeing place . however , i prefer to look up into the guide book by myself and imagine how to travel by my own way . when i traveled kenya alone , it wa really alone and little bit scarely . i have to speak by myself , look into the book , and communicate by my self . to tell the truth , that wa the most exciting experience that i ever had when travelling . because i wa alone , i really feel everything from bottom of my heart , and had a peaceful mind to think of many thing freely . secondly , if there are friend or the people around me , that is fun only with that situation a i can talk a lot with such a people . however , i will loose my tentions to see carefully around myself . also , if the tour guide explaine about the place in detail , i will become more passive to the situation . how can i remember these sight from heart ? it is doutful . furthermore , i do not want to travel in a noisy large group with only japanese . i can share my pleasure for sure , but may annoyed by some noisy , impolite people . that is the worst thing . for these reason , i prefer to travel individually with making intereting plan and see whatever i want to talking with not only friend but also the local people a lot . that will sure to make the voyage intereting and effe
