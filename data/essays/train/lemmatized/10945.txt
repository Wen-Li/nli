some people believe that it is better to have broader knowledge than specialize knowledge , others think not . in my opinion , i would agree with this statement . there are many reason a followed . to begin with , we could combine many different knowledge into one way . if we learn a many academic subject a we can , we might put them together one day , and invention will happened . take the invention of cellphone for example . as we know , somone invented traditional phone , he used his academic field to invent it . but , nowadays , we increase the profit on many special kind of cellphone . that is , what will make commercial profit ? it is not only the professional part but also combine others , such a ad and design . in addition , we can communicate with each other by using other several academic knowledge . in the other word , our friend may appriciate u because of our wide knowlege . we will not have a good social relationship if we only concentrate on our own field . it is because that we are too boring to stay with . thus , we should get more and more academic subject a we can , then we can chat with any kind of friend who take part in different field . however , we should also specialize our academic subject . it is because that when we work in our professional part , we should give a confidence to our customer , it is impossible that we put too many emphasis on other thing but can not answer any question which our customer asked . moreover , we should study hard to our own academic field and we could get a better job than broader knowledge . as all reason i have mentioned above , the first is that it is important that having broad knowledge to combine them into a new one . the second reason is that it is easier to communicate with any kind of person . furthermore , if you want to get a better job , you should specialize your academic subject .
