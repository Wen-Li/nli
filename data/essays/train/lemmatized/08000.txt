i agree with the statement that most advertisement overexagerate the qualitiy of product . this trend can be found in all varities of ad , including print , film and audio . some example where advertisments make product seem much better than they really are include , but are not limited to the following : laundry detergants and cosmetical article are often shown in ad , where the effect of their use are made to look much better than they actually are . weight loss product and exercising equipment are commonly advertised by using before-and-after picture of people , who deliberatly gained body mass over a short period of time and thus allowing them to regain their ideal body weight easily in a short time . also professional athelets are used to promote certain article , creating the impression that the application of the product led to the result and not the year of hard work and traditional exercise . today , where consumer use tool such a the internet or magazine to research the quality of a product , such a consumer report or the j.d. power survey , exageration ha lost some of it potential for persuading consumer , a long a the customer is carefull about not making impulsive desicisons to purchase a product . exageration is not in all case used to mislead the consumer , but also a an intrument to point out certain feature or quality of a product , that might not be notable at first sight , for example a refinement in a recipe or an increased package size . this is also used when there are only slight variation with an competitive product , for example fuel - efficency with car , calorie in hamburges , or interest rate in the financial world . if an advertisement with great exageration is used , it a humoerous way to make the consumer remember the product . in conclusion exageration is used to point out quality of a product , make it stand out from competitor , create an memeroable ad , or even mislead the consumer about the product quality and benefit .
