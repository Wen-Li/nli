`` jack of all trade and master of none '' . well yes ! i totally agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i look at eductaion a primarily an aid to better living , enriching life of the recipient with it vast and varied database . life itself can not be compartmentalised into few specific . it is actually the amalgamation of a wide gamut of experience , problem , oppurtunities , success , failure , emotion , relationship and the like . thus , to deal with such a vast range of thing definitely requires some sort of formal education about the broad feature of various academic subject . for example , for a home-maker , to successfully run and manage the house , only an education in basic cooking or rather the home-sciences is not enough . he/she need also to be equipped with the broad detail of mathematics , economics , social science , etc. to be able to better execute the responsibility at hand . further i believe that knowledge of diverse domain promotes the all-round development of an individual . the person is much better aware of the socio-political factor affecting him and his surroundings and is able to make informed decision about his life in particular and the society in general . on the other hand , a specialist in a particular field might find it quite challenging to deal with issue that are beyond his domain . this will put him at a great disadvantage a compared to the other generalist in his surroundings . in term of interpersonal relationship also , the specialist find it quite difficult to relate to people who are not from their field of study . on the other hand , having being exposed to a broad spectrum of topic , the generalist find it quite comfortable to get along with even radically different people . this help in strengthening their contact and improving their communication skill . lastly i feel that since we have only one life to live , we must make the most of it and fill up our life with a many possible experience that we may percieve so that we may not have any regret on having missed out on anything in life .
