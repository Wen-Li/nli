in general , i do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . however i would maybe change this statement into : young people nowadays are not given enough time to helping their community . i think that today many people , particularly young people , just do not have the time to care about their community . they are involved into too many other activity . the pressure from school for example and all the other possibility and offer provided by advertisment do distract them from any social activity or project . another reason why i approve of this statement is that i think young people do not really have too many possibility to get involved into any social project . the community do actually rather care about current problem with policy and administration , so that even they are not really able to spend too much time on thinking about involving youngster . the only opportunity for helping the community , which is taken by most young men , is doning the civil service or going to the military after finishing school . but even this opportunity is actually not taken voluntarily but one is actually forced by government to do any of these two service . of course if young people would be more interested in helping their community they could maybe gain some access to some helping organzations . but a long a this interest doe not exist and a long a the community do not offer any urgent project to them , community wont get any more help from young people . most young people do care about their family and friend very much . and if anybody ha a problem most young people are willing to help . consequently you see that there is not a lack of common interest but there is just a lack of connection between young people and community .
