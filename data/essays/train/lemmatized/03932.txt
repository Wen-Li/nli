i agree with the statement in which it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . there is several reason why i think so . first , if you have broad knowleadge of many kind of academic subject , you can communicate with many kind of people . in other word , you can talk with a person who are studying international politics and economics and law if you have any knowledge . in opposite side , if you have only knowledge of law , you ca n't talk with a person learning about economics . second , by gaining widespread knowledge , you can be interested in various subject . i think that 's so nice . if you have interest in various subject , then you will have more way you can choose in your life than a person who ha interest in only one thing . finally , we should get a much knowleadge a possible while we are living . i think knowing is growing , so we can grow until die .
