i have ever believed that it is more important for student to understands concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all , when one understands something he or she probably remeber this idea for a long time . instead when one just learn a fact , probably he or she soon forget it . next , when one understand an idea , it is possible to reuse this idea in similar context that simetimes have to be faced during one 's life . as einstein said , `` imagination is more important than knowledge '' , and i think that undertanding effort stimulates imagination , a well a the ability to infer . moreover , whenever one understand a new difficult concept , he or she feel a kind of satisfaction and become a little more confident . i think that this is important to find out new breakthrough and the world ha ever improved thanks to new idea and discovery . however , learning fact is important too . for instance i think that studying history is helpful to avoid error and mistake . in fact studying history , student learn bad consequence of war and mistake in general so that they can do better in the future . in conclusion i think that that student should do their best in order to undertand the more they can from teacher 's lecture and book .
