there are many new thing surrounding u and waiting for u to take an adverture on them . sometimes when i switched on the television , there are some programme concerning about how do people success , or which way they are going in order to become a successful person . i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . on the following paragraph , i will explain the reason for that . first , if you do not take any risk , you will not know what it will be after you have tried it . though you may fail , you will gain some experience on that . for example , some successful people are very poor and do not have enough money to deal with business . but they still tried to use that small amount of money in a useful way . though you have to bear a high risk , it is wealthy for you to do that . second , accept others opinion . sometimes we think that we already know how to deal with all the thing and we just follow our own way to go , but actually we are not . we should accept more suggestion from the others and try to think over all the thing that they mentioned but do not think i can do this well with just a little experience on that . third , they always try new thing and treat themselves a a new entrant . as a new entrant , you will eager to know more thing and learn more from the others rather than become a senior on certain thing . you may try new thing and see whether you can handle this problem or not . there are so many stuff that you have never been encoutered before . and always trust and build up confident to yourself that you can do that . some people think that they can do well according to their `` limited '' knowledge . they never try to explore some useful and helpful information to help them . that is why they can not become a successful person and still walking in the same square . therefore , take risk and try more new thing can help you widen your sight and knowlege . at the same time , to become a successful person .
