in my perspective , i believe that the number of car will be reduced in twenty year from today . at first , the petrolleum crisis will affect directly on the production of car . because it ha been estimated that the world will run out of petrolleum in twenty year from now . that 's why the world have to find another source of energy instead . recently , the scientist have invented a car which run on the hydrogenic energy . however , it 's not a efficient a the petrolleum , also they found it more expensive than the petrolleum . secondly , the environmental crisis that the car made from it exhaust . the environmental association will not be satisfied about what 's happening . they will force car manufacture to reduce there production of car in reason of what environmental threat caused by car exhaust . furthermore , i think that the mechanical energy will be the most common after twenty year from now . it 's not that worthy for ordinary people , and it will be common used instead of car . thus , that 's why i am totally agree with the statement that say : `` in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today ''
