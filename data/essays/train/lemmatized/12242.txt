i agree with the statement that , young people enjoy life more that older people do . there are 3 reason why i agree with that opinion . first of all , for young people most of the thing they experience are new and they facinate young people . young people have curiosity and it motivates them to do thing and try many thing . i believe that trying to do something is essential for my life and it is the best way to enjoy my life . however elderly people know what is interesting and what is not , and they easily give up trying . secondly , young people often worry . they worry about their future , love , relationship between their friend or family and so on . while they are worrying about these thing there are lot of talking , laughing and cry and that make people grow up . young people often have more dificulties than elderly people do , and it is because taht young people have le knowledge . but i do not think having le knowledge for life experience is bad thing . it also can motivate people . usually , older peoople use their knowledge of their experience and avoid having difficulty and chose easier way . it is not an interesting thing for me at all . third reason is concerned about physical problem . when people get older , that is natural that you have more physical problem that you used to when you were young . physical and phycology effect each other , so when older people get physical pain , they might be nervouse and do not feel like doing anything . actually , my grand mother used to play golf untill about she wa 55 , but since she got a pain on her knee , she stopped playing golf and the more , she stopped going outside . i wa very sad i saw her always sitting on a chair and watching tv . but young people have much le physical problem so that we can try anything we want to . young people are hopefull and have lot of energy . when you get older and reflect yourself for not to do anything you wanted to , is what i hate the most . challenging is the best thing to satisfy your life . for those reason i believe that young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
