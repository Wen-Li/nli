in my opinion it is more important to understand the main idea and principle of what you are supposed to learn than to learn some fact by heart . if you only learn some procedure or fact by heart , you wo n't be able to tailor your knowledge to a new task . and i think you will forget this knowledge very soon . for example i have learned very much for the final exam in history by heart , but after that exam i have forgotten all these fact very rapidly . but on the other hand i have tried to understand everything in math and i still can rememder most of the knowledge i needed for the final exam . and the grade in math wa by far better than the grade in history . that is the main point why i think understanding the idea and concept is more important than learning fact by heart . nevertheless , there are some thing you have to learn by heart , because without some key fact you can not understand some idea . one example is that you can not calculate a maximum of a function , that is to illustrate profit figure , without having learned what the definition of profit is and without knowing how to find out where the maximum is . as one can see from the example given in my text , learning fact by heart ha a very limited usability for new problem but there are some occasion in which one can not avoid learning key fact by heart , because otherwise one can not understand certain concept . nevertheless , i think it is clear that understanding the principle and idea is superior to stupidly learning fact by heart . another important advantage of understanding the idea behind a certain fact is that you can easily find a perfect solution for problem that are based on the same idea in notably shorter time and that you do not have to learn every scenario by heart , because you can derive it from a `` basic '' scenario . so you have to keep le in mind .
