i agree with the fact that most advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are . of course when you watch television a lot of infomations and picture go in your brain . you record all you have seen and after you want to buy it it 's a fact . but when you go in a restaurent for exemple sometimes you are very desapointed because it doe n't look at all with what you 've seen on television . the producer are really strong because they can make an illusion of lot a thing and the people fall in this illusion . i have a personal exemple for this situation . last nignt i wa watching television and i saw an advertisement about the newest cell phone . the commercial said that he is very small , one the most resistant . .. in fact one of the most everything . when i went in the cell phone shop indicated on the advertisement i discover that the phone wa very big that he wa n't at all resistant and in fact that he wa very bad . i understood after that it wa only a commercial witch make me go to the cell phone store to buy an another phone . i got punked by this wrong advertisement . and i do n't think i am the only one who leave this experience in fact i believe that everyday people like me do the same thing but some people sometimes doe n't go back like me and on the contrary enter in this vicious circle . it 's the purpose of those commercial . it 's to send you somewhere to make you buy something you did n't need at first . but whe cant always said that the commercial are trying to play with u . sometimes the commercial are true and show u true thing . they do n't play this game often ( make product seem much better tan they really are ) because in this case a lot of person will be sent to jail !
