i agree with the topic that `` it is more important to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact '' . understanding the idea and concept ultimately lead to fact that is we need not learn the fact . understanding idea and concept mean having an indepth knowledge about a topic . learning fact mean mugging up the topic in a subject for some student . if student wont understand idea then they will be unable to develop the logic and creative thinking . for example let u take mathematics , in mathematics it is very important to know what actually problem is , way to resolve it and how to approach the problem . if student dont know about basic idea or concept of problem , he will never be able to resolve it . in mathematics merely knowing the formula is not enough but one should know basic idea of applying it to solve the problem mportant . sometimes we believe the fact like `` pluto is a planet '' a our teacher said in our earlier class , but now it really matter that whether it is a planet or a kbo . this implies that the thing we consider a fact earlier is no more a fact . there are many instance like the above in history . let me quote another example that is during ancient civilisation our ancestor considered earth to be flat , but with the invention of galilio 's telescope people changed the attitude that earth is no more a flat surface but a eliptical sphere . this is possible only by understanding the concept of physic and mathematics . finally what i mean to say is that just simply learning the fact is not enough but we should learn to understand the idea and concept so we can explore new invention and theory . if scientist would have satisfied with learing fact then world would be at standstill , but their quest for deep understanding of idea and concept paved the way for new research and invention .
