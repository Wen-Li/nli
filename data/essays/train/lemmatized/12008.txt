in daily life there are a lot of product and some of this are not so good , but most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ! yes , i am agree with this statement because i think that a person have to touch with his hand the product he need becase if we follow only the advertisement he can fall in a not good product . for example , if i have to buy something product the first thing is watch this prodict and analyze it because i want to know it is good or not . is like buy a t-shirt of a famouse stilist or a not famouse stilist , all the people prefer the first one because have the name but when they buy it , they do not look the material ( for example ) , they buy it because is made from a famous stilist . but if we research more and more in another store i think that we can find a better t-shirt with a low cost . another example is a dish soap that i call with the name ` a ' , the advertisement say that a can clean everithing and your dish will be white like the best white thing . than a person go to buy it because the advertisement say that a do miracle , and when he wash his dish , he observe that what the advertisement say is not true ! than , in summary i want to say that is important to think befor to do everything especially when we have to choose some product to buy , because sometime we can take a product that most advertisement make much better than thy really are and everytime this is a tipical thing for to spend a lot of money for a product that is not good . the first thing to do is think and the second is choosing the best product for it quality and for it cost .
