i will justify my view on three different point : i have to disagree with this statement , firstly because of the current context which is that on an average basis , people have at least one car if not two . they keep getting aware of the importance of pollution and the ecologic problem it cause , nevertheless , they go on using their car daily even for short and unsignificant distance . for example , most people will take their car to go to work or to go on vacation , which is justified , but they also will use it to go to the movie , a they could perfectly use the transportation . it is by getting more and more lazy that they end up using their car for any distance . the second reason why i disagree with this statement , is the fact that people are very much into high technology and each time more modern technology . so many different type of car are created a the year go by and it keep on improving . so in this statement my point is that people first think about their own interest and what is best for them and certainely not about collective interest . they always want to go faster , we besides could compare this to airplane that are built ( like the concorde ) which main purpose is again to always go faster . at last , the third reason i will mention is that the car market is in constant growth , so it is a consistant part of the economy going on , not only for the seller , but also for the oil market . the people who rule and control this most important commerce involve way too much work and effort to have their sell decreased . they do n't have the luxury to have le costumer country , especially when we know how rare and difficult it get to pump oil out of it element nowadays .
