in my student experience , i often used the memory to learn the fact , in the case of the lesson with a lot of date , name or formula but i 've always had the fundamental idea that studying without understanding principle , concept that are at the basis of the fact could be an unuseful work . in fact , knowing the einstein 's formula , but then not understanding the principle of the gravity energy is not intellingent , beacuse even if you worked only with your memory . my ph.d. advisor , a professor in coastal engineering , does't usually remember all of the drag coefficient value that appears in the darcy formula but he reflects about it significance and , using the knowledge of the pricipal law and the practical sense , is always able to give me the more realistic value for all of type of surface . i often loose this practical ability to understand the real problem and the idea that is hidden by the formula . for a student , it 's simpler to learn fact , even if often the professor asked them to refer themselves to a specific number , or a particula paragraph of the book . the student , also for this reason , is used to prefer to learn fact , without really comphend the general topic . now i 'm not a student and i know that only the really understood concept are placed in my mind while all the formula and number that filled my memory in thelast year , are now vanished . so , i usually suggest to my student to understand the concept that are below a formula or a mathematical law and to not learn only with the memory !!
