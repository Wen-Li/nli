whether most advertisement make their product seem much better than they really are ? different people have different opinion because of different way of thinking and experience . as for me , it is true that advertisement always exaggerate their product and try their best to attract customer . why do i think so ? because i have my real unhappy experience . for example , you can see the advertisement about shampoo everday . in the tv , the femal star display their beautiful hair proundly and the shining hair is so realistic that everyone belief that he or she can have such beautiful hair a long a he use the product . so am i. my hair is brown , not straight and not black enough . so i bought one of the product to improve my hair , dreaming oneday to display my beautiful hair to my husband . but , the effect wa not so obvious a the advertisement announced . i wa really dispoint and today my hair is still not shinning and brown . here is also one real case of my friend 's . everyone want to be tall and handsome , but my friend is short and she is really upset abouth that . someday , she saw a great advertisement about a new type medical device which can increase your height . the advertisement also gave a lot of sucessful case to confirm people that the medical machine really doe work . it even promised that customer can take their money back if the device is ineffective . my friend wa moved by the advertisement , rush out of the door and took one home from the company . she put on the device everday just a the explaining manul of the device told her . one month past , two month , then half a year , my friend wa still short a she wa . when she decided to return the medical device to the company and took her money back , she found that the company wa not exist anymore . maybe some people will think that it is just a small percent of advertisement which cheat customer . but is there any natural or thorough difference between cheating and exaggeration ? everday there are people such thing happen to . for example , `` perfect `` computer software make pc collapse tottally , `` unshrink '' fabric make clothes still shrink after washing . obviously , most advertisement do make product seem much better than they really are
