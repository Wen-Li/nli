life according to me is like a journey and unlike any journey it ha phase from juvanile to adolosent to adult and finally the old age i feel each part ha it own flavour it own enjoyment . when you are a child one basically learns , try to know more , understand thing . when a adolosent he reconfigures change and adjusts because he ha to cope with a lot of restriction , social norm and change inside . now come the youth when actually one is fully prepared to do thing his own way come out and declare his dream to the world and start working to achive them . actually it like when you were a child you , you were a child now you are grown up see for your-self , do for yourself and bare the consequence thus one becomes free and this freedom make him think what is doe he really want to do what he enjoys to do , waht he can do best . this realisation of indipendence economically and on the intellectual level make youth the best part of the journey for all . also when you are in your 20 's you are at the best of your mental and physical ablitys earlier you were weak and later also , thus it the apex of onse energy level and capablity hence one feel high and enjoys this height . you have some more people attached to them of the same age sharing the same vibrant enthusiasm and their for you making thing more exciting . so no doubt that youth is the best part . the old age i feel ha it own taste it the time when you see the path back , see what ever you have done and smile . the various expriences you had and the enormous difficulty you fought with , your adventure , your notty misdeed and grand achivements . also one get an overall understanding of how this all evolved and proceeded , why htings were so . thus is a nice repose from the fast and tedious journey you had , you know that the point where your shadow will set you free is near but also realise that a journey is never complete till one reach the last point of it hence you are still walking slowly , stedly and proud .
