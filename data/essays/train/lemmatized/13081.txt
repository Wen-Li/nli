in this case i could agree because when someone travel to a new place it because he/she want to know that place or spend a good time there . so i think when people look for help from a guide or someone who can help them , it would be a great idea to have fun and save time . people ask themselves . . why save time ? because in many time family or group of people who want to travel never take precaution about some risk that they could have in their travel . when we talk about risk we could say . .. they dont know the city , the dont know the culture ( differents country ) , they dont know a good place to stay or sometimes they dont speak the languague from that place , in many case people have been mad or sad because they lost time or they lost their vacation for dont take good precaution . therefore it vital when someone want to travel to take precaution . for other side when people know everything or almost everyting about the place , it not necesary to ask help to a guide . like that they can be alone and get privacity . also they can feel free when they want to choose their decision . in my case i like to plain before of travel , i wouldnt like loose my vacation or spend bad time . for me it different when i travel with my friend , because when we are young , we love the adventure and enjoy crazy time with your friend , of course . . with responsability . so when i travel with my friend i dont plain too much . in other side when i travel with my family it different because i travel with adult people , we look for spend a good time in family everyone together , therefore we have to plain better our trip . in conclution i agree with the statement because it better take precaution then spend a bad time looking for help .
