i agree ; because many academic subject are going to improve the knowlege of the student , to get more information in regard to what doe happen arround the word ; in addition the other subject that are not on the major is to make the student how can their specific subject contibute to others area . the first idea is to get more information that the academic people had gotten in a specfic subject . this is important because the student would be interested in regard to others assignatures like politics , economics , urbanism , etc . those assignatures are called `` general subjects '' . then when the student study those subject , they learned about what happened arround the world . this mean what are the cause that the fact success and the consequence ( good or bad ) these gave . for example : in my country , my major is computer engineering and the last term i learned about the urbanism , and the progression of the city arround the world , the cause of these progress in regard to the health and organization abuot the building and house . the result to this topic is to improve the student in regard to how can the specific subject contribute to these . this is the best part , because it make to built the answer in regard to the fact . in addition in my example : i can to reorganize the reality of the city , to help the government housing plan ; other could be , to vreate a tridimensional video to help the urbanism professor , expert and/or student ; or build a video-game about the race , war , trip , etc . i said in the beginning that this statement can help to the student to increase the information about the world .
