everyone know that advert are made on purpose to sell , it mean that product shown on televivion or in magazine do always look much better than in reality . sometimes it happens that you watch an advertisement on television , which tell you that a certain product is exactly what you need . basically they show you many evident quality , like bright color or enormous size , that are supposed to belong to the object , but once you arrive in the shop you get a huge disappointment : the thing you expected to be big and amazing is usually much smaller and doe n't really look like the one you have dreamt about . this point can easily be explained mentioning the psychology role in making advertisement . in fact , what product really need for being sold , is expectation . it mean that the value of an object is determined by the psycholocical impact this object is able to have on people . provided that behind every advertisement there is the long and hard work of a brilliant psychologist equipe , people should always try to look at icon through an objective point of view . for `` objective prospective '' i mean that people should try not to be influenced by external - and sometimes subliminal - message . message i am talking about are generally used by brand to drive people 's mind in a certain direction . so , according to what i have just analysed , i think that it is very important to be aware of what the bid compasnies are doing through advertisement . in my opinion advert - mechanism is a clear example of brain washing : without even know it , in some way we are forced to do something they want : buy their product . i reckon that this situation is very dangerous and terrible at the same time : i mean someone is controlling u , isn ' it scary ?
