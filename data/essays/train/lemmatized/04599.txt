in this contemporary world it is inevitable to be away from the tecnologigal development and the facility the life present u . one of these is of course the car whigh make our life easier and time-saving . some say that in twenty year time there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i actually disagree with this opinion because i believe that in this rapid change of the world noone can prevent the surprising innovation to be appeared on this very big stage of earth . thus , some people , such a scientist , manufacturer , government and the consumer also , wil urgently have to take some precaution a soon a possible ; otherwise the people living on earth can be face to face several harm and disadvantage of having that much of car where they live . first , there is a very overwhelming problem that must be taken into consideration on global base , that is pollution . too many car mean too much environmental problem . as a solution to this problem government should put great importance onto the public trasportation system . it wo n't merely solve the problem , but it will also be much more econemical at the same time . secondly , perhaps in twent year ' time , throughout which noone can be sure about what hi-tec movement se are going to see , people may be using some other way of transportation instead of having car . moreover , if this can not happen , there wo n't be even a bit of empty space
