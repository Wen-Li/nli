i agree with the follwing statement that said `` most adertisment make product seem much better than they really are . most of these advertisement decorates the producs and make it the best product , even when it is not true . bcause it will give penifit for the company that make the adevetisment and the company that ha the product in our life , when we watch tv , we see alot of advertisment that how they gain alot of money . for example , in arabian show especially in ramadhan ( that special month in arabian celander that people fasting during that month ) you see alot of show that attract people so the company for advertisment take this chance to insert their advertising durin these show . as a result of thic concept , they can gain alot of money . second , most new product when they want to be noticable or famous they tent to the advrtisment to succeede the product . not only to succeede the product , some company that find that people do not intersted in their product use advetising for that product , they tend to this way to be do not losing their product . in conlousion , this statment `` most advertisment make prouducts seem much better than they really are '' is true . that alot of people use advertisment to be foumous and every one know it and also all people love the money and like to gain alot of money . usaully my parent told me that the money and being foumous are the decoration of our life .
