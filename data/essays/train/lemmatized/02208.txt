i agree the opinion that most advertisement make poducts make better than they are . now we live in the high tech advanced society in the 21st century . all over the world are getting more smaller by using the computer use . we can exchange information togethe by all kind of communication system such a internet and mass medium . even though we purchase one item , we try to get information all of resource . for the good example , most advertisement make customer guarantee their product . in order to become good brand product to appeal to customer , the company focus on better product . we can n't deny the advertisement importance to relate the good product . most consumer think that better product are introduced into the televions , radio , and other mass medias . most advetisments should be implied that advertisement product gurantee good gualities to attract the customer . now most company recognize that advertisement product should be the best product than other one to succeed the business . to take example coca cola drink , it is not american drink any more . it is the world drink all over the global village . without advertisments , it ca n't be exist any more . in order to survive the world brand drink , they have continued to improve the best soft drink than other one . in the conclusion , i want to insist that more advertisement product should be recognized the better product than they really are .
