i agree with this statement . in fact i think that learning fact is useful , but not the important part of the study . if you learn only fact without understanding the concept of what you are studiyng , you will not have a complete knowledge about it , and so you will have only a superficial one of the theme . then , having a superficial knowledge about the theme mean that you are not able to make yourself a critical opinion about that and that you wo n't be able to discus it in a complete way . another reason is that fact are forgotten rapidly , with the result that in a short time you will not remember anything about the topic , whereas concept and idea remain more deeply in the brain . i know that there are many area of knowledge and in some of these area , such a engeneering for example , it is more important to learn fact and number than to understand fact . but also in these case a learning only based on fact is not effective : for example if you do n't understand a physic process you wo n't be able to make exercizes based on it , or however if you would find an exercize a little different from the one you have studied , you would n't be able to solve it . this is important not only at school but also in work , in which if you understand deeply a process , you are able to manage it and the people who have n't understood it
