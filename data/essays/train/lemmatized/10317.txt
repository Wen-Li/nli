the issue at hand is if young people nowadays participate enough in helping their community . this issue is important because it is directly related to our daily habit . in my view young people do not take the time to helping their community because they have other responsabilties to take care of first . first , young people first think to their obligation . school ha taken an important part in our student life which can not be neglictated . the work required from school is so abondant that it make more difficult for student to bring their help for their community . i think that can be consider a an eventual explanation of why young people do not give enough time for supporting their community . secondly , we are living in a society where appears more and more distraction . young people prefer getting some relax after school rather than getting involve to another thing . helping community required involvement and concentration which can be considered a similar a school so it is not really restfull . this point show another aternaltive to explain this fact . additionnally , a it ha been mentioned previously community required involvement from u which mean that we also have to be interesting in what they are goin to undertake . the subject or the action might just interest young people . for example , if our community want to prevent from steal or breakinf house they will need volunteer . if nobody ha encounter that kind of problem , they might not be interessting in getting involve to this . therefore not a lot of people will be in . this can be anothe aspect of the lack of yound people in helping their community . to sum it up , their involvment at school , the fact that there are more and more distraction and finally that the action made by the community may not interest young people can affect their involvement . howeve , they should have a look at it when living in community .
