i clearly disagree with the statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . the only constant thing in this world is `` change '' . things are changing from the way they used to be before . man is also changing . the phase of his life , when he used to find it difficult to earn his daily bread ha almost come to an end . the living condition have been improving . man is able to earn enough to support his , a well a , his family need . man ha become a very busy animal with his appointment , meeting , business and many more issue which demand most of his time , caliber , intellengence and effeciency . he also ha his daily chore which he ha to finish before calling it a day . to keep up with all this he need fast and convinent transport to help him reach his destination on time . car is a convinent mode of transport for him . it is no more a status symbol . it ha become a necessity . it a very common thing , nowadays , to own a car . the advancing technology and the need for fast transportation result in more people owing car . apart from fossil being the primary source of fuel to ignite the engins , new form of energy are also being developed . one among them is , trapping of the solar energy . cars can now be run on solar energy . this eco friendly development is a boon to man . he need not spent mpre money to just fill his car tank with gas . hence , i opine that there will be an increase in the number of car rather than a decrease .
