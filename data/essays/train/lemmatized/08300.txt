this is a difficult topi a both travelling in a group and travelling alone ha it advantage and disadvantage . and the choice also can vary from person to person . in my case i dont agree with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are various reason to support my choice and these are discussed below . firstly in the case of taking tour in a group led by guide , there is time boundness . the tour guide manages the time keeping in mind the whole group . in this case i can not spend much time on the place which i really like . if i am trevelling on my own i can visit the place of my choice . secondly , in the group travel the tour guide generally make the staying arrangement at the place which have better facility . in this case you do not get a chance to interact with the local people . when i am taking a tour i like to know the local culture and talk to the local people. , because i think that is more fun . additionally i like to try the local food if i am going to some new place . this give me a chance to improve my knowledge about that place and the people there . in a guide led tour there are very le chance of doing that . furthermore , i am a spontaneous person by nature . i enjot thing at certain moment . so if i am taking a tour with several other people it will not be possible to do watever i want . and in this case i will not be able to enjoy properly and it will not be fun for me . so in the conclusion i want to say that it actually depends upon the individual whether he like to travel in a group led by tour guide or on his own .
