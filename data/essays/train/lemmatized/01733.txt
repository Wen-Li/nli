in the long run , understanding idea and concept are more important than learning fact becasue understanding main concept let student to adapt constant understanding about new fact in the long period time , and because student can approach to the factor more intuitively and effectively . fisrt , understanding concept will help the student adapt the new factor in the long run . for example , major business principle learnd in school and information from pop-bussiness book ha different value . the principle may not be easy to use in the real word , but they are proven to be valuable in the long preriod while pop-business book usualy hit in very shor time period . one of the papular movement called ` six sigma ' wa thought to be a perfact solution of the future market , but it became a cause of le inovation of company because it based on a particular fact in the short time period and ignored lot of key concept in business principle . second , understanding concept first will be more effective to understand fact . if a group of business student are given lot of raw data such a new paper and statistic without learning basic concept , then they will not be able to understand what the data actually mean and their misunderstanding can be greater . this type of learning will be a lot slower than understanding main concept first . in conclution , i believe that understanding concept first is better in the long run , because it will let student adapt to various problem , and the student will be able to learn more effectively in the limited time .
