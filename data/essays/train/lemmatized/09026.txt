i disagree with this statement . this statement is n't true for all young people . in my church community there are many young people beside me who enjoy helping . i have been being a scout leader for four year . i give my free time to care for child , to think about game which i can play with them and to help them if there is any problem . i dont get any money for this , i do this because i like it and have fun almost always . of course there are situation where i am nerved and tired of entertaining child , but all bad emotion vanishes if you could make these kid happy . so it depends on the education and the surrounding of a young peolpe wether he ( or she ) is willing to help his ( or her ) community . not all peolpe have this social ambition that i have . i can imagine there are people who only want e.g. to get a high paid job or to be the best in the class etc . they want to obtain their goal without careing for other people . but i think that there were always such people who dont care . when i read this statment , i wonder what enough mean . who determindes what or how much help is enough ? i think there is n't a right answer . everyone should find out for theirselves what time to help they would like to spend . considering job which are paid there are other point . all men who dont want to go to the army have to do social work for one year . they have to care for disabled human or very poor people . my brother ha to do this at the moment and he doe his job at the social meeting point of the main railway station . he tell me about the different kind of people and life he wa get to know . i think he is doing enough for the community and his work is n't easy . in my opinion people who have never done a piece of social work indepent from the kind of work missed some important , character-forming and great experience .
