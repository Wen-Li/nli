is a fact more important than to understand idea and concept ? the answer to this question is not easy at all . for some , a student is better educated if he know a great number of fact . for others it is better to know the idea and concept , for this knowledge allows you to create your own fact . this essay will analyze that idea and concept are more important than fact alone . facts , are information that allows a person to solve a situation or problem . they are answer to question . for example , we know now that environmental warming today is causing the north pole to melt , that 's a fact . but how did we get to that fact ? that 's why fact alone should not be the most important educational element for student . in order to create our own fact or understand how information ha been created we need to understand idea and concept . in connection to the above , idea an concept are important for they let u acquire knowledge of fact by ourselves . for example , if a student get trained in advanced math , he will possibly be able to create his own math theory . in other word he will be able to create or explain fact . this evidently conforms a better education for a student . in conclusion , idea and concept are more important and have more educational value . a student that know fact will not have the ability of one that understands idea and concept . in this sense my personal opinion ha been proved . it is better knowing how to create fact than getting the answer from a book .
