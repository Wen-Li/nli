i disagree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i think that using well one specipic subject is useful . we develop one subject . studies make many knowledge . so one subject is we become deep studing . various thinking become knowledge . but , if we have broad knowledge of many academic subject , we will make nomal student . we have only information . one special subject is that student make thinking . also , it is important .
