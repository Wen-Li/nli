i certainly agree with the stament . all the famous people or the people who became self made men , tried new thing taking their risk . it is very hard being a succesfull people doing only what you already know how to do well . all the tycoons in the world like bill gates , rupert murdoch or the italian silvio berlusconi began succesfull people discovering new way of busisness or taking big risk in investiments of money . this is the only way to become an important person in the busisnes 's world . another reason to support this thesis is on the fact that is quite harder to being a successful man in a busisness field where there is lot of competition . so is much easier , once you have found an idea , to make money in a new field of the busisness world . because at the beginning you do not have any competitor and you could create a `` monopolio '' that give you the possibility to earn a lot money . for istance the richest person in the world , bill gates , had became himself by discovering and inventing a new kind of busisness that before him wa n't operating , or it wa operating but wa not that famous . he took a lot of risk at the beginning starting this new business but now he is the most rich in all the world , so we can say that he had a brilliant idea . another reason is t that the successful people who take risk usually have very determinated character , that certainly help in the challenge . and people who win challenge often became successful in their own field . and last but not least there is a proverb that explain in few word exactly the reason of why i agree with the statement . and the proverbn say : `` no pain no gain '' .
