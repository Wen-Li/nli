i agree with the statement . because i think young people can do many thing than older people . for example , one of my experience . it wa when i went to india . in india , we need a lot of power to walk , wating for vehicle , and so on . there are no official standard of the cost , so we always have to discus with the driver or selles . i felt they ware very stressful . because of these reason , i think they need a lot of physical power . it is pretty difficult for older people to travel to india . it is a special case , but i think it is adjust not only in india , most of other country . second , last year my father broke his leg and he became not to be able to run fast . he ha many hobby , like golf , climbing mountain , and playing sport and so on . but now he can not almost of them . the doctor said to him that the reason he broke his leg is that he moved too much despite of his age . these day , he always say to me that i had better do various thing while you are young . now , he cant . of course , there are some thing older people can do too . but while , there are a lot of thing they can not do either . and they are going to increase . because of these reason , i agree with the statement .
