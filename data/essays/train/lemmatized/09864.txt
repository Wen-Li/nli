the world is big and there are lot of thing that we are not aware of what happens around . most of u go to the collage and try to be best in our depatments and graduate with the high mark . but i thing we miss someting when we really focus an what we are doing . i think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject instead of working on a specific one . i am a biologist . i have graduated from the universtiy 3 month ago . i am very hard-working and ambitious student . i always wanted to be best and get high mark from the exam . i think i achieved this . but sometimes i think that whether it wa good or not to be ambition like me . when i look those day i thing that i wish i wa not so ambition . i could have thougt that there were many thing in the world more then exam and schol . life is not worth living wihout noticing event that happen around you and also what wa happened in the past . why i say this ? past . one of my hobby is reading about history . i would really concerned about how people were living in the past . their culture , custom , behavior to each other and differenced between generation . because i belive that this is a chain . what we do today will be related to the past . those are our ancestor and we are the hiers . every one should know something about their country ' s history . i realized that time it is never to late to do something . i hope i will attend my education in biology because it wa my dream . i will continue to my research in one of the tecnical university in my country about the medical plant ana tissue culture . and i hope to go abroad with my research . but this time i will not adopt myself only my working . i will create time to read much more about the news around world , politics , also art and history . i will educate myself every kind of subject .
