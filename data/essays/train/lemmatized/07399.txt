to understand idea and concept or to learn fact always is a important question when teacher or parent educated child . it is a chicken-egg question , i think . but i prefer to let student to learn fact at first . facts are the real reflection of the idea and concept . it is the real item , visual image , or true thing happens in everyday live . we can catch it around u , we can feel it beside u , we can heard it from surrounding evironment . it doe not like the imagination of idea and concept ; it is the real version of idea and concept . how do the idea and concept come from and where do they come from ? this is the relationship between idea and fact . most idea come from the thinking and studying of fact . from this point , we can state : fact are the mother of idea and concept . if everyone just thinking everyday , and nobody come to the real world and make these idea come true , what will our world become ? also , fact will help u to understand idea and concept deeper and stronger . for instance , many people have taken chemistry , biology , or other science course during high school . teachers always let student to do differetn laboratry when studying a new subject . the different lab and the observation of these activity are the fact . most teacher want student to understand the idea or concept that they tell student more impressive . the visual item or truth can help people memorize and understand more effectively . as i studying different subject , i usually prefer to know the fact of them . after that , i can see the real reflection of it and figure out how to reinforce the deep thinking that hide back of the topic . although idea and concept are the basic of almost fact , to see the item related to our real life is more useful for me .
