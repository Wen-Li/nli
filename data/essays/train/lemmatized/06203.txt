a cheetah can run 170 miles/h when it young and slows down when get older and would rather chase already dieing pray or not even bother for it if he can get his hand on a weaker predator . as far a this saying go it is appropriate to state that young people can tend to enjoy a lot more then older people . life is becoming fast everyday and grows faster by the hour and the faster it get the more people tend to release out their stress and thus end up enjoying the moment rather then wondering what will happen if they do bad at their job and they turn worse in an interview or even fail at an exam they have preparing for month . by the time it all happens and everything tends to come through we all realise oh ! my god ! i wasted so much time planning tommorow and look i have become old and useless . why not leave everything aside and live today . as the genration ha passed people thinking ha evolved with more night club opening and party held through out the year the new generation ha learned to live through the stress rather then live with it . people who are old and who have not evolved with the time tend to stay in their own little space and move out a little and talk about old time that they had. , missing on the fact the time is now and else is long gone . my friend ha a grand father whom i respect very much , but then he still life in the old time and telling u what happened century ago and that we should discus matter that we have no knowledge of what so ever . while on the other hand if their is an occasion all the benevolent people get together to party while everybody tell u to study . its not that we do n't study , we do it when it needed and no compromise with the enjoyment that we have now cuz this will all become a memory in course of time so live it through all , while we all can . eat the cake before the friend get home or there will be none left to taste and you will know that wa probably the best cake ever made . people before u beleived in letting others taste we can enjoy it later and it probably use ripe without anybody even trying it . time waits for no one no matter how hard you try live it all . ............
