i completely agree with statment that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there can be exception but in general younger people are tend to enjoy more on account of their high energy level and will to live life to it 's fullest . younger people are more energetic , fit , enthusastic , experimental , sporty in nature and more excited towards event of life they are facing or they are going to face . on the other hand older people are compratively not much enthusiastic because of ill fitness , lack of energy , lack of will to do thing . fed up from their problem . they do not prefer experimentation or adventure . when i wa of age 6 i always wanted my grandfather to run with me , run my bicycle . he used to refuse and he used to see my enjoyment by riding bicycle . i used wonder why he is not being part my happiness my enjoyment . but later i realised i grew up that he wa heart patient and could not afford to run and enjoy like i did . age , disease made him weaker and he wa refused to do even simple thing that he wished to enjoy . younge people can do whatever they wish and this is treasure of happiness . if one wish to climb the hill one need to think about it . but this is n't case when it come to older people . energy , fitness anr not the only thing . willpower is lacking in older people . i had one professor who used to teach me langauge calles `` sanskrit '' . he wa always in demand to give lecture , teaching student . but now he is 88 and `` sanskrit '' is something he sepnt his life for . he is very fit for his age . but still he is not able to teach student and give lecture even at renowed university because he do not have that same willpower . he can ot enjoy something he did for his whole life . younge people on contrary can go and party late , they can play , they can race , they can climb mountain . they have willpower to acheive something in life . they can try their level best with energy and will and can enjoy their success . youngsters have broader vies towards society so they can enojoy what they get without any conflict . i know my borther who party every night , go on trekking every alternate sunday , get good mark , get success out of whatever he want to do . but in same home he life , his grandmother can not enjoy beyond going to temple and to meet some relative . also younger people can take defeat is something which will make them emotionally strong while older take is a failure . that take the enjoying of winning away from them . confidence , will , energy these are key point of happiness . and unfortunately olders don not have them compared to younge people . so i think youngster enjoy life more than olders do .
