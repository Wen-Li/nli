i 'm totally agree with this statement . this is a problem which is always more frequent in the last time . this is for differents reason : the first is that today the advertisement are much common then before . we can see and hear it everywhere , not only by the normal medium which the television or the radio . looking a sport match , or simply taking a walk on a street we will notice that the numbes of advertisments is visible increased . and if there are always more pubblicity , the corporation who made the advertisement are in a strong competion with the others corporation who made the advertisement for a similar product . this competition are the main reason who move a corporation to tell lie about his own product . in this way they want to convince the acquirent to buy a product who should be positively different by an other from a different corporation . the one who could trying to stop this process are the customer . in the last fifteen year several customer association are born to to contrast every form of unreal illegal advertisement .
