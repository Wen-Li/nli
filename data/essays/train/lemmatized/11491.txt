some people may think that the older people enjoy life more than young people do . however in my opinion , young people enjoy life more than older people do because most of young people have a motivate to live and meet various people and hanging out with them make life more pleasant . young people have a dream . i believe that it is really great to have a goal in our life . young people 's dream are all different because of their fasinate desire such a ideal entertainer , parent , sportsman , doctor , and artist . without this dream , young people may live like a ` dead collapse ' . for example , my friend longs to be a famous singer . therefore she practice her sing for more than 7 hour per day . she doe not want to give up her dream because she love to spend her time to singing . she said when she practice the sing she feel like she is heaven . i do not think that older people do not have a goal any more because they already achieved it and their rapid life will make them to live in boredom . by meeting new people give young people an enjoyable life . everyday we approach new people . it is really fun to meet them who have all different characteristic , and appearance . when we meet someone who can reliable and want to be a companion to our life then we called it `` pursuit of happiness '' . for instantce , when i hang out with all my friend , i forget depression and lost stress . some time we spent our time to watching movie , and chilling about our daily life . even though we feel irritation because of our consistant boring life , it will be fine if we have a true friend . at this time , i think i am not afraid of anything because always my friend being on my side . in my conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older people do because we have a dream where we can motivate ourselves , and hanging out with friend more often without any worry . i am really happy to be part of young people ! .
