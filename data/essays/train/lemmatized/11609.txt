many people travel alone or get a help from a guide . i like to say that if we travel by travel guide , then we can not go to the place that we want to go . if we use the service , we have to follow the schedule of tourist . i believe that the tour that are led by guide is more expensive than the touring alone . so i strongly disagree that we had better travel certain place by alone rather than traveling by traveling in a group . first , if we travel by travel guide , we can not go the the place that we want . suppose you want to visit to the place that ha a arcade and fun stuff . but the travel guide already planned to go to the temple or mountain . you might do n't want to go those place . according to the idea , you have to go to the place that 's proper to your interest or hobby . you can not fit your interest into the tourist schedule . second , traveling alone is going to be more cheap than traveling in a group . the guide company might charge extra money for the service . because of that , you might spend more money from a tour that is not in your interest . so i would say that you definitely going to save money and get to the place that you want to go by traveling alone . in conclution , i discussed about traveling . on that topic i disagreed with the fact that we should travel in a group led by a tour guide . but traveling by tour guide would be not fun , it 's depends on your interest . the place that go should be decided by your interest . and it is very hard to match your interest with tourist schedule . and traveling by traval guide would cost you more than traveling alone . you can save a lot of money from that . because of those opinion i strongly disagree with traveling ina group led by a tour guide .
