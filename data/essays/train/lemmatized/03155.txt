there is an arguement concerning whether it is beneficial for people to have broad knowledge of many field or to specialize in one particular subject . although it is true that one specific knowledge can be more efficient , i believe that broad knowledge ha many advantage . in this essay , i will briefly two reason supporting my idea . most of all , people who have broad knowledge of many academic subject can study their own field . in particular , in the science research , scientist who have a variety of knowledge can be obtain idea about his research from different subject . for example , i read an article of one physicist whom i do not remember his name . he said that he often gain his idea about physic research from literature . besides , the paradigm of subject are shifted in 21st centry . in 21th centry , many subject are combined with other subject which are not related them . for instance , physicist can adjust his knowledge to the medical science or biology , and economist can use scientific method to analize economic material . in this respect , knowing many academic subject have many benefit to study . moreover , having broad knowledge can make life more plentiful . particularly , person who have many academic subject can talk and discus with people who have different job or major . therefore , he can enjoy various kind of subject and make friend who is in different field . this make his life more exciting and plentiful . besides , people who have different subject with their major can applicate this knowledge his level of living better . for example , my uncle is professor of biology but he also know well about economy . he adjust his knowledge about economy to invest stock , and he earn mucy money . in conclusion , having a wide range of knowledge is better on account of reason that i mentioned above : various knowledge can contribute to not only the reseach and study in many field , but also make more plentiful life .
