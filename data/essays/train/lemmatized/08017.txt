althoug there are still many young people who are very engaged in their commmunities , i agree that in general they do n't provide enough help . especially by observing the intense need for help in many community because of le support from the government it is clear to me that there should be much more young people engaging themselves in their community . nevertheless , i have the strong impression that the interest in social activity ha decreased among young people . this ha three basic reason . first , i am convinced that the decrease of importance of religion in the modern society ha caused a more egoistic approach in life of young people . since there is le religious education , providing moral value , the emphasis is put on personal succes but not on helping others . thus , it appears that helping the community for many young people is a minor goal in live than egoistic aim . therefore there are le young people who are helping their community by taking part in social work of the church . furthermore , young people are also le interrested in politics . threfore the young people spend their time with other thing like personal amusement and do not try to realise their political and social view in their community . for example in the generation of my parent there were regular political debate in their town , where also young people made proposal for social project and also participated in such action to realise their political aim . lastly , i believe that live in big city prevents young people of helping there community . although there is a lot of social work to do especially in big city , only a few young people are trying to improve the situation because they probably feel anonymous in big city and can not identify with socially weaker people . apart from that there is also a lack of group feeling in big city . consequently the young people do not experience life a living in a community and are therefore le motivated to offer their help .
