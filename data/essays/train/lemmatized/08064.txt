cars transportations are very important in people 's life . they provide easy way for people to travel from one place to another . there are many automobile and in my opinion , i guess car are the most important automobile . cars are very important in one 's life for many reason . first , they are easy to use , everyone can use them . second , they are not expensive , maybe some of them but if one want to buy a car for a certain purpose , for example to go from one place to another , he/she can buy a small car according to his budget . third , car are designed , nowadays , in many shape and for many occasion , so anyone can find a car that is suitable for a certain purpose . for example , if one want to go to a place that is a little bit far from his home and he/she need to spend the night driving , he/she can buy the car that is suitable for this occasion , like car that are big and have a chair at the back that open when he/she want to have rest . so , the main point i want to explain is that car are designed in many shape and many size that are suitable for many different occassions . well , inspite of their disadvantage , such a air pollution , traffic and accident , i guess car are more useful than other automobile , like bus or train or even plane . let me put this in another way , if one want to go to work and he/she want to take the bus , first he/she must wait for the bus to arrive , and when the bus arrives he/she must check if the bus is full or not and after taking the bus and arriving to work , he/she will pay for the ride which annoy most of the people . so , i think , instead of paying everytime he/she can buy a car ! so , i guess , car are smaller , more useful , more helpful and cheaper than any other automobile the core of this is that i totally disagree with the statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . i think in twenty year people will be fewer than car .
