i agree with this statement , i think indeed that in general successful poeple are more likely enklined to get into new and maybe more risky situation ( financially or personaly ) when poeple have reached a honorable level of social success , they tempt to be much more self confident and by that le subject to being afraid of taking risk . most of the time the risk are taken financialy . but those are n't most of the time uncalculated ; they are done in a way that they will not be totaly in danger . for example : if it 's a financial risk , they will probably mesure the level of danger in so far that even if it take a negative turn , they will be able to handle it .
