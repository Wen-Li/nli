we are now in a youth community , all the benifits are given to the young people first then the sinior citizen . i agree that young people nowadys do not give enough time to helping their community . nowadays , the young generation do n't really involved in all this politics , social issue that occured in their country or state . firstly , i would like to say that our young people are not encouraged by their friend , family , or society . besides that , the education are not really emphazing it a a very important issue to help the community . young people are all ver in this new era , young people will be occupied by all the new entertainment . our country are getting high tech , everything is so convenience . for example , online shopping , we are able to purchase anything we want just with a click . with this , the interaction between people and people is getting le and le . this is a very competitive world , everyone want to get the best for themselves . they want the best job , best car , best house , and etc . so , everyone is trying their best to get what they want , they wo n't think of others , but only think of how to bettle with others to prove that they are the best . my conclusion is that young people nowadys are very self centred , they only care for themselves but not for other people around them .
