today , the number of car boght every year is staggering and the number keep increasingyear on year . however , i believe that the number of car ha peaked and will definitely reduce in the near future . one of the major reason for decline in the car would be the affordibility . with ever rising oil price and declinng reserve , it would be hard for many to own and run a car . although alternative fuel like solar and alchohol car have been suggested they are still far from feasible . these technology would take atelast two decade in implementing and can not offer any immediate solution . also there is lot of concern for pollution and traffic caused by the large number of car on our street . green activist are calling for special tax on car for polluting the environment . this forced goverments to enforce tax on the car manufacturing company . this would certainly reduce the interest of new car manufacturer . public transport facility like bus and metro will gain wide acceptance not only because thay are much cheaper . but also because of the advancement in the technology , government and other organization are able to provide commuter with comfort which are on par with the one that car provide . twenty year later there would be further improvement in the commuting technology which would lead to reduced car user . lastly , there are technology like segway and personal flying plane that are in prototype stage of testing . these invention could replace the car in the near future . in sum i believe that car would be replaced by other form of transport both for economical and environmetal issue .
