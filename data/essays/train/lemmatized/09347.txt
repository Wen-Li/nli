in general , i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact . however , i am not convinced that it is not neccessary to learn fact also . on one hand , it is very important for student to understand the basic idea of different phenomenon . with this it will be much easier to learn new thing and solve problem much more effective . the needed fact one can review later in a lot of book . on the other hand , for solving a problem one will need always a lot of fact and while working in a company , one will be always under time pressure . therefore an employee with a lack of already known solution , will need much more time for solving a given problem , while spending time in reading book . moreover it is possible that he will find an already known answer for the task . for example , when one have to invent something new , the first point is always a patent research . mostly one will find a already known proper solution . as a scientific assistent at the faculty of mechanical engineering i met many time problem while researching on a specific topic . my experience are , that in 98 percent i can solve these problem only with the actual state of the art and only in 2 percent i need to invent something new . moreover i wrote a lot of exam in which i had known all basic , but , i wa not able to calculate a giving machine , a i had not known specific fact . according to this , i am advising the student in my class of thermodynamic to have an careful look to the different process given a an example in the book . when they will write the examen at the end of the semester , it is possible that one of this process have to been calculated .
