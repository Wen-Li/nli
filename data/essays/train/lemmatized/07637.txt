yes the above statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . because if the person is already successed in doing one thing then he will definitely take risk in doing the new thing rather than doing the old thing which is already been successed . after the one success he should try the new thing and must take risk otherwise he or she will not get success in future . for example if a person developed a computer software and got successed in his software then the person take risk and develop a new software which is more usefull than the previous one and take it a a challanging task . and suppose for the best example take `` microsoft '' comapy which developed microsoft disk operating system that is ms-dos and after it 's succession then developed later edition a windows-95 and later came window - 98 , 2000 , me , xp . and after all of them are successed the company developed anew and latest operating system that is window vista which is the latest of all computer operating system . which is now competing with machintosh operating system of apple computer owened by `` steve job '' .so if the microsoft havent take the risk of developing window vista after the succession of windows-xp then now we might not using the windows-vista , definitely not . the reason behind taking risk are the successful people who is already successed are very good in the society and they cant be fixed to their success so they will try new thing and even take risk for their new success . another example is that if a business man running super market if it get successed then that person will invest his profit to keep another branch in the same city by taking risk rather than looking at the already successed super market . and also he try to develop the other branch to earn profit like the other do . so , finally i agree with the above statement that successful person take risk and find new thing .
