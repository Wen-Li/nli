in the era of fast developing technology , enjoying life is becoming goal of life . in my opinion , the young people enjoy life more than older people do . firstly , the older people have no enough time and spirit to enjoy their life . in the competective society , the older people concentrate their attention on how to find a good job and so on , so their time and spirit is exhausted and even they want to enjoy life entirely it is not permitted by themselves . in the contrast , that young people reletively have more time than older people make them easier to enjoy life . when the older people are busy to work , maybe the young people are watching movie or even traveling abroad . secondly , the young people meet a myriad of newly developed entertainment such a electric game and internet . as the developing of technology , it appears a lot of thing that older people never met . so if a older person have a cd-rom of a new game or chat on the internet , maybe he will not know what to do because in the time he is young he had never seen these thing . but the environment where the young people live form them a broad accept ability to something completely new . it is the young people who compete in the world cyber games competetion , it is also the young people who chat on the internet and play net game . so to the summary , young people enjoy life more than older people not only because they have enough time and spirit but they also meet and accept some new way of enjoying life . but this group of people may be older one day , so i think they should be more interested in enjoy life rather than geting tired a a older person .
