the statement is that `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . i agree with this above statement that is `` more important the idea and the concept to a student '' . because if we have some imagination then we will imagine and we will try to reach that imagine . if we doe n't have any imagination then there is no way to reach some purticular state . so the imagination is the important thing for the student because using with the alredy developed thing they will try to do new thing . like that they can know each and every point where they face the problem and some achievement in there experiment . so the concept also take main role in the student life . if they have good knowledge in the concept then only he will learn something new otherwise he will not get good knowledge . if the student want gain more knowledge then it better to learn understand the idea of that field and understand the concept of that perticulal field . if the student have good basic then they can easily analyse the new thing very easily . and the student can capable to invent new thing . if every student start with some basic and concept then it is easy to learn and with this student experience they try to dis cover some more new thing in the future . the the next generation also try to learn the basic and the idea from the elder or teacher . and they will implement furtherly . if the student learn fact then they will not sharpen their mind a well a they dont try to analyse that why that fact is made . so this is the main disadvatage to a student to learn something new .
