there are two different aspect which make the question difficult to answer if it is better to have broad knowledge or to specialize in one specitic subject . at first if you study undergraduate it is neccesary to get a lot of information from diffrent academic subject . because you do not know anything about that subject you study and so you have to lern a lot . you have to learn practical thing like how to prepare an essay or how do i have to work out my letter for the proffesors or maybe how can i regestrade me in the system at the university . also you have to learn a lot of stuff to get the ability to talk with someone around your topic . it is necessary to know the topic . i will give an example if you are studying architecture you have to know how to build a house if you do not know this it make no sence to learn other thing like interior design . so if you do not kmow basic you can not go on futher . therfore i found it very importent to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . second if you are a graduate student who know the pasics he can consentrade on speciffic subject . maybe for interrior design or special concrets . in the upper class i would say you have to specifies your topic . however at the end i have to say that it give no genuraly answer on this question . it depense on you life situation .
