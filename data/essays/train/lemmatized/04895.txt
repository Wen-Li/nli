i think le and le young people nowadays take time to help their community is true , but i do n't think the reason is because they do n't have enough time to help the community . if you take time to go to some campus to take a look at , you will figure out what do our yang generation do after class . more and more coffee shop , restaurant were opened , yang people drink and eat whole the day , from sunday to monday , from day to night . it seems they rather than take time doing nothing , but not willing to do something for those people they might need to help . i do n't know what 's wrong with our education system , however , it 's really bad because most of our yang generation are so unconsiderable for everything .
