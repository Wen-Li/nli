some people think hat in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , while others do n't have this point of view , and i agree with the latter for three reason : variety of function of the car , difficulty to reach a lot of place , and amusement of driving . first of all people use car for a lot of purpose : for example the drive their own car to go to work , to reach big store , to meet friend , and to enjoy theirselves . as a result they need a trasportation service and in my opinion they prefer a car because it is more confortable than bus and train . in fact people do n't like to stay very close to others , like they have to do in a bus or a plane ; on the other hand they feel more comfortable inside their car , where they can stay alone or with few other person . next , there are a lot of place that can be reached only by car , for instance big store that are very far from city . also supermarket , sport and medical center , theatre and shop can be very far . therefore , it is necessary to own or rent a car in order to go these place . finally people usually think that driving a car is very funny : for examle there are a lot of people who drive not only in order to reach a specifical place , but also to enjoy theirselves . they think that driving a car is pleasant and they can have relax when they are going by car . in addition they are very interested in car brand , like bmw and mercedes , and this prof thay the statement is no torue
