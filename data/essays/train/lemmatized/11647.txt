first i would measure that i agree with tihs statement . a great number of advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i would give two example to explain my opinion : a good example you can find in politics . next to an election the politician show their programm and everyone of them emphasize that his programm is the best and solve all of the problem the nation ha . it 's like a competition . the advertisement visualize the programms , send some television spot and organize big public event to present the candidats of the election . but when the election is over most time the winner ca n't solve the problem . the national economy do n't grow up and there will be not creating a new street through the town . the people will experience that all that big competition wa a fake . an other example are television spot for a kind of product , for example furniture , car , food , and so on . when the producer make the television spot they use big light and there are people in the spot who look very good . the purpose is , that they would take the product in a `` goog light '' . food appears very healthy and the car is blinking in the spot . the consumer see that spot and is really exited to buy this product . i can say this about my behaviour , too . last week , for example , i saw a spot about a new coffee taste . the next day i 've run to the supermarket and i 've looked about the product . in front off i see that the coffee cinsists sugar and that you have to put it in water to drink it . thus i realised that the advertisement had done the best to make the product seem much better than it really is . in assumption i can say that we have to really pay caution every day , that we do n't are
