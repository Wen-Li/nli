advertisments are driving the market . in nowadays world , the best company are esily recongnisible from their advertisments . all the great company have a fantastic advertisment campaign in order to promote their product/s . on this direction , all the new emergents business are working on creating fantastic advertisments to break into the market and obtaining a huge amount of counsumers ready to consume teir product/service . the only problem is that these new company are focusing so much on the advertisement that they stop to take care of the quality of the product . for these reason we have on the market there well made advertisments promoting a product that is not so good . it is true that the most important point of an advertisment is to give to the customer a sensation of a dream . companies want to convince customer that their product/service is the best on the market , but consumer , if are not satisfied in the product that they bought , they will never buy that product again . from a sourvey that i road in the economist , i discovered that the dissatisfaction in customer ha incresed of 40 % these last twenty year . the responsable is probably this new trend of exagiring the product/service quality to much by advertisments . for example , i remembered when i bought a pair of tennis shoe from a new sport cloathing company called ttk . i have been attracted to this pair of shoe from the desines enphasize on a billboard with a slogan on the buttom that wa saying `` ttk . .. the shoe of the warrior . .. '' . there wa also written under the slogan that they were one of the most resisten shoe on the market . after that i bought these shoe , i succed to play tennis just ten time : they were already completely destroyed ! i believe that if company will not change the way of advertising , consumer will not trust them anymore , and also the big corprations will have a decrease in the sale .
