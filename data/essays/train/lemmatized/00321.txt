advertising is a major category and a fast-growing trade in today 's world . it is a wide field that ha managed to gain control of how we view everything around u , from politics to grocery . we see advertisement everywhere ; on television , in magazine , in newspaper , on the street , we even listen to them on the radio . adveritising ha become a field of competition between company , each company trying to present it product in a perfect picture to the consumer . but is that product really a good a the commercial claim it to be ? i agree with the statement , that most advertisement ( if not all ) make product seem much better than they really are . for i have been a victim of such false commercial repeatedly . i recall buying an expensive shampoo upon seeing it advertisement that promised and guaranteed longer hair in one month . of course , i did n't notice any difference to my hair growth rate , even after two month of usage . i wonder why most company ca n't release a product they are confident enough about , so they would n't need to add misleading information to their commercial . i do n't think it 's fair to the consumer ( or to the consumer 's pocket ) to be fooled into buying something that doe n't match the description he/she had in mind . i think product should be professionally compared to their commercial before viewing them in the medium . that would , no doubt , decrease such misguiding advertisement . but i guess that , over the year , one gather experience , and eventually know what to believe and what not to .
