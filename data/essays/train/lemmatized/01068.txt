i do n't agree with the statement . i think in twenty year there will be more car than today . my opinion is based on the following reason . first , the car are the most individual transportation tool . they give people the freedom to choose when to leave and where to go and can make the journey more convinient . as the society develops , pressure will increase and we are more and more likely to search for the freedom in our life . cars are a good choice . although more car will result in traffic jam in city , people are building the cross bridge to solve the problem . second , many people may argue that the waste gas from the car are one of the major reason that pollute air . however , scientist now have developed many kind of car that use clean energy such a the energy from the sun and so on . these kind of car are in use in some country by some people . moreover , scientist and manufacturer are trying their best to put these new car into market , aiming that these car will be affordable for the public . at the same time , scientist are also doing great effort to improve the speed of the these new car . and i believe in a near future , these new car using clean energy source , will be a fast a the car nowadays . also , i think the clean energy will also be used in the car today , which will greatly decrease the pollution made now . as a result , the major obstacle that prevent car using will be removed . third , a the economy of the world develops , the price of car will go down , a well a the new car . meanwhile the ability of people to buy car will increase . more people in the developed country will own car . each family or person will own more car . further , more people in the developing or le developed country will buy car . for example , in china only a few people have car , and a the ability of consumption advance , more and more people are planning to buy car . and i think in the near future , there will more car than now will be seen in the road of china . in conclusion , i think the number of the car will increase , because car can give every one a feeling of freedom , and a many problem caused by car can be solved and the more and more people are able to afford a car , we are willing to buy this kind of freedom of our life .
