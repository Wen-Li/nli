yes , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than specialisze in one specific subject because of various reason . if a person ha knowledge about a particular subject , it is good . but if he want to refrain himself from foraying from other subject he should make sure that he is very thorough with that subject . because finally he should find a job on that basis only and more ver all the academic topic are interconnected so , it imperative to have knowledgein various field . the above option would be good only if he find a job . he should always keep in mind the different possibility in hi carreer . he should ask himself `` what if i dont get a job in his desired field of study ? '' for example i am a mechanical engineering student . a every one know there is a scarcity of job for mechanical engineer . if i continue with the same field would be left unemployed . here i need to have an alternate option . i have my alternate option a computer science . i started learning some computer subject . now even if i donot get a job in my field of study , i may have a chance of getting it in field of computer . this would not leave me unemployed . i personally feel that being employed is better than being unemployed . this criterion not ony work for two field of same backround , it also work for a technical background and an art background . for example , an electrical engineer who doesnot have a job and whose hobby is singing , can survive by giving some stage show . which would also be considered a an employment . moreover , broader knowlege would not leave you speechless when you are in a group . because when agroup is discussing a topic and if you are silent , you may feel embarassed with that . but if you are familiar with the topic you can also give your opinion on the topic . this is possible only if you donat confine yourself to a particular field i conclude that having a broad knowledge is better than to specialize in one subject .
