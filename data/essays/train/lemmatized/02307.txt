i believe that is better to have a strong knowledge about a specific subject , rather than a superficial and wide one of lot of academic theme . i 'm going to explain my reason using a personal example : my academic choice . in italy there are two type of universities : - one type is for the student that have a clear idea of what they want to do in their life . if you study medicine , that mean that you want to become a doctor ; if you study law , it mean that you want to become a lawyer ; - the other is for the people who doe n't know exactly , or at all , what to do . for example , science of communication give you broad knowledge about many subject : literature , psychology , business , art etc ... , but doe n't prepare you for anything in particular . i chose to study public relations , which is very similar to science of communication , because i did n't know exacly what i wanted to become . well , at the end of my carreer , after my graduation i asked myself : '' and now ? '' i realized that having lot of knowledge about nothing is absolutely useless . i had many interviewed , but i did n't exacly know what i wanted from that job . the truth is that i did n't know anything specific . this is why i decided to force me to understand what i really wanted to do , and , once i realized that i wanted to work in events , i applied for a master , that would 've gave me all the knowledge and the competence i needed to face the real world . i think that all the high school should help more the student to understand which is the best job for them , not to make the mistake that lot of people do : attending a university random , that give general knowledge , but nothing concrete .
