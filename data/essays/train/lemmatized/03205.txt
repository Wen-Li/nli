i agree with this oppinion . the car will reduce hugely in amount in the future , though it might not dissapear completely . here are the reason why i am so sure about this . first , a people are highly alarmed about the seriousness of the environment polution thesedays , they now tend to use public vehicle such a bus and subway . many people may rebut this point , mentioning non-pollutive car that will show up in the future . of course , there had been a discussion about the replacement about the high-pollutive car before . the theory of a car moving by the power of air wa consideres a few year ago , but it soon got dismissed for the ineffectiveness and it waste of energy . second , due to the developmence of internet , many people have already lost much need of mobility . once they operate the computer and connect the internet , they can be , they can work , they can shop , they can chat with friend , they can take class , they can do anything they do in the real life outside . as the internet system develop more and more , this situation will get much more firm . cars have been a great method for human mobility over a century . but i think it time will be end in very a very short period of time .
