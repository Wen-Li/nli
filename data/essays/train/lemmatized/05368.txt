those day , everybody want to be rich . however , everybody doe not become rich , so we can have a guestion which is `` why people do not become rich people '' . because successful people already know to do well . therefore i agree with sueccessful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . first of all , the successful people have a lot of experioues . when somebody spent a lot of power , time and attempt , the some - body become the rich guy . second of all , when we try something and solve risk , we need money to do something . nowday money can make aother money . for example , my father invested something 5 year ago , but the inventhing wa not famous because , at that time , my father did not ha money . my father tried to make famous , it wa fail . however , when my father had a lot of money , my could make a famous product and than he wa able to make a lot of money . in brief , successful people try new thing and make money e
