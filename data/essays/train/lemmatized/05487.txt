on a first glance it may sound politically correct to say that it is better to have a broader perspective on many subject rather than specializing in a field . but i feel that it is better to specialize in a field , though a field that interest the person to a great extent . in olden day when there wa no technology to aid the human , they accumulated whatever information they had on a particular field . but ultimately the information wa not massive . that is , the information wa not of that quantum that it wa difficult for the brain to remember . lets look at today picture . we know of the advance made in every field of academic . there is so much to learn and know , but is the human brain capable of that ? i dont think so . so it is actually a human shortcoming . now , from another point of view . the most common example of a doctor ! we all know that specialist are an absolute essentiality these day . the reason for an improved life longevity is not only the machine ( i.e. technology ) but also human in the form of specialist . as a specialist know his field very well he can deal with almost all the situation arising from his field and this ultimately mean greater service to the people . although people tend to argue that due to so many branch in every field it might become a case of `` too many cook spoil the broth '' . but , because to the special field , the specialist may concentrate more on his field and and work hard to improve his field of work , that is again , better result ! we have many such example in every field today . for example , had every engineer been building bridge and house ( like earlier ) , would there be field of engineering such a robotics and nano particle ? but , finally a an exception , it must be left to the individual concerned . this is because there is a natural tendency in some people to learn everything they like , they are inquisitive . so it is better to leave the choice to such people . of course , ultimately knowledge is also for pleasure and self contentment ! in conclusion , i would say that the need of the hour is specialist in all walk of life for a better tomorrow .
