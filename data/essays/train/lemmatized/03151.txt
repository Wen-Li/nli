each and every new inniovation in human history started to be used at first with a decreasing manner and then their usage ha becomed more and more wide a they meet the new facility . moreover , people ha made interesting comment on their use among the common people . for instance , one of the owner of a hollywood studio in the first year of the television , he claimed that people would not spend a time in front of a box every night . however , in time it ha become an inevitable element of one house . in fact , there are other several technology that did not take any credit first and , afterwards , they are the important part of our living . one of them , that i would like to discus , is the car that we use everyday for different reason . thus it is not logical to think that they will decrease in use . as the example in our daily life show , their use is constantly increasing due to several reason . today , technology develops regularly and everyday we see different version of the same car , which is supposed to be just a 2 and half tone of iron compounded by four wheel . for instance , there different mark in the market . when it is asked which car you would like to have , there can be various answer to this question ranging from the mercedes to the ford . these new version and mark encourage people to purchase a newer car even if this person ha already one . in addition to that , with the fast developing technology , the automobile are produced more and more cheaper . hence , the people having a little money spent can go and buy a car with respect to his or her budget . indeed , there are consumer credit offered by bank in order to make this process more easier . as far a all these are concerned , it is possible that in the future , the number of car will double instead of diminishing . apart from the technology in producing automobile and the bank credit , the government continously improves the infrasturucture of their country . although their primary concern is to increase the economic transaction wtihin the country and with the other country , this help to individualize the transportation . for instance , in my country , the public transportation is like a torture . the public bus are full of the people both standing and sitting . also , it is not possible to go from one side of the city to other side by taking one bus . moreover , the municipality of the city continously improves the road of the city , rather increasing number of bus and making new combuination of route . consequently , when i see that driving my own car to my destination are relatively better than utilising the bus , i prefer to drive to the place that i wanto to reach . thus , today in my city , there is an increase of car serving for only one person . in conclusion thi
