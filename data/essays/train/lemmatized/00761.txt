i am agree with this statement . people will use traffic transortation such a train or bus or dike or go on foot instead of car a possible a they can . i have two reason . first one is caused environmental issue . now , environmental issue caused car such a global warming is really serious . people have already knew it . gradually , each person will have to having responsibility . people will think the issue more seriously . and people will not use car a lot . second one is the price of gasolin . the price will raise . that is why i agree with the statement .
