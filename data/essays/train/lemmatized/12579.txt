i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . in my view there are some reason thats why i am think the travel with group . first the tour select the the most beautiful place and also most important historical building . the second is the travel with a group is much cheeper than travel alone , with his or her fammily or with couple friend . every thing is much cheep ; airplains ' ticket , hotel , food without your own shopping . and also while you travel with group you can meet some people create a new relationship , in addition you can keep your friend ship after traveling and it will be good memory for your future . the tour give a guide who responsable to explain where tourist travel . he give a some information about the building , museum . a you can learn about the country of history , culture and tradition . if i travel alone i just travel around the city or look the building and skip . or you have to read the book , tourist guide and travel which is not good for me . in every tour there is a free time and you can ask the some interesting place or shopping canter to go , he or she advice to see good place . in conculsion , because all this reason i prefer to travel vith tour . and i believe that it 's more enjoyable .
