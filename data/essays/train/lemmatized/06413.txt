i strongly believe that , its better to have broad knowledge of several acadamic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . the primary reason of this belief is balance that a broad knowledge is student can develop his interrelationship . if we have a only one specific subject we can not speak or argue . why the broad knowledge ? broad knowledge is most important on student aspect because a student ha to know about several subject , because if he go on any where at any seminar or some thing like that they might asked broad knowledge . firstly , broad knowledge is basically know about several topic . we can know information about several subject . the main advantage of several subject knowledge we can participate at any seminar , quiz compititions at any level . we can argue at any topic watever they might ask type of question . and other advantage of broad knowledge is we can give any type ig essay copitions and also compititive exam . and mostly compititive exam need broad knowledge . here im explaing a example , one of my cousin take only art subjest in her course . one day she attended a seminar regarding her art . every one in that seminar wa perfoming there art . after performing an art there conducted a test . but she wa unable to answered for those question because of her one subject knowledge . so , student need many acadamis subject . so finally , im sure that broad knowledge is more helpful for being a good student .
