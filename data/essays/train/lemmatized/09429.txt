while there is a common accepted idea that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way of making a travelling , i am not satisfied by this form of my tour based on my own experience and knowledge . first of all , travelling in a group mean you should adapt yourself to the others in the same group . unfortuately , it is not a rare phenomenom that people can not adjust himself or herself to another person 's habit . a apt evidence to illustrate this is my personal exiperience when i had my trip to yangzi river with a group . i wa totally scared and disrupted by a man in the same group for he always made horable sound while sleeping . and the habit is not the whole story , another thing is you have to adjust your own schedule according to the time table shared among the team , which mean you have little control of your time . moreover , travelling with the guide may suffer the risk of the incompability of the guide . many guide are just graduated from school and lack of adequate experience in order to be a compatable guide in a group . these greenhands might make peccadiloes , flaw or even severe error during their administration of the whole group . a recent study conducted by cnate ( chinese national association of travelling enterprises ) show that about 27 percent of guide are recruit . although the pecentage seems not high , the possibility still exists , and once it happens , it will surly served a a joy-killer . at last , travelling with a group mean the loss of privacy . it is hard to imagine how the privacy can be kept if i have to travel with a group for the whole tour . admittedly , travelling in a group together with a tour guide still ha it own merit . for example , you can enjoy the trip without many consideration such a schedual , fare , to name a few . that is why there are many people have there preference on this kind of travelling . however , i am still inclined to individual travelling . and i am still treasuring a unshakable belief that true satisfaction of travelling can be only found in travelling alone .
