i do not agree with this statement even fi i would like this forcasting wa true . in the next year our city will be crowded with much more car that today . firs of all people really need their car in everything they do especially if they work far form their home . public trasportations are not good enough to make people change their habit . they are always late and dirty , this is because the state doe not invest enough in improving public service . if it take 30 minute to go from home to my office by car and it take 50 minute by train because it is always late i will never change my routine and i will always keep using my car every morning . secondly the increasing number of car in use is also due to the widespread wealth that there is in our city . for instance in italian family there is a mean of 3 car every 2 person . many people buy car not because they need them but because they have a lot of money to spend and so they buy stuff they do not really need . since in many city the wealth is increasing if think that in 20 year we will have much more car than today in our city . this will be a huge problem for the environmental stanpoint , i think that there are two possible solution , the first one is an agressive solution while the second one is a proactive solution aimed at making people collaborate . a first potential solution is to forbid the use of car in downtown during working day so that people would be forced to use public trasportation . a second potential solution could be about investing some money , raised with tax , in improving the efficiency of public trasportations . i think that in this way poeple would decide voluntarly to use subway and train instead of their own car . instead i think that there is no solution concerning the habit of buying too many car compared with need . in conclusion i think that even if some action will be undetaken to reduce the number of car in use , the result will be anyway an increase car in the next year .
