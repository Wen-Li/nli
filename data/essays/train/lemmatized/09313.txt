i agree with the statement that in twenty year car will be fewer in use than today . i agree , because i know that the fossil like oil will be quite rare in the future on earth . because of that , the oilprices will raise up , so that not everybody is rich enough to buy the expencive oil for their car . also , i have the opinion that in the next few year lot of law will found to save the nature and i hope that the people notice that they have to change anything , if they want to live on earth more than twenty year . i guess that more people will use the train or the plain to get to a foreign country for their vacation . because they it will be cheaper than going by car and they are more comfortable . also , i think , that the export from food , clothes and other important thing will be not do by truck . i think that the thing will export by train , ship and plane . my last reason is , that i guess , that people don not need their car anymore because most of the people live in big city or town . in city everything ist close to you , like supermarket , job , school and cinema . so you can do your way by foot and do n't have to use your car .
