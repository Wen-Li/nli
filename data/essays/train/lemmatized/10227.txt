in my opinion , it is true that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . firstly because in today 's society , consumption ha become a way of life where advertisement ha a big impact on consummer 's belief . what is important currently is not necessarily the taste or the quality of a product . the surprising trend is that people are increasingly affected by the image of the product . and the big company have understood this trend and take the opportunity to develop their good by creating solid brand . therefore , they play on the people belief and in some case even cheat on them by arguing with pseudo scientific concept . for instance , we will probably buy the pack of milk with the metion `` special omega 3 '' instead of the one with no advertisement . besides that , we have to be conscious that there is no link between the quality of a product and it advertisement . the proof is that it is a totally different company which is in charge of the advertisement . and this last one ha often much more money to fund it advertisement than the first one ha to make his production . finally i think that it is very dangerous today not to take enough into consideration the way good are producted . some ball are for example made by poor indian child we are not aware of . and they will become high quality ball a soon a a brand will be written on it .
