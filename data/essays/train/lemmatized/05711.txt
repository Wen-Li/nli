i agree with the concept that most advertisement make product seem much better because i experienced the same event . being a consumer , i meet first with the new product in magazine or tv advertisement . if i get attracted to the advertisement , i wish to buy the product . thus , most advertisement exaggerate the good side of the product because the producer want the world to buy them . for example , most advertisement do not mention the side effect of drug even though they can be pretty detrimental . one consumes drug frequently whenever faced with illness . even though it is bad to take the load of them , one take it over and over again until the disease is gone . i am not sure about american advertisement , but in my home advertisement , there is no mention about side effect of the drug . there is not much chance that side effect will appear even 10 percent but i believe it is better to warn the cosumers with those beforehand . the producer do not mention about the side effect because they want their product to be sold . i believe this applies to any other product . thus , advertisment represent the product to be better than the real quality . for another example , advertisement do not show how long clothes or the whiteness of teeth last for . two year ago , i bought a box of `` white strip '' . i did not pay attention to the lasting quality because the advertisement did not mention any of that sort . i tried them for a month and my teeth sure did get whiter but that wa a temporary effect . after a month , my teeth were same a before if not worse . from that time on , i never buy those product again . consequently , the advertisement did not mention that the effect last temporarily because they want consumer to buy the product . another example would be diet coke . advertisement say that diet coke ha le calorie than the original one . if one ha ever drank diet coke , she will notice that it is sweeter than the real one since diet coke use artificial sweetner . according to the research , artificial sweetner ha no calorie but is more harmful than the real sugar if consumed in large quantity . nevertheless , the advertisement doe not mention anything about those information . it is sel-evident that the advertisement give the false impression . in conclusion , advertisement are not to be believed completely because they omit the bad effect or disadvantage of the product . consumers buy the product if they are attracted by the advertisement and that is producer 's trick : representing the better quality of the product to allure the consumer .
