when student study thing which are new to them , student always at first to learn the fact , but what is more important for the student is to understand the idea and concept behind all the fact . first of all , if the student just only learn the fact , it is very easy for them to forget the fact after not long period of time . but if the the student can understand the idea and concept which lie down the fact , they will be easy to memorize most of the fact which they have learned . or the student can also get some useful result themselves from the idea and concept which they totally understand , even if they maybe forget some part of the fact . secondly , it is easier for the student to make application to other area when they grasp the deep idea and concept in one area . for example , the student learn the fact that air will flow from area with higher pressure to area with lower pressure , at the same time if they also understand that the idea and concept of this fact is the theory of air equilization . so they can easily make application to the car or train braking system which are controlled by the high pressure air . last but not least , if the student can understand the idea and concept lying down the fact and they can sometimes also connect this idea and concept with other existing idea and concept , they will maybe make lot of spark on developing new idea and concept which is very useful for all the people . and actually , this is true for how our modern sciene and art develop . poeple always develop new idea from old idea and then applicate them into reality , then the process will make poeple understand our world more and more and make our life more and more splendid . above to all the above , we can see that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn only the fact . this is because understanding the idea and concept not only let them easier remember the fact but also let them easier make application of the idea and concept , even more , it will help student develop more new idea and concept .
