in japan , where i live , many people think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . however , i believe that the best way to travel is in a individual without tour guide for the following reason . most importantly , traveling led by a tour guide is boring because i can not plan the schedule of travel by myself . for example , i traveled europe in individual 7 year ago when i wa a senior of tokyo university . i traveled with mr tamaki who wa my friend of the same tennis club of my university . we traveled around europe for 1 month to germany , italy , switherland , france , and united kingdom . we had not made the schedule fixed before the departure from japan and enjoyed free travel without be bound to schedule . when we went sightseeing of old castle in germany , we became very much favorite of it and stay long time there . however the japanese group led by a tour guide who we met on the castle had to leave there for short time because of fixed scheldule and the look so sorry . i decided that i would never travel with tour guide on that time . second , i can not meet the new people other than the group if i am traveling led by a tour guide . for example , i traveled with thailand with my wife this summer without tour guide . we met a couple from canada who are almost same year old a u at samui of thailand . we got on the same boat to samui and became a very good friend . we are keeping in tough with them after coming back to japan . if i went traveling in a group with tour guide , i can only talk with the member of the group and there are much le oppotunity to meet with people from other country . in conclusion , i prefer traveling in individual without tourguide rather than traveling in a group led by a tour guide .
