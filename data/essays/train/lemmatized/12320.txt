in my opinion i feel that there would not be a many car a there are today . there are several reason to justify my statement . one reason , i feel that in another twenty year or so there would be fewer car is because of the very fact of increase in population growth . for example , in this present situation the popullation of people have increased in billion and traffic ha increased too . this discomfort the people travelling a they spend precious time in traffic jam . hence , many are opting for public transportation a driving your car in the present traffic situation is more of a discomfort than pleasure . secondly , technology is developing to a huge extent and in another twetnty year or so i am sure we would have more convenient transport which is faster , reliable and comfortable would be used . so people do n't have to worry about the traffic jam involved . another reason that i feel that there would be fewer car is because the medium of fuel for car is petrol or diesel and this being a non renewable source , it ha to be used judiciously . a point would come when people themselves realises the importantance in conserving these non renewable . in that particular movement i am sure the number of car would gradually decrease . furthermore people would have to start using more ecological way of travelling a the pollution is increasing day by day and when the number of vechicles increase , so doe the pollution this would be harmfull for the environment . for example due to the chloro fluro carbon our ozone layer ha a huge hole which allows harmfull ultra violet ray to penetrate , thus leading to skin cancer and melting of the ice cap in the antartic region , gradually increasing the sea level leading to many island sub merging . gradually the government would realises the harmfull effect and introduce other mean of transport . in addition , fewer car are expected to be in the next twenty year owing to the fact that in twenty year people might be intrested in other gadget that could take them around . as we know a human we are intrested in owing the latest gadget than being happy with the gadget we own . for example the latest addition is the flying hanover craft - this basically get you to near by place . perhaps in twenty year we may have other gadget which would ultimately replace car . to sum it it up i feel that in twenty year or so we can expect the number of car to go down due to various reason like pollution , depletion of non renewable resource and technological improvement .
