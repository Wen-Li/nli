knowledge is divine . it doe not decrease if you spread it to others . there is nothing wrong in knowing about everything that is going around you . but , you have to look at your future . you are going to do a job , or run a business , for which your basic in that should be strong and you should have good knowledge about that subject . personally , i feel it is better to specialize in a particular , or specific subject . during your schooling day , you are taught on a variety of subject ; in brief . this knowledge is enough for any person . a person ha to decide a to what he is aiming at , and start working towards his aim by taking a specialization in that subject . this should start right from his secondary schooling day . in this fast paced world , it is very important for a person to specialize in any subject which he feel to be interesting . by doing so , he can grab the oppurtunity presented to him , in that specific subject , with both the hand . if he is not prepared for any specific job , there are chance that he might end up doing a job far lesser to what he is capable of doing . moreover specialization develops the interest in the subject , and he will feel satisfied with his job . if a person is not specialized in any subject , and he ha a broad knowledge of all the subject , he wo n't be able to recognize the subject of his interest , and he might end up doing a job from which he might not get enough satisfaction . for example , there is a person named anand . he wa a very bright student , but he used to focus on many subject . he went in search for a job , but he failed to get the job because he wa not good enough in that subject . hence , we must get specialized in one specific subject , and work towards acheiving our aim .
