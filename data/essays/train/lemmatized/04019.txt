being a teenager , i have to spend a considerable amound of time with teenager . therefore i am quite aware of the behaviour of young people considering community . i want to handle the approach of young people to helping community in two basic part which are education they are having and the era they are growing . the educational system is one of the important source of the young people 's attitude towards the community . in the past education system wa not only meant giving the scientific information . however teacher were able to educate the student in every aspect . for example if a student behaves to a friend or a teacher in a cruel way , that student wa being punished . in contrast today student are telling really discusting world to their teacher without getting no punishment . furthermore in the past since the mother were frequently hausewifes , they were able to follow their chidren 's education . however today since most of the parent both have to work to make their living , the education of the chidren are most of the time done by comunication device like television , internet . these cause the today 's young people to grow without respectful education and they become people who do n't help to the community . although education make up the very important part of the reason of young people 's behaviour towards the society , the era which we are living in , supply the important condition to make tenageers behave in that way . today , there are a lot of thing to do in order to spend time which are more enjoyable for young people . for example once upon a time my friend and i decided to organize a visit to the elderly people 's hause and we were not successful because we could find only three people to come with u . a lot of peole said they had another plan like going to cinema , doing sport , .. etc . in conclusion , it is obvious that i strongly agree with the starement that young people do n't pay enough attention in helpin to community . due to the people around me i am able to summarize theit bahaviour 's main reason which are their lack of education and the condition of the era they are growing .
