i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . because that is the reason why the advertisement really are . in almost all advertisement we can see only the good side of the product . we can only see the side effect or bad consequence only when there is any law or regulation that they should indicate them like tabbaco or medicine . advertisers want to sell their product more and more and have to compete with the product of other company . so they show the good-looking product with great function and hide the defect . and another reason is that the advertisement are made in the best circumstance in which the product can function most effectively . for example , in the clothing advertisement we can see the idealy good shaped person wearing the product . and we imagine the look that we are going to have with that clothes similar to the advertisement and come to buy the product . that is why i agree with this statement .
