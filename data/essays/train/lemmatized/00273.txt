many thing in the world are so complex , if we want to get all fact that it might be take a long time to understand all . in my opinion , the efficient way to learn thing is to get the main idea and concept , instead of understanding all the fact . the better way to know a fact is to attemp getting it by ourselves . if someone always tell you anything what you want , you will not know how difficult to get the knowledge . you just follow others step , without thinking deeply . you will not find other news dicovery , because you always think others ' opinion are correct . it will stop prodessing , and it make our brain get rusty . for instanse , when i wa studying in university , the professer always theach u the way to study , not following the book and reading that . the meaning of teacher is to help student find their way to research , they can tell u about different field talking about . if we are interested in some specific area , we should research more information about that by ourselves . afterward , analyze the information and discus with professers . it 's the way to learn knowledge , by mean of the mothod and we can find more necessary information than we expect . in my opinion , the better way to study is to understand main idea and concept . if we just follow ours ' opinion , we can just stay in the same place , without process . we should think something by ourselves , and it is possible for u to learn more thing which we should know .
