communities are made up of people and a community can only improve or be better if people in the community are willing to help and spend time on it . i agree that young people nowadays are occupied by so many other thing that their certain community is ignored . it is true that a the country develops the fundamental unit of the society - community become more and more important . activities are organised to raise the awarness of certain thing which people tend to forget a they become busier . for example , fundrasing idea are often raise in my school to either raise the awarness of mali , the country which we are spouncering or to raise money for their education or particular event happening in school . the 12th grade ha just did a spouncer walk to raise the spirit and awarness of mali . the outcome wa a great success , more student have a further understanding of what is mali like at the same time more than 700 pound is raise throught the activity . yet , a the industry develops , people race with time . things are forgotten especially when people are busy and therefore participate le in the community . for instance , a a senior in the school , there are so many thing that i need to worry , such a university application , personal statement and the academic work . there are very little time that i could spend on other thing else such for example , being part of the student government which improves student ' life at school or join sport team a an interest . these after school activites are time consuming , for student like me , time can said to be the most important factor at this stage and should eb used to study . in conlusion , young people like student nowadays do n't spend so much time helping their community , one reason is because student are occuppied by studying , another is reason is becasue if there are more intersting thing to do such a going to a movie , why bother to help the community which doe n't have direct effect on them .
