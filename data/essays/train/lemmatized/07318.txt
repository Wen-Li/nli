compared with traveling along , while most majority of people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , a small group of people choose to travel alone . there are advantage and disadvantage lie on both side . when the question come to me . i would rather vote a tour guide all by oneself . indeed , traveling alone involve a large number of benefit . the most obvious advantage is that you gain the maximal freedom when get to some place alone . as a single tourist . you may get rid of being regulated on the schedume by the tour guide . you may make a paticular schedume special tailored for yourself and to meet your own demand while a tourist who follows a guide may not ha such right to chose freely . therefore , the flexibility in making a plan serf a a significant force motived me to travel alone . the second advantage is that you can also chose the place most satisfy your personal taste freely . just imagine about it , your guide foof your group forced you to visit a famous church , but unfortunitely what you really want to explore is a medievil castle nearby . at this circumstance . youhave to follow your group , therefor you have to follow the guide . what a tragedy . what 's more , from traveling alone , not only can you chose the place to visit freely , but also you can make a large sum of new friend . shch opportunity can merely be obtained when you travel with a guide . it is really exciting and fantastic . on conclusion . if there is one day i travel to a place far away , i would rather travel alone for the sake of freedom , flexibility and potential friendship i may gain from my jouney
