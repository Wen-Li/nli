i agree with the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . first , i think the idea and consepts make the fact . just a fact a it is ha no meaning . for example , a for studing history , `` something war '' is not important . why they began war , what did the war bring them , is important to study . second , if student understand iedas and consepts , they can possibly make better fact from same idea and concept . let 's assume that the student studied about idea and concept of the car , some student maight think about other type of viecles . it may grow the imagination of the student . third , if student did n't understand idea and concept , they could use fact in the wrong way . it is sometimes dangerous . when i worked in sushi restaurant a a sushi chef , i trained a young lady . she did n't know why we used the rubber globe for cleaning . she touched the detergent by bear hand . then her hand b this is why i think understanding idea and concept are more important for student .
