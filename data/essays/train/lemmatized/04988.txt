if you want to travel , which way would you perfer to ? joining the group in a travel agency by a tour guide or only by yourself ? when we face the decision of this selecion , some people would deem theat visting the wounderful landscape by themselves since it will be full of myth and exciting . but for me , to be fank , i agree with attending the group . among countless reason which influence the choice , there are 3 conspicuous factor a follows : the first reason i agree with the statement is that traveling in a group by a helper will afford you more information about the view . for example , if you are in hangzhou which city be famous about the west lake , the tour guide will tell you more about recource you can not get from book or internet . the second factor can be seen by every person is that the group travelling will bring you more safety . the guide will tell you which thing you can do in the new place according the local 's custom , how to communicate with the local people . those make you have a peaceful and joyable time . if you are not familar with this , something unhappy will happen . furthermore , travelling with guide can save your time and enery in your jouney . as we know , we only have limited time to spend our holiday . we should have good use of our time in our jouney . so , company with the tour guide , you will get the most valueble information about where is the best place you have to see , and how to get the convenience way to get there . it give you the chance to attain the wonderful time . sure , for some brave people who want seek instinct , or specific experience , traveling alone is not bad way , but you may meet unpredict thing that maybe hurt you . for most of common people , life is worthy to perish . in a word , it is quite better way to travel in a group with a tour guide for it safty , fullful experience and saving way . taking accounot of these aspect , we can reach the conclusion .
