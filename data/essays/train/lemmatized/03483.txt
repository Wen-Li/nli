there are many successful poeple in various field in this world . it can be business , sport , art , or science . however , there is a common thing that those successful people have : successful pople try new thing , take risk , and also respect the tradition and the old way that have been known for a long time . for example , a tennis player can not start creating a new way of hitting spine serve without knowing how to hit the ball properly . the player ha to go thorough the tough step of learning basic hitting technique before doing something new . therefore , knowing and respecting the tradition and the old way is the fundemental step for the person to be successful . however , just knowing about the past is not good enough for most case . here , i will use an example of a researcher in biology lab . even if the researcher obtained good grade during his/her undergraduate level and have great ability of learning what other scientist have done in the past , the researcher is not granteed to be a successful scientist if she/he lack the ability of creativity . so , the ability to apply what the person have learned about the tradition and the old way into new thing is the second important element to be successful . taking risk may be the third element to be successful ; however , it is not the case in some field . for example , a doctor with a great knowledge and ability to adopt it can not take risk to cure his/her patient if the doctor 's attempting and taking risk result in a number of patient ' death . however , it is also true that surgents and physician often take risk in operation room in order to help thier patient . finally , being successful is not neccessary important , and maybe it is not something other people judge if the person is successful or not . as long a the person is satisfied with his/her life and provides a great influence for the world , the person can be considered a `` successful '' .
