most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , and i think this is cheeting on pepoel , it like covering a book from it titel . i disagree with making product look much better then what they really are , firstly is that it cheeting on pepoel from buying the product on what they think it is by looking at it for example i want to buy a table it cheap and in good shap but after i use it , it doesnt continue one day and it broken . althought it might be danger for pepeol using it , example buying a chair wich look graet and strong and an old man sits on it and sudden the man fall down he will get heart , so sometimes it could cause some dameges because of what it look then what it really is . another thing is that these product wont be usfull for nothing just will be bought and thrown away the next day because it of no use so why wast these thing and try to make product more usfull then on how it look . in my opinion i think the advertisments should make the product more usfull than what it look instead of making it much better than what it really is because at the end the product is made to be used not to look at only .
