on the one hand , risk is something unknown so you can never bet if it 'll turn well or not , but on the other hand , i 'm sure if you do n't take any risk you 'll never be successful . although some people think that success is not about risk but just a result of their personal ability , i agree with the statement because different experience convinced me to that . first of all , i think about history and all the mathematician , philosopher , writer ( let 's think about galileo , giordano bruno , newton and so on ) who often challenged the way of thinking of their age and because of that they almost died poor and alone . but what 're we still studying in high school or even in a ph . d ? eventually they were able to carry their idea through century and we would n't ever have their thought and teaching if they did n't risk during their life . they contributed to create our way of thinking so they 're really are among the most successful people ever existed . another experience convinces me that risk is an inner quality in successful people . i 'm talking about all the story we read on the internet or book about poor people who decide to change their life drastically , maybe starting a new business , or `` playing '' at the stock exchange market , and suddendly create an empire ( did n't bill gates start in a garage , did he ? ) if there were no risk , nothing would ever been created . now thousand of people work thanks to the risk taken by someone in the past , is n't that successful ? from my point of view , nowadays many people could get wrong on the concept of successful , it 's not just about business and creating money and that 's why i consider successful all the international organization 's member ( and every peace \ maker there ) who everyday challenge incredibly dangerous situation risking their life in war country or simply helping child with mortal disease in africa . that 's what really make a better world . in conclusion i think that everyone should take his or her own risk , maybe in what they do the best , in order to become successful considering that not any risk is worthy to take
