i agree that for student understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . a couple of example drawn by my own experience convince me of this . in school , be it high school or university , student start familiarizing with a broad range of concept that profoundly influence their way of thinking and acting . concepts and idea provide an individual of a young age with a framework for thinking and following a certain methodology . for instance , in an art course , a student familiar with the underlying concept of cubism will be more able to draw inference on other work of art of the same period than a student who ha focused on the biographical data of an artist or on the name of his work . moreover , the student who master the value who are at the basis of cubism will be also able to relate them to similar current of different field , such a philosophy , literature , music . a student who ha focused on pure fact could face some problem in linking up several fact if these belongs to different ` realm ' . although it is important to have a good knowledge of example of specific fact or event , it is indispensable to understand concept and idea a they provide a good methodology for analyzing and understanding the reality a it appears to u , especially when we have no prior background information to rely on . in a medium class , understanding which tool are needed to analyze a certain radio show can be useful in the event we have to design the analysis for a totally new medium product from scratch , such a a new internet-based application or an upcoming information technology . finally , although fact are part of the cultural ` baggage ' everyone us everyday , can be considered of secondary importance than concept and idea which provide the framework for thinking and acting .
