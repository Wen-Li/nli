i agree with the statement . i personally strongly believe that a an student , to understand idea and concept in any subject is very important . there are several reason of why i support the statement based on my personal experience . first , to understand idea and concept require certain level of reading comprehension skill so that student can fully acquire the essense of the fact or the context that they are trying to understand . in other word , student are not just understanding the concept , but gaining and improving the reading skill to interprete what is written and said in their textbook . secondly , by fully understanding the context of the fact , student can translate what they have learned and share with others , which enable them to discus their own idea and opinion . i think this is a very important excercise a student bacause by doing that , student can learn how to express their level of understanding a well a to have the oppoutunity to hear about others ' opinoins on the same subject , which also enebles them to look at thing differently if others opinion are different from their own . thirdly , just learning fact might end up making student to memorize the fact and end up forgetting everything a time go by especially if the context are not interesting to student . growing up in japan , where style of education tends to focus largely on memorizing , i know how dangerous it could be . in japan , even in the subject of mathematics , which is require high level of understanding the concept and logic behind the equation that are often used in solving problem , student are told and encouraged to remember fact ( in this case , many complicated equation ) . just memorizing the fact and not fully understanding the idea behind them , those fact can not be stayed in the student `` brain '' not even a information , but disappear soon later on . having lisiting those reason , i strognly believe that it is important for student to understand idea and concept about whatever they learn in school . in addition , to make them realize what they have leared , it is ideal to have the opportunity to share their thought . by doing those activity , their knowledge will not disappear a `` memorized '' fact will do .
