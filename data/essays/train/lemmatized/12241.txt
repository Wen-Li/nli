ideas concept and fact . they are 3 diffrent meaning altogether . ideas and concept could be improvised from time to time . facts keep thier stance . ideas can not be taught are laerned they have to be brought up by the individual themselves . concepts can be taught and from there can be implied on any given situation . facts remain a fact can not be changed or improvised unless disproven by proof . students should learn both in a manner that can be used in the future . ideas and concept supported by fact can make a innovation . agreeing with the topic saying that idea and concept are more important than fact are more important . facts can also be learned by experience , good or bad . if learning by a good experience is good , but laerning with a bad experience could be harmful or irreversible . when a child is told smoking is bad because is cause all sort of cancer and other life threating dieases . the child defies his parent and still continues the habbit and then realizeis he is too late for the change is bad . this is a sort of fact which should be taught . people often tell lie to escape a situation . what they dont realize is that they tell one lie which leeds to another . then at the end the truth is heard out . for saying that lie he is punished in resulting in a suspenion or a firing from work . the fact in this is that do not lie . in learning a concept and an idea a lot can be learnt . when we learn something new we understand it and use it in our daily life . we can improvise it on using that idea on diffrent thing . the human body is like a business . the concept here is on simple business deman and supply and supply chain . the stomach requires raw materails to produs the produst which is energy . exess of this product can be used to make a better image of the company which is you expample a better body . then there is a office of the company which is your brain . there is the market reasearch department which is your sens . in this exaple i have just demonstrated how i have linked my concept of biology and business to co-relate which each other . hence i will disagree about the point .
