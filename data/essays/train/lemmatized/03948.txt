in these modren day the technology is developing rapidly , we are going in to competitive world with very complex technology so inorder to survive in this modren world so one must have good knowledge of many academic subject . the broad knowledge of many academic subject make the person to think more flexible a he get wide variety of knowledge , he can grow up to his own with out any dependency , when we come to person carrier it can be flourished and ha no limit only the sky will be . when the person is having broad knowledge on differnt academic subject he can help out others with the knowledge and become a useful resource to many others . for example our proffessor mr john ha wide knowledge on all the academic subject that we have in this semister he can explain and help u out at any time and the thing said by him simple and esoteric , so one can acheive by having good knowledge on differnt subject . this knowledge make him to know that which subject sound well and which is the interesting one and make him to know the general awareness of all the subject . when we get into job then we need to work on differnt platform just by knowing only one subject we cant survive in this world so differnt knowledge make a person better and make to get well adjust to the environment he is living more over there are some disadvantage also by having the broad knowledge on different subject the first thing is he can not manage to have broad knowledge on differnt subject it quite difficult for him , he can not get specialized when he ha such broad knowledge he can just emphazize on the subject rather than revealing it . when we come to this specialization on one specific subject that serf a big purpose for example consider doctor , a general doctor ha just idea on the particular disease but he refers to specialist in case to heal it or to survivie the patient from it , so specialization is also equally considered important . finally i think both the strategy have equal importance the first one make more point than second .
