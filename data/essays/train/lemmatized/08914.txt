teenagers have always been the hope and the backbone of our society . just like the relationship between teacher and student , teenager bares the burden of achieving greater success than their parent . but doe this mean that the older generation 's life are easier and happier than young people ? no , i neither agree or disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . first , we will talk about young people . nowadays , young people are the representation of our fast-changing society . to most of them , life is a tideous fact which they can not escape . faced with large amount of academic study in school , family pressure such a not fulfilling their demans to achieve good mark at school , and also family violence and the possibiliy of loosing a father or mother from a early divorce . young people today are also threatened with the corruption of our society . our medium influence our young mind with movie , music , news and advertisement . and what do young people learn from them ? violence , sex , dishonest , and many more unvirtous thing . a great example would be the increasing number of young gang member in our sociey . many of them were born and raised just like any other child , but the moment they turn on the 50 cent rap song , they are addicted . addicted not only by the beat of the music , but also corrupted by it content . many of them began to immitate certain celebraties they adore without realizing whether the thing they learn from these so-called `` artist '' are teaching them . some of them might even start walking the road towards crime . so can we say that young people enjoy life more than older people do ? i do n't think so . on the other hand , the older generation face new problem too . today , we live in a world with little or no morale contiousness . in countires such a china , the old confucianism which binded the traditional way of life is disappearing . children do not respect the elder no more , they can argue with rudeness , they can have sex before they get married , they can smoke in school , they can dress themselves like whore and criminal . although our government have funding for the old people when they retire , but that 's not what old people really want . most old people have experienced wealth , fame and love , they do not need elegant house and expensive car . they just need a good physical and mental health . and despite the little amount of money for any old person to live other than the medical fee , what they need is love , love and caring from their kid . statistics have shown that a lot of old people die of lonelyness and frustration other than physical illness . all that said , do older people live better life than young people ? i think neither . finally , i conclude that neither young or old people have enjoy life more . the young troubled with pressure within themselves , they are faced with social and family pressure . the old are left alone and isolated from the rest of the society a if they are useless . to improve the situation , i think the only solution is instead of wealth and fame , people should pay more attention to morale principle .
