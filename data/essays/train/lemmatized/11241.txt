i agree with that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because of my experience . first , understanding idea and comcepts give me more deep thinking than learning fact . if we check a dictionary , search internet , we can easily find a fact . although it take a long time to understand idea and comcepts , they raise my thought . it contributes our thinking . it is good chance to understand idea and concept for student . as student , we need to train our brain to understand idea and concept . second , understanding idea and concept give me interest . one day , i heard the fact that the time length of all compact disk is about 80 minute . i wondered why the length is decided after i heard the fact immediately . i always need reason . therefore , i tied to look for the idea and i found . the reason wa interesting that the longest popular classic music is about 80 minute . i wa excited to know the idea after i learned the factor . third , i am not satisfied to learn only fact . it is natural for me to attempt to understand idea and concept . if i only learned fact , i do not feel that i learned something at all . i always like to know something . however , i think that it is useful to know only fact . i can not explain what i know without idea and concept in addition to fact . i need enough information what i know . even though i know just fact , it lack my knowledge . in conclusion , i agree with the importance of understanding idea and cencepts tha learning fact for student because of raising student ' deep thinkng , stimulating interest , and satisfaction .
