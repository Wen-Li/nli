at a first sight , it can be inferred that young people show no interest in helping their community and that they seem to have become more ego-directed , in order to prevent themselves from the duty that a society is asking them . a likely explanation might be that to help the community is no more seen a convenient a it used to be , a it is not rewarded enough . young people do n't feel this a a duty , and think that the world would probably go on without no help from them . furthermore , young people seem to live for the present moment and not for the future , almost a they feel that the duty toward a society will not effect their own future , or the future of next generation . but is most of the youngers seem to share these opinion , it is absolutely not true for all . some of them , who are likely grown up with strong ideal and a steady sense of tradition , still continue to putting their effort to helping their community . it might be that people living in small town are easily influenced and touched by community problem . is not unusual for them to be prepared in helping because of the surroundings where they live in . i would n't say that youngers living in the city are not able to do that , on he contrary , thanks to device provided by the city , they can easily help community if they are interested in . compared to few decade ago , the modern society we are living in ha , with no doubt , passed through a huge number of changings . given that , it 's hard to say which of them ha really brought an improvement or a decrease in the quality of everyday life . what is certainly true is that young people summerize the most important and common feature of a society .
