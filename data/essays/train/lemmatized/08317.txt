today , there are many way in that we can travel around the world , among others , buy a tour package or prepare own trip . the first way , in general , includes a trip in group with a tour guide , but in the second option is possible travel alone without tour guide . each of this method to travel have a lot advantage that i will describe . the first point i would like to state is the advantage to travel in a group led by a tour guide can be a fun experience , becouse it is possible know to new people in the trip , moreover , in this kind of trip many friend decide to buy the same tour , and this is good reason to take it . other advantage is that the person that buy the tour are safer , since they are not alone in any place that they are going to visit . for example , one time i traveled to europe with a friend , we bouth a tour and we could to visit only place that were inside the schedule of tour , obviously all these place were safe for tourist . by other hand , in spite of the compelling advantage mentionated in the last paraghrap , i think that travel alone without tour guide is the best way to spend time on vacation . when a person travel alone , he or she can decide what time he will arrive , what place he will visit , where he will sleep and what he will eat , etc . for instance , last vacation i went to brasil , i enjoyed a lot my trip , i could move to different hotel according my own decision and no one gave me order about my time . overall , there are many factor to consider when we must decide about how we travel , but according to the strong advantage point out on travel alone without tour guide , i think that it is the best way . the first method to travel have the essential advantage that there is someone that lead the trip and it is safer for people that take it , but the most important advantage the second method is that the person is more free .
