i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product much better than they really are . it is originated from the nature of the advertisement , the celebrity influence and weasal word in ad . the purpose of advertisement is to get you to buy the product . of course , advertiser will try their best to make the advertisement a appealing a possible . how to acchive that goal ? they will have to exaggerate the product , sometimes unintentionally . for example , certain vacuum machine claim that it will never lose grib of dirt on tv . we all know that it can not be true simply because all machine can not always perform the best with aging . additonally , commercials use celebritoes to add glamour to their product . everyday , we see paris hilton , jessica simpson and britney spears appearing on tv with perfect make-up and well-fit jean . we might imagine if we use that makeup that we will look just like them . obviously , it is not true . not everyone ha such a good face and such a sexy body , but the commercial mislead u to dream of that , those advertisement make the product seem so much better than they really are . finally , there are full of weasal word to fansinate customer , such a `` better '' , `` younger '' , '' faster '' , `` more '' , when a toothpaste advertisement say '' we kill more oral germ than competitive brand doe '' . we have to ask `` how much more ? '' one more ? two more ? or in fact no more at all ? it can not be proved . it alwalys easier to talk the talking . similarily , when a car say it can run faster , we have to know what the car is faster than . a bike ? a scooter ? in conclusion , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are due to the nature of advertisement , the celebrity influence and weasal word . we have to use our own judgement to choose carefully something that is really good for u . do n't follow ad blindly .
