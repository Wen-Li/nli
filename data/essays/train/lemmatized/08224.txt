understanding the idea and concept is important in any learning process , but if the student ignore or were not able to learn and focus on the fact , that will be reflected on them in understanding the whole topic or subject . from my point of view , i think that studying and focusing on fact is not le important than studying and learning concept and idea and this is because of many reason , first is the need for the implementation of idea and concept , so when we take the nujrsing student a an example , nursing student read the concept of some medical terminology throughout the course of their major but if these student do not implement what they read , this will be reflected negatively on them after they graduate and start their career , second is the need to observe the application of these concept and idea , and for this point i will mention the medical surgical student a an example , when the student only study and read the concept of suturing and wound dressing and only look at picture in the book , they will never be able to practice these concept , another reason that indicates that the fact are important , the pyramid in egypt , many of the student in the school of engineering learn about the concept of archticture used to build the pyramid and a these concept confiscated the most of u it will be more confiscating to some of these student a will , except if they watch the illustration video for the structure and archticture of the pyramid , and the fact of building these pyramid in the inside and the outside will be more clear to them . a a conclusion , learning of idea and concept will be confusing for any student in any major or feild of study and will not be convincing enough , so the level of satisfaction for that student will be lower except if that student wa exposed to the fact of the topic he is learning
