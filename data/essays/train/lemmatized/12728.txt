most adverisement make prodcuts seem much better than really are this is a theme that is always in the spotlight , and is always so controversial , that create always the same question . what could happen if the market when they are promoting product or service be a they are in real life , no fantasy , no like gold , that eventually marketing do that to their product ? . like they were , new the only thing that ha n't reach the market . well when people asked me about my opinion of this , i think a great idea to put your prodcuts like there is nothing like them . because thats the reason they are selling . and if we do n't do it , i bet a lot of selling of some product will come down just right away . because in the other hand we have prodcuts that doe n't need that publicity , since is a basic product , and no matter what you do n't is going to keep selling . i know that not the best thing to do , some people just felt terrible went something is underneath their expectation , just make you feel like it wa n't worth it . that your money is value . and to lie or play with your mind is just doe n't feel right . in my personal opinion i feel angry , and just want to takeit back . but that the point of marketing and publicity , and those advertisement tehy put on the street and meka you feel that sensation to own one of those . the main point of marketing is to grow up the selling , and if that what they need to do , is valid , they are not making nothing illegal . maybe may though of this , with agreing with the advertisement , is that some day in the future a would like to have my own company , and is i need to use that kind of cheat , i will use it without a questioned .
