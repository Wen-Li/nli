i 'm agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do . because i think that older people have good memory a many a bad memory . maybe they had enjoyed life in young time too . i think that the older they become , the more complex their life become . it is dufficult for older people to enjoy life . they do n't enjoy rehter feel happiness that they have now , and remember their good memory . so young people have destiny to will have experience bad thing more than now . they should enjoy their young life .
