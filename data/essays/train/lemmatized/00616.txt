according my opinion are both necessary , in this century . to answer the question is necessary , previously , to explain better the issue , because the mainly topic , according my attitude , is what you want to do in your life , what is your porpuse , who want to become . everything will change consequently . therefore , if you want an easy life , not much complicated , taking the first job that you find , you mu n't have a specific knowledge , but if you have one general , that 's right . on the other hand , whether you want to go to the `` top '' , in this case , it 's not enought a general knowledge but is much better if you have a specialize , to have a personal specialization , to be unique , to be different to the other . such you will have more possibility to realize your dream . in conclusion , according my life porpuse i disagree with that statement but sumirize it depends by your schedule 's life , your dream , your choice 's life . each person is different and it 's the beauty of the life !!! take your choice , take your life such you make your life .
