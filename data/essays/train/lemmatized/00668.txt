the author 's assertion that - `` it is more important to understand the concept and idea rather than learn fact '' , i partially agree with the saying . true understanding of any subject is to be said - when all the idea and the purpose should be clearly known but how one can imply thes into practicality ? for this to be done , an individual ha to learn the fact supporting the idea . they work a a pack and package to acheive completeness . an example which support the notion that understanding give the base of any subject which can further be expanded to opt for the research in any particular field . for-example one ha learned all the date and origin of any technology a well a how doe it work but do not know any thing about the concept and logic regrding how it work ? then this might not lead problem for the instance now but later when some drawback come in the technology and need to be modified this time all knowledge would appear to be mere waste . furthe , while watching a television one might not have information about what are the characteristic of a picture tube or how the quality can be improved because we are interested in learning only fact how to operate in order to fulfill our desire for entertainment but if we understands the funtionality then this might help in improving and getting more better picture quality . furthermore , this can be clearly understood by the illustration that , for a mathematics student it is necessary to understand the concept and idea related to a topic but one can not imply those concept without learning the fact . here the fact implied to the formula which is mandatory to learn to get a solution . concepts and idea sometimes sufficient to deal efficeiently with the problem but it might take longer time than employing formula which is a short-cut method to reach the answer . but sometimes gap of formula can be filled from the concept but vice-versa is not true in order to make it empirical . to conclude , it is true that in some way concept and idea outways the fact but the their worth can not be reduced to minimal because fact needed to strengthen the concept and idea . it actually enhances and broden the knowledge of the subject . the two thing are like our both hand . one can not measure the significance of one over another .
