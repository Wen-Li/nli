i think i am a kind of person who like doing what i already know how to do well and i think i am a successfull person . but i well know some of my friend who become so successful by trying new thing . but i think these people are not too much . there are good reason to try new thing and it must be excited to take risk in some situation . but i think people should concantrate in just one aspect and should do just one work in a best way . people can be successful only doing the work that already know how to do well . because you must spend some time and effort to learn new thing . for instance i decided to learn playing viola at the beganing of the university instead of playing piano . i used to play piano when i wa in primary school . i have never played viola before . therefore i wa unsuccessful . if i had chosen to improve my ability in piano i am sure i would become more successful . i think this statement is more about the trade . because my father have a company and he prefer to do diffrent work regarding his own work . he always chooses to take risk . but sometimes he becomes successful and sometimes he doe n't . i want him to go on doing he already do . because he is well aware of this work and also he ha good experience in this work . but there is no insurance in the new work . he doe n't well know whether he will be successful . because of the reason that i stated above , i do n't agree with this statement . according to my experience i can say that , only the people who try to do thing that they well know are successful people .
