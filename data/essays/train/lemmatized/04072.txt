i disagree with this statement because when i travel alone , i will just care about my self . but if i travel with a group , i will take care of all of them . inadditon , traneling alone is saver , cheeper and more interesting than with a group . first , it is saver because when people travel alone , they will focus in the road that they are driving on . for example , once i traveled from city to an other city by a car and alone at night . while i wa driving my car , i saw a big camel on my way . i thought that i would die but i passed this animal because i wa focussing and also lucky . second , it is cheeper because people who travel alone , they will need le food and le drink than others , for example , when i travel with my friend to somewhere , we stop to eat in restaurant but when i travel alone i just eat anything from any store
