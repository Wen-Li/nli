although travelling in a group led by a tour guide could have a great positive impact on the traveller experience and knowledge base , such perk are more that often diminished in comparison to the manifold problem and distraction that arise from such trip . it is true that tour guide , especially local one , are more knowledgeable when it come to their city and provide deeper insight and plausible suggestion on what and where to see and do . futhermore , in a group situation , being part of event and trip is usually more interesting and enjoyable and provides a great opportunity to meet other people and make new friend . however having a tour guide and being part of a group could hinder the overall experience of a city or place due to the numerous formality and regulation they tend to emphasize . with tour guide come cast in concrete planning of every minute and hour of every day , week and month . since tour guide are managing large group of people it is very important to keep time and schedule for every aspect of the trip ; from visiting monument and tourist site to dining and sleeping . unfortunately , this would take away all the spontaneaity from the trip rendering it very systematic , dry and simply boring . not knowing what you are going to do for the day , or sleeping in in another might be all that you need to rejuvenate yourself during your travel . paralleling such argument and in response to the dynamic of group travelling , many other negative aspect usually arise . having too many people would usually result in conflict ; it is very hard to get consensus in the case of a decision making situation . furthermore , it is the nature of a group to include people from diverse background and value system . this would more than often surface at some point and cause some kind of disagreement that would result in a bigger complication that both party would have to keep up with until the end of the trip . therefore , one can avoid such problem when travelling by choosing to travel with a couple of friend or family member instead of being part of large highly organized systematic group experirnce . having a guide book or asking local for suggestion would adequately substiture for a nagging tour guide . now a person could be more spontaneas and not governed by rule and regulation on the only true break he/she might get per year . i believe i have strong conviction towards my opinion for the reason that i wa part of a group trip that wa led by a tour guide for too long period of time during one of my summer vacation and that certainly did not turn out to be a good experience .
