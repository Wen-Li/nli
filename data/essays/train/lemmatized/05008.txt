it will be better to have a knowledge of many academic subject because after you have all those academic subject in your brain cell you wo n't be have to worry any problem with class work . for my first point of view will be that if we have all those knoledge in the brain we can be much more cleverer and we wo n't have to ask the classmate about the problem that we have . we can solve it ourself . it will be better to do it yourself than asking the others because it will be quite embarrasing . you will have to look at others face just to wait for their answer and i 'll prefer not to do that . nextly will be to get a better grade because we have many academic subject in our head normatter how many subject in a day we will be able to know must of the need in the topic . and than at the end of the year or tearm when the grade come out you will be proud of your ownself . some more student will come to you and ask you the question that their do n't understand so you can be their teacher to teach them what ever thing their need and they will look up on you my last point will be the teacher , sometimes you can find the teacher struggling on some question and you can prom them by telling them some clue so they will know what to do after all . you might be able to be their top student a will . so whenever they need help with their work you can teach them . they might give you a better effect and grade . my conclusion is that we surely better to have a board knowledge and many academic subject in the brain than haveing blank in the head when you are doing some kind of test .
