in this society , understanding idea and concept and learning fact are both important to the student . normally , most of people think first step is to understand idea and concept , and then second step is to learn fact , so student can use the idea and concept what they understood into learning fact and make it easy to learn . however , for some reason , i prefer to learn fact is more important for student than to understand idea and concept . the main reason is after student learn fact first , their own opinion and question of the fact will appear in their brain . they may have a different or a similar idea or concept of the fact . therefore , after teacher tell student what is the true idea and concept , they may get the answer of their question and prove their correct opinion in their mind . it help student understand the fact in a better and faster way and get to use what they learn in the fact . then , after student learn fact and understand idea and concept , they may use what they get in real life easily , and it decrease the probablity of making mistake . when student are getting to learn fact better and better , they are in their way to understand idea and concept at the same time . in fact , understanding and learning have some similar advantage , student will get the idea and use into the fact at the end anyways . everything depends on the student , like which way is better to them to learn and understand . different people may have different opinion . however , for me , learning fact first contains more advantage than understanding the idea first . therefore , i agree it is more important for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept .
