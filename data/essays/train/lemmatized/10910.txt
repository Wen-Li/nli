the communitiy give an environment that help u to learn , grow and progress in life . therefore helping the community is an important responsibility of every citizen . however , we freqeuntly find young people of the current generation not giving enough time for the benefit of the community on account of varied reason such a lack of availability of time , lack of awareness , etc . but , i feel that many young people do work for community service in some form . increased competition and complexity besiege the life and career of many young people of the current generation . young people are busy advancing their personal goal in life and seldom find time for community service . many-a-times lack of awareness about option available for community service in a area lead one to not give enough time for community service . we find numerous example of people of such kind . however , to conclude that all young people do not give enough time to community service would not be appropriate . there are several organization like the `` yuva '' in mumbai which are channelizing the effort of the young people interested in community service . the number , membership and work of such organization is growing . also , there a lot of young graduate these day who choose community service a a career option even when they have to accept lower salary . increase satisfaction serf a their prime motivation . besides , especially in india , i see a lot of people choosing civil service option with an objective of serving the society . thus , we see a mixed trend in the dedication of the young people of the current generation to their community . on one hand , we find young people who are completely selfish and do not care about community , while on the other hand we find those that dedicate themselves for community service . most of the people stand some where in between . on the whole , i find that the awareness about , interest in , and effort towards community service are increasing .
