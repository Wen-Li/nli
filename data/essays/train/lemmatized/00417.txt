i will agree to the statement that `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . if we learn idea and understand concept then we can question those idea which would lead to new way of thinking and lead to discover new thing . if we learn fact then there is nothing much to change either you know the answer or you do not , but if you new the concept that lead to the fact then the student would use that concept to arrive at the answer . for example if the student wanted to know the circumference of a pentagon then if the student only learned fact the he may have forgotten the equation , but if a student knew that circumference of any object wa the total length of the side then he can add the length of each side and get the answer . the importance of education is not in knowing the capital of all country nor in learning the entire science book by heart but to use , what the student ha learned in the school , in his every day life , to better his life , to use it when faced with a challenge and come out winning . learning fact may help you sometimes in your life but completely understanding the subject will always help you . there are six basic question to everything - when ? where ? why ? how ? what ? which ? if you knew the answer to only one question then the education would be incomplete , only by understanding the entire concept will the student know all the answer and the exact meaning of a subject . lastly on a broader note , for a society to evolve and progress in culture and education we need new idea , new concept because if we do not develop new idea we would still believe that earth wa flat and wa the center of the universe , this way of thinking would have had a detrimental effect on human a a whole and we would still be living like animal .
