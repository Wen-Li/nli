in response to the statement given sideways , i express my approval for it . young people nowadays seem to be more interested and involved in their own life and problem than the community a a whole . the present day world ha undergone a dramatic change than it used to be , say a generation ago . it ha become much more competitive and demanding . the advent of globalisation ha led to drastic repercussion . in today 's world only the best can survive . recently an article wa there in newspaper on globalisation . it wa stated there that globalisation is producing rich country with poor people not only in developing country but also in developed country like the united states . the fruit of globalisation are mainly distributed among the rich and the highly skilled person . unskilled and le skilled labor are no longer the recipient of these fruit . this put an immense pressure on young people to achieve great skill in whatever art they are pursuing . they could not devote enough time for other cause , like any work related to the upliftment of their community . for them their own survival is the key issue . they want to be a part of the ongoing globalisation . moreover , they do not find any potential benefit in lending a helping hand to their community . all they can think of is their own well-being . whether they are getting any output by doing so , is what the young people 's thinking is . in short , the world ha become much more materialistic . also young people lack the sense of responsibility which prevents them in helping their community . they think that just by being a part of a community and following it rule and regulation is sufficient . they have forgotten the fact that with right come duty . so , i would once again like to support the statement that young people are not giving enough time in helping their community .
