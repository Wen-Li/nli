group travelling with a tour leader and individual travelling have both their advantage and disadvantage but i favor to go on an individual travel than a guided group vactaion which would like to point out in the following text . the group travel most likely have a worked out visit plan and a time schedule . the people in the group will not have their own choice what to visit and it might sometimes be very intersting and other time just boring . on of the main problem here is to be obliged to follow the pace of the group and not your own . i will not be able to skip a site which is of le excitement for me . on travel to foreign country i like to stop at certain place for a longer time and enjoy talking to people about their daily life . this way i might learn more about their life and culture than visiting one church or museum after another . although i also adore going to historical meaningful place which form culture and life of people just in my own speed . during a group travel the individual will most likely visit many interesting site of a certain country or city , which might not accesible for an individual and will obtain a lot of information about them . but a i already mentioned for me quantity is not always quality . i would consider me a a lucky person since i have many friend all over the world . one day i hope to be able to visit them and explore their country with my own private tour guid
