it is better to start with describing the successful people ; they have an unlimited brain , they do not think like normal people and they are capable to get used to new condition . after this description it is not possible to disagree the ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing twhat they alredy know how to do well ' idea . `taking risk make money ' and ` more risk = more money ' is accepted idea in economy and this idea force successful people to go on doing something new . success is a sick , like using some illegal drug , when you start overcoming some problem ( we call it success ) you need more to make yourself more successed . we can say it is not only making some money , it is trying to make ( earn ) all money in the world . that is why succeed people trying to give self-cofidence to their child than teaching some specific formula . successful people ha an interesting risk management ability , at the same time this ability have made them successful . some unsuccessful people might be succeed , just one or two success are enough for them they can stop going ahead after creation is completed . we can call their success a luck . they know that it wa their luck and they do not want to risk to loose everything they earned actually they can not do it . but really successful people , like in the statement , use their previous experience on next job and they know that they can do the next better . i absulately agree that successful people can not be limited or stopped with just several success . also they agree that ` doing what they already know how to do well ' will kill their successful mind . making more succes need taking more risk idea is in their blood and these kind of people is not programmed to stop after a while .
