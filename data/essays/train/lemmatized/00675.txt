my interpretation of successful people is not just based in either try something new or take risk . however i agree with those people that believe that by doing new thing , they may get a better chance and opportunity in life , if the case is that their reality is not good enough for themselves . i think that get new idea , give a try to new experience , let you open your mind to a very important thihgs such a tolerance , diversity and knowlodge . along my short life , i been thinking that life is a beautiful moment , that let you choose . that each one of u take their own risk , even to let pas the good oportunities or even to take them , however not always take the risk is good and is the best choice . i believe that if you do n't let go the thing out , if you just close your life and you do n't look higher of what you have , life can become pretty plane . i respect all of these people that rather being in the same place and doing the same work during all their life , than the one that feel that learn and have a bigger knowledge doing something new , is part of grow and really enjoy life . however , i would like to ask these people , how they preffer being who they are , and doing what they do , if they do n't know something else ? here i am not talking about success , i am talking about happiness and according with my own thought and idea , happiness connect success and success people is happy .
