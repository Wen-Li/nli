power , money and reputation are very desirable thing , and if you are successful in your job , you probably have them all . due to that , success play an important role in our life . the question arises , how to be successful . you could try new thing and take a risk , or you could focus on what you already know how to do well . in my opinion , you can be successful with both strategy . on the one hand there are lot of company which improved an already existing successful product . for instance apple . they choose the normal mp3 player and improved the storage capacity , the handling , the design and named it ipod . due to the improvement and a huge marketing campaign , they sold an incredibly high number of ipods all over the world . the success of this product wa outrageous ! on the other hand , remember the foundation story of the apple company - an almost perfect example for creating a new market . with the computer for common household , they invented a completly new product and took a high risk . as we all know , the product wa accepted by the market and had an enormous impact on the society . there are numerous other example for both strategy and therefore i disagree with the statement that people who try new thing are more successful than people who do what they already know to do well . because of the high risk , i would rather tend to focus on thing which i do well , and where i know very well how to operate .
