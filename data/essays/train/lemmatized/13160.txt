i think that it better to specialize in a specific subject , because you will have the chance to be the greatest in that subject you choose , instead if you make many academic subject , it doe n't matter how good you are you will not be able to perform a great a if you study a specific subject . i think that if you study many subject you will not make your best in any of them , form diferent reason . first you will not have time to dedicate youself to an especific subject for a long amount of time , that make more dificult for you to explore all the aspect of that subject . then you also will have to past many year at university studing , and almoast any time to work our burn other part of your life . i think that specialize in one subject is a great way to get a huge amount of knowledge , this will help you in the future by making you a great worker . also this will help you to find a job easily because campanies will search for worker by and specific subject and not for haw many subject you know that are not compleatly specified . for example if i am lokooking for a computer enginner because i have a wireless network in my company , i will go to a job center to find the employee i need , and i found two computer enginneres one with a with a computer engennir degree only and anonther with a computer enginner bdegree but with a specialization in wireless network . i will choose the one with the specialization because he fit perfect in what my need . in conclution a specilize worker will enter earlier to a company that will use him acording to what he studied and like , making him a productive person that have a big chance of success in live .
