a person that is educated is highly regarded while , an uneducated person might sometimes be seen down upon . knowledge is a way of knowing that many people should praise upon and take this advantage to their own good . i do agree that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to have of one only . this way a person would know a great deal of thing in more than one thing and he/she would normaly share their knowledge with other people and get also information about other subject themselves . an example might be , a person that specializes in a particular field of study such a chemistry and another person that ha abroad knowledge of a lot of subject including chemistry meet up . the first person might only discus chemistry while the other , person discus more than one subject . to me in this situation the person with the broad knowledge is infact , smarter and more experienced than that person that specialize in chemistry . because that person might not answer or feel lost when the other person talk about other topic . another reason , might be that the person with the broad knowledge of many academic subject migh find it easier to understand and learn about various topic . on the other hand the person that is specialized in a single subject might find it difficult to cope with the other topic that might be introduced to him/her . an example would be if he business major student wa in a contest with the other student that take business and other subject . he/she might win or gain point in answering question that deel about business but , when it come to answering other question he/she might have a hard time answering it . again i do stand by my opinion that , a person should have great understanding in many academic subject rather in one . who know when that person need to persuade another person in an area other than his/her own . it might be helpful if they know information in more than one topic .
