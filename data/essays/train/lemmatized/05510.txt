i agree with this opinion that succeful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they arleady know to do well . the reason i agree with this opinion is that succcss ha something to do with people 's mind . if someone trying to something that they want to it , they can make success someday . another reason is that trying to make success by developing own personality . for example , i usually rode a bike to go to school , once time i trid to drive my father 's car , when i first took a car , it is really difficult for me to handle a car , but the more i drive , the easier and more intrested . however , somepeople make their own success by doing only one way because they ususlly do it onething that they already know how to do well . in conclusion , people who try to do new thing is good .
