i strongly agree to the statement that the advertisement ( ads ) make the product much better than the actual product . the ad and promotional campaign are promoting the product to increase their sale and get enough profit but they never take the account of the consumer and it adverse effect on the user . the daily use product like toiletry and food product , their ad are so tempting that a layman just want to buy them . the ad promotes the product with all those quality which may not present . some time they make the image of the product a it ha all super quality and it is the ultimate solution of all your problem , for example the hair care product . now a day a lot people are suffering with the hair problem and the company are promoting the product that it is over night wonder and you will be changed person in 2 day or 14 day or so . but is it really true ?? people are just going on the marketing stunt and they buy it with out knowing what are the consequence and side effect of the product . i know some people who have used these dye and other hair product and now they are suffering with skin problem , which are developed coz of chemical present in these product . similarly the advertisement company which are promoting the food product . they also ignnore some concrete fact about the ingredient of the product or the quality of product . recently this truth ha been accepted by the mac donalds that they are using animal fat in preperation of so called veggy burger . also , i would like to mention aboout the recent fact that just two day back a big bread company in england ha been accused of not maintaining the standard and quality of food a some glass piece and hair are found in bread packet . thus the consumer should not just believe on the ad a they are for the benefit of the company not for the consumer . but i would not keep all ad like the promotional ad campaign run by government and some ngo and society like wwf , who , etc. in to this category . their ad are genuine and are purpose fully made for the benefit of society and noble cause . these promotional ad should be supported and publicisize .
