i disagree with the stament that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . life is becoming shorter every day . time is everything and every minute is worth a fortune . people have more thing to do , much more responsibility and activity to perform within society . work demand more every day that go by , and productivity is an every day word in our vocabulary . new invention and equipment is constantly being created to help people save time and energy . time fly and we keep flying behind it trying to catch up . a car is one of the most important invention that save u time and energy . it is the basic main of transportation in this world of instant result . regardless the fact that is also a luxury and a pleasure to some people , it 's main purpose is to take u to a specific place in the le amount of time possible . that is the basic reason why i believe that the amount of car will keep increasing in the next several year . however , i do think that the size of the car is going to change . vehicles will become smaller and more compact . so that there can be more space in the street . the car will no longer be seen a a luxury or an object of comfort but a a practical machine that save u time , just a a computer or a calculator doe . i strongly believe that the amount of car will not decrease twenty year from now , on the contrary i think the car population will increase more and more , but a car will no longer be seen a it ha been these past year . it will be a necessary instrument of our every-day life , like a toothbrush or a refrigerator . it will prevail and be even more popular . it will become smaller and more practical , more economic and le exclusive . looks will be a secondary thing while economy , space saving and good performance will be the main characteristic to be considered within the next decade . the car will stay with u a long a no other machine take it 's place .
