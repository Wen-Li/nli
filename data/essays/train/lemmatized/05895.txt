i completely disagree with the statement that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . i have three strong reason to support my opinion . demand of car are huge . it is spread worldwide and no one can now believe life exist without car . in america , i experienced we definitely need car to live especially in rural religion . to go to the supermarket , to meet my friend , to go to school even , we need car to bring u . it is impossible to walk to the station , if it is placed far from one 's house . i do not think that this situation and demand will change in twenty year , which is too early . in my country , japan , car industry is really huge to support out economy . japanese are commonly said to be good at making electorical product including car . japanese company extend not only inside of japan , but also worldwide . toyota , matsuda and mitsubishi are company producing great deal car all over the world . if there are no need to produce present number of car , these company will be in serious problem with bussiness function of my country . as a way to maintain present economy , japanese government will cooperate with company . so that people continue to buy car for long while . nowadays , i saw a great news on the television screen . it said that some american invented a new electorical car , which run faster than jaguar and produce no gas at all . it is actually a big deal now , however , because of this big news , other company ha got a neccesity of inventing one of these car . i think in a few year , it will enable to public to see electorical car in a city and ride on them . this is great opportunity for people to get along with environment of the earth . thus i think car number of car will not decrease , but car will function in other meaning . i believe
