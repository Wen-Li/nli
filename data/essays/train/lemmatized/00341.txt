i 'm agree for the statement above . because if you can study wide range of subject rather then to stick on to specific subject , your knowlege be wider and more accurate then others . i 'm actually currently taking course simmier a the first year of university student should study . soon i will finish the semister a which wa just only included core subject and sub subject for those who had n't got good grade on the past ppublic exam . but student have choice in the semister b. although student got to take core subject a well a who were taking sub subject need to contitunely taking it but also can chose two subject from elective . when i wa in high school , student just allowed to choose either bussiness or science way . every year one or two student were taking half bussiness and scince stream subject . for those did that in f.6 which had public exam . the needed subject are crashing date , time at different location . according to that some subject been missed out , so need to repeat exam or repeat the course . and yea had n't much choice for subject at there . although now im needed to follow taking core subject , but i have hope for the semister b by thinking of taking the subject i like . which wa i wanted to take experience on it since i wa at middle school . beside of taking other elective , i decided to take bussiness too . because i thought i can learn more about the bussiness and i belive i can understand it more and can learn different method from different teacher . why i 'm saying that because im currently at the local school which i 've never had expericed of it , because i wa studying in japanese school or international school in the past . i 'm beliving my self that now i have much more knowlege then in the past . i can say this to my fellow and my younger frineds , that if you guy have wide range of subject then i will encourage you to take it a much a it can , this will surely give you positive way of your style . i 'm saying that , this i had the word from my private teacher which wa `` your now a these day and the experience you had it in the really hard situation this wi ''
