i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . the academic subject are very important to every body and we need to understand many academic subject and try to apply it in our life to have good knowledge . there are many academic subject like nutrition and food science , chemistry , medicine , biology , pharmacology , histology and management which must be read about it and study it . the cademic subject will help u to understand our life and promote u to develop our life style to the best way . we have good chance in this time to reach many academic subject by internet or library or any academic centre in the world ( university or college ) . if we take different academic subject in this time we can focus on specific subject to be an expert in that subject and to take more experince . now , the world have fast change which need different science to deal with it . we need many people to take specific academic subject to solve our problem in our life . we need specific academic centre in many science . finally , each person must be take many academic subject and try to specified in specific subject .
