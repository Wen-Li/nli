i am very much helpful by this topic that successful people try new thing and try to take risk . in my view success is not a one word game , it is defined by many way at different level of life . a man got success simply is a dull man in every sence . taking new thigs at level at different part of life is a interesting phenomenon of life , i8n which a man need of interest can increase level by level . a person of a good deed always crazy about good feed . in life everybody should have position on which a person can be incharge by it own . taking risk is not showing a stupidity of a person it show that how much you careful about your life . in life there are so many situation occur where we find nothing exept blankness around ourself at that time we have no time to think on other environmet , so at time we take risk at any cost . some get feared by taking risk , but at that time they forget that daythey have to do same activity at any level of our life . many people try risk for there name and many person for reasonable activity . foe example , if a person start a business then he or she may taking risk at that program , this person ha nothig to gain at initial level of there activty , so at that time only hard work and determination proceed him up . likewise they get up wiyh new confidence at every step of there life . so we can now mention that successful person trying new thing and taking risk for there better tomorrow and there better life . if a person do well alone without trying not too much is not learn so much from there life , and that wa not include there profile at high level . thats why people need trying new thnigs .
