as it to the best way to travel , diffrent people hold different idea due to different personality and experience . personally , i do not agree with the satement that it is the best way to travel in group led by a tour guide . people agree with that statement believe that travel with group led by a quide will help them miss none of the scene site and they have someone take charge of problem . they also believe they will be benefit from tour guide since they are not familiar with the palce they plan to visit . however , i have hundres of reason and example to argue back . the most important reason support my argument is that tour guide may take you to all of the scene site bu by a very fast speed . last year , i joined a group organized by a travel agent to hangzhou for two day ' tour . the guide took u round more than fifities resort site aroung hangzhou in le than 15 hour which mean we spended no more than 20minutes for each site including laoding from big bus and rushing through the entrance and even shopping at high price . that fast speed exhausted everyone the the way to finish the assignment , no let enjoy the beautiful natural and historical view in hangzhou . moreover some tour guide take you to some shopes to encourage you spend more money on the site . most of my friend complain a lot when they buy a lot of useless under the situiations of constant persuide by their tour guide . in addition , people do not need to be worried about the un-familiar place . before i start to travel with my friend to a new place , we first collect information and print the local mapto take along . then make a plan and prepare thing for traveling like cell phone , bateries , driver liscences and some other neccessaies . travel alone or with friend ha alot of enjoyment especailly drive by car yourself . last weekend , when we drove our car from burbank to lasvegas , we ran from the morning through the rural area to un-famouse natural lake , and passed by a vast desert , at last we saw a round and big moon hanging clost to the lasvegas city . all the way , we enjoy the change of day and the nature , a well a the friendship . we drove alternatively in turn and everybody took their responsibility like a team group with no cheating and hurring . above alll the reason and example that i could not be enough to say that the best way to travel is with friend but it is definitely safe to draw the conclusion that travel in a group led by a tour guide is never could be a best way to travel
