a a human being we are getting older day by day uncounciously and most of the time unwillingly . most of the time it creates serious problem for the adult . but i believe that growing older doe n't mean that you have to lose your joy of living . i totally disagree with the belief that young people enjoy life more that the older people do . there are more reason and more possibility for a older people to enjoy life . first of all it is so obvious that young people spend their time and energy by dealing with the requirement of their social enviroment . for instance after the graduation from the high school i immediately started to study my lesson in the university . i could n't find time even to go on a vacation . moreover young people not only spend their time but also spend their energy in order to deal with the handicap that they have been facing . in contrast to them older people can save time because of their experience . they do not need to deal with those problem and they do noyt have to spend time on it . in contrast to this they can go on a vacation everytime they want . further more they seek for enjoyable time more than the youngster do . young people think that they will have time and chance to enjoy life in the future but since older people are well aware of how fast the time past . they do n't wait to do something that they really want they use their sens rather than their logic . my father ha started to deal with the garden after he retired from the court . he had worked for several year continuously . right now he know everything about planting . he know that he wo n't be able to make his dream come through if he wait longer . on the other hand i could n't find time to improve my clarinette . i believe that this is best example which suit to the dicussion about timing because i still imagine that someday i will find time to improve it . as a conclusion , i do not agree with the statement about the amount of joy that older people get from life . as i faced during my entire life older people know better how to enjoy and how to spend good time by using their experinces and sens .
