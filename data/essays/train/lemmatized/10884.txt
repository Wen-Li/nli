it is complex to clasify young people . some are really concious and helpful while other are just selfish member of society , consuming the money of their parent and wasting time . community service is now a very well recognised activity , specially by university . that 's why so many student get involved in helping others , to get point for their cv . from my point of view people who do that are really mean and unfair . it is really beatiful to say that everyone love helping the poor and the disabled , but actually not everyone like to spend their free time in treating this type of people . i do like going some weekend to the nearest home to help mentally insane people . my school organizes this actitivity , and i 've seen so many people who only went there to get point for the community service program . it is really deceiving to see this young people , sometimes your friend , standing there doinmg nothing and basically not helping , but disturbing your work . but apart from helping in home and special center , communitiy service also involves keeping clean your street , the park you visit in your free time and helping in your particular home . with this i mean not throwing garbage everywhere ( just because you think someone is going to pick it for you ) , helping your mum to make dinner or wash the dish after it , and so many other simple activity . young people do n't seem to be very interested in this activity either . they think their only obligation are to get home , do their homework and study ( even though many student do n't even follow this direction ) . in conclusion , generally young people , specially teenager , do not give enough time to helping their community . going further , the one who actually give , are expecting somekind of benefit . only a few youngster follow the pattern of `` good member of society '' , and sadly those one are considered the freak , instead of being encouraged . surely better education could change this common selfish attitude ; even though you can not make a silk purse out of a sour ear , and some people wont change in all their life .
