i agree with the proposed statement , because if people is successful , this is even because it ha been able to take risk or to do thing that are not common to other all people . in fact if we could all able to take risk , we should be all successful people . but it 's no so ! a reason for which a man try new thing could be that he want to give a support to the society in which he life , improving the life of other people ( but even the one 's ) . it return on my mind the discovery of great medical solution that have been useful to a lot of people all over the world . but every new solution or discovery could bring even a great economic fortune to it inventor : according to me , another reason could be that the inventor just would like to improve his economic condition . perhaps , i could be the first to do so ! i would like to give an example of a successful people : he is the ceo ( i.e. chief economic officier ) of an italian telecomunication industry , named 3italia . his name is vincenzo novari . i 've had the fortune to follow him during an university lecture , in which he explained about his personal success and the success of his industry . he said u that the biggest quality of 3 italia is that they try new thing : this to attract always new client , but expecially because they want to have a distinguished characteristic that they do n't want to do what the other competitor ( tim , vodafone italia and wind ) do . it seems to me a very good purpose for having success and in fact the number give reason to novari : 3italia is growing in the number of client , and the biggest part of them is happy for having this telecom .
