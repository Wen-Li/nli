companies become more and more around the country in the last few year , and the the government start globilaization between the countreis , and because of that the people have more chance to choose what product they think it better for them . the compaines pay alot of money to do a good advertisement so they people buy their product , and some of the people buy the product because it is cheep . i agree with the statement because that what the company want it to be , and they dont care if their product were very good or not . human being all what they want is to make alot of money and get a better life and they dont have think from were they got the money . the most advertisement of product is focusing in the price because that what the poeple first look at . thats not the company mistake if the people think like that , and that what the company need . if u saw an advertisement the company let you think this is the great product with le price and high quality , but when you buy it you are going to see the le price but le quality , and you cant judge the company to sale it because the didnt force you to buy their product , and they will tell you if u doesnt like it there are alot of people like our product . the big probelm is when the people see alot of advertisement they got confused because they dont really which one of the company is the right one , and alot of them they doesnt give you the high quality of the producte . what make the company still doing it because no one can stop then unless group of the people get sick fromm their food , at that time you are going to see the whole newspaper is talking about the company and what the have done .
