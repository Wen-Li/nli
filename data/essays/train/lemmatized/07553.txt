some people could have different opinion . but a far a i am concerned , `` young people enjoy more than older people do '' . there are some reason behind this philosophy . which would better explain it . first , people who are young are comparatively more healthy and spirited then older one . so , when it is talk about the enjoyment people usually enjoy more one they have no any health problem to consider . for example , older person 's generally have problem of heart , lung and other , in comparsion to younger one 's . so , here spirit about enjoyment get low . that 's turn in gloomyness . second , in certain case , enjoyment is assumed a adventure . so , it can be co-related with the life risk . and a it can be perceived that older man have more fear about the death , cause they lie at the edge of the life span , in contrary to younger one , who had longer life time . it can be inferred that , due to the fear of death , they have le diversion towards enjoyment . third , one can consider the point of responsibility . that is , young people have generally le responsibility then older and the fact is also that they are le serious about there responsibilties . so , here change in attitude occured betwwen them . a older people are more awared about there obligation . since , this could be a possible reason about there le fun in comparsion to young people . at last , it can be considered that are several reason behind this scenario , that younger have more enjoying life than older people . whether , it could be the reason of better spirit level , le fear of death , or it could be possibly about responsibility . so , these can easily support my opinion .
