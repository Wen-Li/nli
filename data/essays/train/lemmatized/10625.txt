i really do not agree with that statement . i have made a lot of travel with group and alone and i have strong reason to prefer hanging by myself . first of all , whenever you go somewhere with a group you have to move by the schedule that a tour guide or an agency already made for you . you are not free to get up at the time you want or visit other place than the expected one . so , by the end of the trip you will never know if you really knew a new place or visited touristics sight . secondly , people in group do not usually show respect for each other . what is more , they are mainly formed by an agency than by particular interest . in this way , you are forced to hang around with people you might not choose to be specially a close friend . you have to wait , for example , to those who are always late and you lose time you have already paid on those waiting , besides your conversation never grow in deepness . i think travelling alone is much better . first of all , specially if you are on your holiday , you do not have to share or discus your desitions with anybody . it happens to me last year , when i wa on a group journey , that we were always arguing about what place to visit or even what to eat . on holiday , your are so tired of the whole year that arguing with someone exhaustes more than relaxes . thus , i like visiting place that most of the tourist not , for example museum , old building and cultural centre . why should i spend my time visiting place i am not interested in or discussing my preference with person i know will not share them ?
