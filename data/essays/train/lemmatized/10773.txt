i think is good if you can have knowledge of many subject , but today , if you want to be effective and competitive , you should specialize in one specific subject . the problem is the following : nowaday the knowledge ha been increased a lot and this proccess go on . in example , the natural science is increasing the knowledge day to day and there are a lot of information about complicated proccess a dna replication that year ago did not seem possible to discover easily . on the other hand , the specific knowledge ha a great problem . when a person is more especific can lose capacity to analize minor problem . it is probably that the people with specific knoledge would try explain all the problem under their vision . in example , a doctor who work with pshycology , probably he would try to explain a lot of case trougth the pshycology . therefore , i think that the best position is support the two type of knowledge . the government should care that people in their country have the opportunity to choose both thing and the government could manage how many people take place in one or another possibility trougth policy and fellowship for student . the final objective is that the country will have proffessional people in both area and each area will have their function . in that case , the specific area provide knowledge to general area when this need it . in example , a group of research discover a new medicine and they should give the medicine to doctor who work with the patient . in conclusion , both type of knowledge ( general and specific ) are neccessaries to support the science advance ( the increase of the knowledge ) and the normal life ( the solution to the common problem ) .
