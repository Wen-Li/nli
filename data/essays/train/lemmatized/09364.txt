i do agree with the statement that it 's better to understand concept than to learn fact . infact i think that it is n't important to learn event , try to remember them without comprehend them , what you learn ha not to be a mixture of information but you need to know cause and explanation of them . for example i can report my personal experience : when i studied at the high school i did n't go on very well with my history teacher because we had differen opinion about this same topic . she believed that student must know everithing happened in the past , battle , important people 's life , date etc . on the countrary i thought , and i still think , that it is not so important to learn so many information , i 'm interested in cause , in important event , not in detail : i believe that if you focus too much on detail you will lost the main idea . it is also important to say that it 's hard to remember fact while it 's easier to remember idea and concept which are related with themselves and wich have particular cause and effect . some yea ago i took a course about technique of memory and i learned that to remember something you need to relate it with some other thing . in my experience at school i had the opportunity to verify that it wa a true statement ! i also think that idea and conceps can be more utile in life than the kowledge of a particular fact , it is rare that you will need to know a particular fact in the future . what is important to say is that when you understand concept you understand also a way of thinking , of providing argument to support a thesis . to understand idea and a way of thinking is much more important than knowing three million information or event : you wo n't need to know information or event if you ca n't relate them .
