advertisement is the motor for each company , it is like a front screen for it product . but sometimes company may lie and give wrong information about the producuct . when you turn on a television , the first thing you see is advertisement . befor every event , the thing that influence you is advertisement . but do we know what is it ? how true is this information ? each company try to have the best product , get more money , but they do not want to spend dollar to reach that goal . when a product is not well know or customer do not like it , the company change that by advertisement specially an attractive one that can influence customer and push them to buy it . nowadays , most of people do not trust them . because you can see an advertisement for a product saying that it can help you to sleep , but when you try it it doe not change nothing . just lie . so more people lost their confidence on publicity , and prefer to stay with one product that they are sure is efficient and will never change it . i had my own experience with it . few month ago , i saw an advertisement for a new kind of food , saying is so delicious , new combination , and a lot of others good thing . i wa so influenced , that pushed me to try it . but unfortuntly , i wa disapointed . it taste horrible . when a company make advertisement , they always show the good side and never what is wrond with the product . this method wa helpfull few year ago when people thougth that everything they saw wa true . but not any more , people try to be sure what they are buying , and ask about it befor getting it . sometimes , people get influenced by what they are watching . companies make new idea such a always get a funny advertisement about care , have sexy girl in man 's product , and child for candy and food . they also focus on special generation commontly kid because of theire innocence . however , company make to influence people , the truth is the best way to do it . as long there are liers , there is correct person .
