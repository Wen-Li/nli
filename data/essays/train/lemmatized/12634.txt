the statement refers to the difference between understanding and illustrating . i partly agree with this statement . being able to analyse a well a understand idea and concept is a crucial part of academic achievement . understanding concept do not only confers student the ability to analize a situation but also to adapt this concept to other context . indeed , the role of a concept is to provide a broad base of understanding . this intellectual exercise is part of the process that enable the student to switch from theoretical consideration to practical consideration . this process is possible only through the concept . consequently i think that we should consider concept a more important regarding the fact that they are part of a constructive process . we have seen above than the concept is a precious tool for the understanding process . however , this tool must first be understood in itself . and at this stage , factual element remain crucial . a concept is reliable only if it is illustrated by fact . therefore , i consider a also important that student learn fact because it represents the only way to understand concept . for example , a concept ha no value without a broad factual basis . therefore , fact are important too for student . as a conclusion , i would say that understanding concept is more important for student a a way to be able to analyse a situation . however , factual element seem crutial a a way to understand concept . my consideration on the comparative importance of the two element would be to consider them a part of a unique process . thus , considering concept without any reference to factual element seems useless . also , considering fact without joining it with concept make any global operative approach imposssible .
