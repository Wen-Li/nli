all day we take car to go at work , take train to transfer from a city to another , buy various type of electronic machine , on all of this action we can watch a million of danger situation ! on the train we can read uppon the window that is very danderous put out the head or put out bottle , during drive car we can watch many traffic signal that remember the maximum speed permitted , or finally when we buy a washing-machine we can read the book where are write all instruction to what do and what do not . this are the advertisement that daily we can find in the life . just when we are child , parent show what is dangerous for u , `` do not touch this '' is the mainly phrase that it is said . during the grow each child decide what is right for him and , sometime to follow the fashion , make bad decision for himself like smoching cigarette and joint , or go around with not very good people . sometimes an advertisement could seem very eccessive , like how do not put a cat in the microwave , but not all people are able to think what is right and what is not . i think that it is impossible know whether a person is able to choose the true way to make somethingh , and so it is better if other write sample instruction for him \ her . finally i definitely disagree the statement because we can not know when and what is really dangerous for u , and so i think that is better follow the instruction .
