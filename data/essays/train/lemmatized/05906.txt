no body can deny that advertisement are very usefull and important for u nowadays because it help u to know about the new product and which are good and which are bad . some advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . in fact , i disagree with that the advertisment cheat the customer and tell them that product are usefull and they are not for many reason . fist , this advertisment make me spend my money in wronge way instead of tell me he truth and help me buy appropriate thing . if i am poor man and see by the tv or radio that product are usefull , i will buy it and if it is not good i waste my money and can not buy what is usefull for me . in addition to that , this kind of advertisment effect the good product because when the customer see the bad product is better than good productm , he will buy the bad product and do not buy the good product , so the company will be lose their money although it product is the best . furthermore , they will encourge bad company to produce the bad product because they know that if they advertise for their product well , they will not lose any thing but they will collect a lot of money which lead to encourge people to cheat and be dishonest in their society . moreover , when the people know the truth about this company of advertisemnt , they wil lose their credability with people and will not trust them any more . in uae there is company which do this for some product because the company of this product give it a lot of money but when the people know the truth they told the authority and they close this company . finally in my opinion , the company of advertisement should tell the people the truth and work to help them not to cheat them and then they will have alot of money for sure because all people kmow that this company work for people and know their credability .
