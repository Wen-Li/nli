young people time is gold . although young people care about and are worried about it , time is not sufficient for them , while they have to do lot of thing : study for their major , learning a foreign language , part-time job . .. i am focusing on those young student that are at the university , and that they are completely dedicated to their major . due to the fact that they are student they have to be more concetrated on preparing their major and prepare themselves to be better off , time for communiy activity is not a that much important . but it all depend on what sort of activity are we talking about . for example , working with non-gubernamental organization , charity , is totally different from others . with this kind of activity you can become more mature and have a different perspective in life . having these experience may help you in your future , thinking that there are some others that need more help than you . what is more , this activity might be coordinated with your own and primary activity ( going to the university ) and sometimes it is not very easy . i have a friend that is working a a volunteer in a charity , teaching people with physical disease how to cook on tuesday and thursday . he love it , but when he is in mid-term exam is impossible for him to attend this kind of course , because he need to focus all his time and energy in the subject he ha to prepare . in conlcusion , it is true that young people do not dedicate time to help their community but they have good reason to explain and demostrate why the ca n't . maybe young people should reconsider the option of helping the others and make an effort to do it , but it 's still young peope decision .
