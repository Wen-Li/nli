in 20 years , there will be fewer car in use than there are today with the constant advancement of technology in our world today , many solution to problem we face today can be solved . certain issue that can be seen to have always been discussed and debated over , time after time can probably come to an end . through advancement of technology and the convenience that car seem to have brought to human being , it came hand in hand with a number of issue that are widely discussed today . first of all , there is the pollution issue that rise or decline with the usage of car . next , there is the depletion of scarce resource that we use to fuel our car . last but not least , is the cost of purchasing a car and the gas to fuel it . it is because of these issue , that there is a high chance that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . pollution contributes to the usage rate of car within a country . take bangkok , a city that is polluted and notorious for it traffic jam a an example . people living in bangkok are probably immune to the amount of pollution that they breathe and interact with everyday . tourists however , are a different story in term of the pollution rate in thailand . some complain of bad skin , some claim of constant cough , some complain on blurred vision with the amount of smoke on the street . when the pollution rate of a city is so high , there will be a reduction in the amount of car that are used . the government will most probably bring out policy that control the amount of car through mean of indirect tax on car and the amount of road that they allow to pas through at a given time period . in this case , it would just be convenient for people to travel through mode of public transportation . when there are tax on car , lesser people will purchase car , and for convenience purpose , more will use public transportation . thereby , reducing the amount of car that are being bought and driven on a daily basis . following that would be the depletion of scarce resource of gas . the escalating oil price have made headline more than once in any form of mass medium worldwide . the thai government had subsidized the oil price from rising in thailand for quite a while , and this allow the thais to continue their transportation a they wish . however , after the thai government ceased to subsidize the oil price , did public mode of transportation like the subway become overcrowded . with the gradual depletion of scarce resource like that of oil that fuel the car in which we drive in , the cost for the scarce resource will rise . when a price of a good rise , this will discourage the consumer from purchasing such a product . it can be seen that oil fuel car , so without fuel for car , there will be adequate reason to purchase or use more car . in this case , the amount of car that are used today and in twenty year time will most likely have decreased substantially . last but not least is the better alternative that our technology is coming up with . on a day-to-day basis , there are advancement of technology seen everywhere . even after the rising gas cost , country turned to alternative of gas . in a few year of course , it can most probably be assumed that gas will run out so another alternative will have to be thought of . now with the convenience of public transportation in the sense that it is more efficient , le time consuming and cheaper in term of gas and maintainence price of the car . most people will be turning to public mode of transportation a opposed to private mode of transportation in travelling in car . more and more people are becoming educated , and this ha increased in the awareness of the environment . people will then try to reduce the amount of pollution by using le of product that produce pollution by finding other alternative like that of using public mode of transportation . in this case , because car produce a significant amount of pollution to our world , the amount of car purchase will have decreased quite a deal . hence , it can probably be seen and assumed that within 20 year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . with escalating oil cost and pollution , gradual depletion of scarce resource , better technology that can come up with alternative and enivornmental friendly people , the amount of car that will be purchased in the next few year will be gradually declining . therefore , it can be assumed that in 20 year time , there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
