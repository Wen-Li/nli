indeed i disagree that young people enjoy their life more than old people because i believe that old people have more time to enjoy themselves , have le responsibility and have a good life experience and resource which they can use to enjoy themselves . old people usually have much time for enjoyement . they are almost retired after they finished their work time and so they will concentrate on enjoying theirselves through travelling abroad or did their own favorite hobby like reading , painting , etc . .. other important thing which enable elderly to enjoy their life is the fact that they are free . they have no much responsibility to do . they are already retired from work so they will not care about their bos or their duty . their kid are independent now so they will not worry about them . all these factor give old people time and chance to enjoy themselves and not anything else . the life experience and knowledge usually old people gained from their long enrollement in work , reading and dealing with people will surely offer them the capability to enjoy their time . they know most place which worth visiting . they know how to choose their friend and peer , and they can deal with any problem might face them . in addition to that old people might collect much more money than young did , so they can use their money in enjoyment . in conclusion , i believe that old people can enjoy their life much better than young people do , this is because old people have more time and money , got better experience , and lastly they are free from responsibility which the younge people have .
