to predict what will happen in twenty year from now is a hard thing to do . however , i must say that i disagree with the statement that state that in twenty year there will be fewer car then there are today . i disagree for many reason i find reasonable . everyday our world change in a way or another . we experience change in the world and those change can affect u in various way . because the world ha changed radically over the past hundred year more job are provided and more people are getting really involved with this development . as a result , speed became a very important matter in an individual 's life . since , more work is needed to be accomplished by an individual now than it probably wa before and in a shorter amount of time , an individual might find himself or herself in need for shortcut and method than make his or her life easier . when we go to our job or school or anywhere else we usually try to save time and reach there a quickly a possible . the most popular method of doing that is driving a vehicle or being driven in a vehicle . more and more people are finding themselves in great need of a car . in some family , more than just one car is neccessary . so , if you go into a house of a family consisting of six member for example , you will most probably find two car or even more . in some family both the parent could have job and therefore , each one of them need his or her own car . another reason is that people have more chance of buying a car or even more today , which is because so many car company make it easy for customer . those company allow customer to pay only a part of the price of a car throughout a specified period of time . with people getting busier by the day and chance of buying a car increasing , and speed becoming such a vital thing , i believe that in the next twenty year car will not only not decrease , but they will increase and the number of car will sore .
