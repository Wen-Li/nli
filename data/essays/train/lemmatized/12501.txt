have you ever bought a product what you do not need ? i believe evrybody ha the experience at least one time . what make you buy some product what is not necceray for you ? the answer is an advertisement . i agree that most advertisement make product look much better than they are so that people are temtated by those . there are three way that advertisement make their product seems much better . those are exaggerating , using famouse person , and hiding an important information . first of all , most advertisement hire cerebities to make misunderstanding costomers like that the cerebities are actually using the productucts . you can see almost cosmetic product advertisments ha a beautiful feamale movie star in it . of course the woman ha really great skin . she might use the product or not . however , most customer think if they use the product , they can have a beautiful skin like the ceerebity ha . secondly , most edvertisements exaggerate their product . for exsample , many toy advertisement show their product are moving automatically without any human control . as a result , a lot of child are temtated by the toy incredible moving , and keep asking to their parent to buy the toy . then the parentes ' saying that the toy are not robot ; you have to control yourself to childeren doe not work at all . the avdertisements use childrent 's pure mind to sell their product . finally , advertisement tend to hide some very important information with small character . for exsample , you can easily find a very tiny information right bottom of tv screen that usually telling very important infomation that you might change your mind . in summary , i understand that the purpose of advertisement is maximising the selling product . however , their exaggerating , hiding some information , and making misunderstnading can make people to buy what they do not need .
