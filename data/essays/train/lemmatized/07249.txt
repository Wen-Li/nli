whether having broad knowledge of many topic is better than specializing in an specific one is not an easy question , and often , not even our choice , since it 's determined by our education . even though it 's an issue applicable to all field in life , i 'll narrow it down to a professional point of view , and how being a very specialized person can be very positive at work , but can also significantly damage your career path . the best way to start the discussion is by illustrating the issue with an example which i 'm relatively familiar with . there are many company currently developing new mobile phone network , which result in an enormous investment in highly qualify telecom engineer . the market value of an experienced engineer in `` 3g '' network deployment can be measured in term of hundred of thousand of dollar . the learning and development opportunity , a well a the earning potential , are very attractive . on the other hand , there are other telecom professional who rather have a slower progression by broadening their knowledge . `` in order to be prepared for the future change , it 's better to know a bit of everything '' , would be their milestone . they may not be so successful in 3 year time , but when the development of the new technology start to die off , the knowledge and expertise they 've acquired in other field will open them door that wo n't be available for those who specialised in that one specific subject , which is no longer `` fashionable '' . these advantage and drawback can be extended to all aspect of life . a case that will sound familiar to everyone is that smart member of our family who can talk about everything , but when you ask him for deeper detail on certain topic , can only give vague response . this is one of many example that can be found in real life . as i said at the beginning , having a very broad range of knowledge is often dictated by our education to a certain extent ; but we 'll always have the option to specialize in a more specific topic , or guide our knowledge to a more open and general approach , by spending a long a we possibly can studying about it .
