it is controvertial whether in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . some people disagree with the idea that it is impossible to reduce using car because today we are so depend on car . however , in my opinion , i agree with the idea that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use that there are today . first , in reality , now , we are faced with the lach of oil or any fuel . second , by developing the technique of science , we may invent more innovative transportation to go to all around the world . to begin with , now , there is state of lacking the any fuel . we effort steadily to find new fuel like hydrogen dioxide fuel , nuclear energy and wind power energy . however , these could not be replace of oil fuel . also , in the world , there were still war to have the fuel priority . according to the korean broadcast in seoul , in the 50 year , there were no fuel resource in the world . in this sense , car which depend on fuel could not be used in 20 year . next , getting development in science , our scientist would invent a lot of innovative transportation . maybe , a we seen in `` matrix - which deal with the future - , that situation would be coming . people could move in just second a the girl in matrix and could move using machine like rocket . in addition , we could be fly in the sky . if the scientist can make up the circumstance which doe not have gravitional force , we could move freely the side to anothe side . this is not familiar with me , now , however , in 20 year , we do n't know what happens are occur . this clearly show that in 20 year we could use another transportaion . in conclusion . i agree with the idea that in 20 year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for the reason that i mentioned above . first is lack of fuel and second is our scientist could invent more convenient transportation machine .
