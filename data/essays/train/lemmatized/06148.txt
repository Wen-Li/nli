i agree to the statement , that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them learn fact . first of all , the motivation of learning should be to know the thing , to fulfill the thirst of knowledge . this ambition should be the reason , why somebody decides to study at an university . second , if somebody learns only fact , it will be even harder to keep the fact . the human memory ha evolved by nature in order to better survive on this planet . at these time it wa helpful to understand idea and concept , for example , understanding nature in favour to use it . therefore the human is not suited to learn fact , in comparison to the computer . it could be asked , why student have to learn fact at all ? the reason is simple . facts are needed to be present in the mind to construct or to follow a theory a much a brick and stone are needed to construct an house . if student don `` t learn any fact , they can '' t follow any theory , which rely on fact . therefore it is neccessary to learn fact , but the motivation for it should be to understand idea and concept . learning fact ha to be viewed like a tool , which some people like to use and some people don `` t , but the reason to use the tool doesn '' t lie in the tool itself . as i described above , the human mind is not intended to learn fact . but to develop a complicated theory , it is neccessary to know fact . therefore the society created reward for using learning fact . a teacher reward a student , if he learns well and if he learns fact accurately . some student are attracted so much by these reward , that they only learn fact to achieve the reward . everybody of u experienced them in the school class , where some pupil learned very ambitiously and accurately , but it wa easy to see , that they prefered receiving the reward instead of satisfying their thirst of knowledge . as a solution to this phenomenon at school , i propose to reward the understanding of idea and concept much more then just learning the fact . the pupil need the discipline to the learn fact , but they also need to see , why the are learning them .
