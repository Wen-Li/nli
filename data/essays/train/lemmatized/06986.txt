in twenty year , will there be fewer car in use than there are today ? i think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . it is true that car are significantly important a transportation way for middle distance , and the middle-distance transportation will become more important because we need communication and transaction with those who live place where are far from the place where we live in . however , for two reason , i think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the first reason is the increasing of substitutional transportation way and the second reason is that the long-distance transportation becomes more impotant than the middle-distance transporation . first , it is true that middle-distance transportation becomes more important . however , way of middle-distance transportation are not only car . for example , bus are in use for middle-distance transportation . recently , we pay attention to the negative effect of car on environment because gas which are issued by car are said to have effect which make the atomosphere warmer . therefore , the movement occurs that we use bus instead of my car in order to reduce car which are in use at the same time . when we consider this trend , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . second , although i think that middle-distance transportation becomes more important , long-distance transportation must become more important than middle-distance transportation , since the necessity of long-distance transportation because information technology allows u to find new infomation about the overseas and to encourage u to go abroad . therefore , although middle-distance transportation may become more important , international transportation becomes important than this . and , if international transportation is more importatnt relatively and expenditure by people remains unchanged , people reduces the expenditure for middle-distance , there are fewer car in use than there are today . for the above two reason , i think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . however , this doe not imply that car are le important than today ; i mean that long-distance transportation is by far more important than middle-distance transportation and way for middle-distance transportation change .
