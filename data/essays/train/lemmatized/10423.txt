nowadays , elder people think that young people doe not give enough time to help their community . it is true that yonug people seems to concenturate more on their own concern . however , their are still lot of other young people who love to help their community and voluntier for hard social work . first of all , in case of korea , young student are anticipating for voluntiary work for 40 hour per year . even tough it is kind of an school homework , every student are helping their community by visiting old people who doesnt have any relative , or orphanage and some of them really feel pleased to help them . fortheremore , in korea , when student attend university they try to participate more actively because they can have more free time than before . not everybody but lot of my feriends are voluntiering to teach elementary to high school student who are not available to have a tutor without receiving money . some of them also visit elder person who are lonly to talk with them persistently . it is true that some young people seems to think only themself but their are still lot of young people how are helping their community . it is dangerous to overlead all the young people is selfish .
