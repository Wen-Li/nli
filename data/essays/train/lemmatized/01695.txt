i 'm from a coutry in which history is more than millenary , and it is absolutely true and right that 's always useful and needed to learn from the past to look up to the future , but in my personal life and experience i 've always found that the fact itself ca n't stick permanently in to our memory ( but this may be because i 'm not a huge fan of history too ! ) , more often it 's the exact contrary , we kind of filter what the fact wa trough our sens and what most ha captured our attention on the matter . if nothing ha captured our attention it 's more than probable that we wo n't remember it for a much time a needed for the growth of a critical mind . i 've often been in the situation of having to choose between formation and information ( where for information i mean thetwo or three pointer that can help me in a short time , but wo n't leave me nothing for the future ) . well , i 've attended classical study in high school and one of my professor , who ha been a real menthor for most of our class , used to say that school ha the primary objective to form people , not to inform them , and it can be done only by giving the instrument and possibility to approach a new fact with a proper critical sense . in other word the student deserve to think with their own mind , preferably open mind . it ha to be assured to them the possibility to dig under the fact , understand it 's logic , by analyzing it from different point of view , discus it , in a certain sense make it of proper own , infer the essential content andthen desume a lesson for the future . all in all if we want people thinking with their own mind we have to give them the right instrument and focus , so it 's way better to understand t
