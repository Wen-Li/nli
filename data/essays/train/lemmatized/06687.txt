i agree with this statement becouse a succefful person want always to increase own experience doing something different a what it usually do . moreover doing different thing could take certain risk , and a successful person know that but it is n't worried becouse he want only to improve itself and it experience . moreover a successful person is n't worried to be judged by the others becouse it is very determinate . the are a lot of risk such a to fail , but i do n't think it 's important . obviously trying new thing is possible when you are young and you have much energy and willpower , when you are older you do n't want to do and you are not able to do such experience . for exemple a friend of mine is english and she came in italy when we wa 13 . she decided not to study only english a foreign language at school but she studied also french . she wa n't good in french and even if she usually took bad mark she rappreents a life model for me . she allways advice me to try with new thing and not to fear about them . i have followed her advice when i moved from my small village to milan . i would have had the opportunity to work in my parent 's factory if i had stayed there but i decided to study design in milan and to be self-supporting . an experience like this make oneself feel more mature and responsable even if it 's a bad experience .
