it is possible to use fewer car than we use today ? can we stop ussing the car ? there are two different answer for these question , yes or no . in one hand we can say that in twenty year we will use le the car because it will come a day in which every road , every city and every country will be colapsed because of the car . it will be so full of car that i am sure that the air will be black because of the polution . there are more cause that we can say that argue this idea , car consume a lot of petrol and petrol is not eternal , so they we have to invent new car model without the necesity of using petrol . i am sure that they will invent them but not in twenty year now . in the other hand we have that we will use more car than the one we use now , could this be possible ? yes . nowadays the medium is to have more than one car for each person , something really hard to believe , because , how want more than one car ? i do not know but it is the truth . if we still buying more than one car , or if we buy only one car for each person , definately , in twenty year we will use more car than we do today . i have to say that i fell like fear if i start to think this because we could not go anywhere anyway , i mean , there will be so many car that we could not go by car because it will bw colapsed , and we could not go walking because it will be poluted , so what can we do ? the main problem is that we have not got any solution . we can not oblige anybody not to go by car and go walking , but we can try to use the car a le a possible , for example , going four only in one car instead of going in four car or something like that . to conclude , i have to said that we have to find solution to this problem if we want to live in a place with pure air and without a lot of noise and accident , using le the car will cause le accident .
