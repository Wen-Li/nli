i disagree with the idea that the number of the car in use will decline in two decade . there are two reason for this : convinience and necessity . first , car are really convinient . it enables you to carry a lot of thing when you go shopping and to go many sight like seaside area . recent survey show that two third of family in rural area of japan have their own car to parchase thing , go to work and so on . this fact illustrates that car are necessary for these people . this trend is not going to be changed in twenty year a long a rural area exist . moreover , car are demanded even in city area . you can see much traffic jam in tokyo , osaka . and nagoya . so , people will continue to enjoy the convinience of the car . the second reason is that car are necessary for developing country and country which have big soil . cars play an important role to develop a country . for example , thing which is used to make hauses must be transported by car . big country ca n't make train rail
