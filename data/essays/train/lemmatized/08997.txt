i agree with that idea . i think successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . let me give an example from real life , for instance edison he explored very useful thing for human that is lumb . before he explored it he did 99 experiment and at the end of he found lamb . he took a risk also he could stop but he didnt and finally at his 100 experiment he found it . i point out at this essay about taking a risk but also trying new thing is so important to become success . if you wanna improve yourself you should open to new thing . when we see the history every community that they dont wanna change is cleaned from history and the new one come to their place . if we handle a ataturk he tried to change the goverment and he became successful at that point if he didnt encourge that and he didnt take risk maybe in turkey democratic goverment wouldnt established and we become like other poor country . also we can give scientist a an example cause they try to make new thing to useful for human and take risk for this aim . if they wouldnt like that human live like an animal and pre-historical age . they invent most thing by this way and we improve ourself and increas our life standard .
