in my opinion , most advertisement should not make product seem much better that they really are . this is because , it will be more confusing , and the consumer will be disappointed . if the advertisement are much better that real product , it is same a the company told a lie . i you bought the product affected by the advertisement , you feel the product are different from the product which were shown by the advertisement . therefore , the product actually differ , and the advertisement , in fact the company , must be fake . if the avobe situation wa happened , what are you going to feel ? i think probably you get upset . this is because the product which you bought are worse than the product which were shown by the advertisement . so you must feel the company are liers . i have an example of such situation . one day , i bought the elextronic souces , and the advertisement of the product showed `` the electronic souces are keeped for 1 year '' . i looked the sentence before i bought , and also i decided buying it from the sentence . at first , the electronic souces worked comfortably . however , about 1 month later , the elecronic souces did not work , it meant the product became empty . in fact , the product wa not keeped for 1 year , it wa only keeped for 1 month . then , of course i got upset , because the advertisement wa a lie . in conclusion , when the company make the advertisement , they should not show the product much better than real product , because it is absolutely a lie .
