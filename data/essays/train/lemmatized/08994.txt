we can see that nowadays young peaple do not give enough time to helping their community . nowadays the lifestyle of young people is very different than earlier . indeed with the emerging of capitalism young people are le concern by their community , they learn to be more individualist . also with the emerging of new technology , youmg people are le interesting about their community and they prefer playing video game , go out with friend . an important point is that we live in an individualist society , i mean a capitalist society where people are not intest about others and where religion take le place than before , people meet le togather around ceremony or thimg like that . moreover people travel more and more and are often far away from their familly . the communitie spirit disappear slowly to let palce to individualism . i think one of the more important reason why young people doe not give enough time to helping their community is the role of the familly . indeed the familly do not have the same role then before , for exemple few parent stay married nowadays , woman and men work hard , young people are often between father and mother and are more and more abandonned by parent , it mean that parent do not have enough time to learn to their child to give time to their community . therefore young peaple are alone at home , in front of tv or in front of computer and use all their free time in watching tv and in playing video game . i think the community spirit disappears to let place to the individualism but only in developped country , we can see that in emerging country the community spirit is still important , the man is le individualist and young people are more concerned by their community .
