nowadays when you are in the street , the first thing you can notice is the amount of car that each day collapse the road of the city since the first minute early in the morning . the fact of seeing hundred of car in the street depends on the country you are , and the city in that certain country too , a not all the city have the same traffic level . here in spain , you can easily notice the difference when you travel to madrid and when you come to my city , burgos . in madrid it is nearly impossible to go out by car whereas in burgos you do not usually have problem with the traffic . from my humble point of view , i think that people is becoming in gerenal very lazy when having to choose whether to use the car or not . in madrid , i would not use the car because it is obvious that you arrive everywhere before if you go by bus or underground . in the other hand , in a small city like burgos it is healthier to go by bus or even walking a distance are very short . it might sound extrange after having said this but , i do have driving licence although i don ' t have a car but i hope not to become an obsesed girl with my car in the future and not to use it unless it is neccessary . due to this lazy society that we are creating and the fact that we are all the time improving the car , which make people more interested in them , i think that in the future we wo n't be able to solve this problem . if nowadays we disagree with the number of car that we are seeing each day , i think that this is nothing compared with the amount of them that each day are going to appear for example in twenty year time . in the end , i would like to add that by the contrary , i think that we will have to assume it a it is part of the evolution and developpment of our industry and tecnology .
