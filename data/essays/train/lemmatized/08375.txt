i belive that is very nessesary to travel in a group but not lead by a tour guide . if you travel in a group let say may up with personal friend , you normally want to explore by your own , without having so mone leading you . this way you woukdnt have any problem in wanting to go some where else or wanting to just having fun . in a personal experience not very long ago , i went with a group of friend to paris . we went by owr own . we had a graet time , we did n't learn u much u people would by a tour guide but we had a chance to explore evreything , by reading asking or even thinking by owr own mind . another group that went but with a tour guide , said that it wa n't that great , for a matter afact , they even came earlier because they whre sik of listening about the histry of all the rock , church , house , etc . they said that it wa just like a class back at home . and because he wa already paid by their parent they could n't get ride of him . another reason why tour guide are so boring , and is much better to go in a group , is because they want you to see everything . thheir is no time to waist . this take charge of evrything , time to wake up , division time , etc . iam not just saying this , i know about this . my mom who ca n't go anywhere without a tour guide always hire one for owr trip , and lety me tell you , at taht time i wish i wa back at school , and iam not over reacting . i defenetly belive that you should just travel with a group and forget the tour guide , i can ashore that you will learn u much and a great time , expect for tho people , like my mother , who ca n't go anywhere without a tour guide , if she would expirence just the group trvavel i bet she would swich . i know that i will never hire a tour guide to show me around with a group .
