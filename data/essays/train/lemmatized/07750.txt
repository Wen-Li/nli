in my opinion it is very important to have broad knowledge of many academic subject and , in the mean time be specialized in one specific subect . i believe that there are a lot of thing that must be known by everybody . i think that what we learn at school must be the most diversified a possible . we need to study a lot of subject and read many different critic to be able to better understand the people and the society we live in . only by having a very wide knowledge we can understand what we really like and consequentally began to study a specific subject which can help u to work in the right way everyday . i belive that a lot of subject are linked together and required the study of other subject to develop a complet and good idea on a topic . for example while studying a foreign language i think it is important to study the culture , the geography , the literature and the economy of all the countriesa where that language is spoken . in this case it would be important to study sociolagy , geography and economics in addition to that foreign language grammar . only by having such a developed knowledge we would really be able to say that we know a foreign language otherwise everytime we go to that specific country we would not know anything about it and we would feel unusefull and ignorante . i also belive that a broad knowledge is important in everyday life . for example how could we be able to read an economic article on a newspaper without knowing the basic of economics ? according to all that i said i believe that a broad knowledge is a need that each person feel inside and it is something that need to be develloped and extended everyday by reading book or article a well a by watching documentary on television .
