some people keep enjoying , sometimes indulging , their youth . they believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do . so they have to consume their limited youth for enjoyment . i have to say such idea is inappropriate since enjoying life is not a previliege of young people . there are many type of enjoying your life , no matter you are young or older . everyone , at any age , can find his or her way of enjoyment . young people are physically energetic so that they can climb moutains , play internet game , play basketball and disco dance . older people can travel in more peaceful way like trip on a cruiser , playing chess and gathering to watch basketball match . some enjoyment are just mission impossible for young people in the sake of age . family gathering , marriage and retirement are just patent for older people . imagine that sitting arounded by child and even grantchildren and enjoying a candle family dinner ? children certainly can enjoy much from it . meanwhile older people enjoy with another kind of happiness . they may even enjoy more than others because of more memory of the family . sometimes , financial condition may also provides older people better chance than young to enjoy the life . owning a dream house is just a dream in short term for young people unless they got a sudden fortune . with more money after many year of saving , older people can enjoy having a house , having baby , gardening the backyard . generally , no matter your age , or even gendar , career , etc. , different people always can have different option to enjoy life . this is variety and colorfulness of life .
