i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i bought a food with looking nice picture last week . even though , when i cooked a exactly what the direction say , it looked defferent and it wa not very nice . those kind of thing should have happeded to most people . i understand that they are doing business and they are trying to get more customer and sell the product . however , i do n't thing they should make advertisement make product seem better than they really are for three reason . first , it make people who bought the product disapointted . the light used in the picture on the advertisement and angle can make the product look better . in addition , if the customer did not like the real product , they wasted their money . it is like cheating and not fair . finally , the company might be complained by the customer . the customer will not buy the same product if they are disapointted by the product which were showed nicer than they really are . the product wil be popular only the begining and the profit will not get any better or get worse . people are happy and dreaming when they are looking at the advertisement . it is true that nice looking advertisement make people feel good . although , people get more desapointted and sad if the difference is so big . nice and beautiful advertisement give people dream but if it is not true , it is cheating . it is not good to show not real look .
