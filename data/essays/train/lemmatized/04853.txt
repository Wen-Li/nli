if most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ? i would say probably yes , because that is the aim of advertisement itself . all profession have a reason for being . lawyers try to avoid or solve conflict between two or more party . doctors try to cure sick people and prevent their pacients of getting ill . teachers educate and teach their studentes . so what do professional in the advertisement area do ? they try to raise the sell of their client product . in order to convince a group of the population to buy a certain product , you have to give them reason to do so . on the first place the publicist define a certain target group for the product they want to sell : male or female , teenager or grown ups , professional woman or housewife , and so on . once they have a certain group of possible buyer , they have to enhance the benefit of the item for that party of the population . telling someone the negative consecuences of something is not a good marketing . so they just tell the possible consumer about the great advantage of using this product , making only reference to the pro 's and leaving out the con 's . an advertisement will probably mention how much better or efficient than other company ' product this item solves a certain issue or conflict . making a difference , that is one of the keystone . also , an advertisment generally try to enhance all the improvement the use of this product will do in one 's life , not only on the purpose of itself but also in a broader way . using a certain milk product will suddenly not only be better because of the calcium in the milk , it will also make you look healthier and younger , have a better skin , and - why not - find a boyfriend or enjoy more the time with your child . these are the way advertisment work and reach the people : directed to the right group of consumer , mentioning only the benefit and enhancing those a good a possible , and then putting those consecuences into a larger picture . that 's why advertisement make a product seem much better than it really is , because that 's what it 's supposed to do .
