im fully agree with the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . it 's true because most of young people is so busy to helping out their community rather than adult people , specially in korea , they actually live with many complicated thing for instance school , and after school they most go to the campus , and study , they should go to the college at all . i think they do n't even have their private time to spend . but the valius way , of course they have to concern with it , that may belongs to education . their definitly busy , but if in their heart , if there a little concern with community , they 'll help community by themselves . however the young people of this century is not that nice actually . it up to themselves but ; in my experience , they used to think about their friend and what they like to do . i meant , it just like an child who do n't concern the future . for develpmental of good thing is up to how do they think about it . of course somes tends to negative but somes are not . and im not sure few people would like to dedicate their good for the community . thus , this problem will be better a much a inhavitants mind are grow . however , most of young people would n't like to do something for the community , is the truth , but i hope it will be better .
