i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . people usually buy for looking the product which have good looking shape . the customer can not test the product before using it except special event , so the people who make the advertisement pay attention about making good and charming advertisement . these are the specific reason what i agree with the statement first , customer want to be a model who show in the advertisement . everybody want to be a nice guy or a beautiful woman instead of being ugly people . as a result , the people who make the advertisesements make this kind of advertisement . for example , if the tv show very charming hair shampoo advertisement , the model in the advertisement ha very beautiful blond straight hair , it blow by the wind and it look really nice . if i have think , curly black hair , i can not be a a woman who are in the advertisement . second , customer do not know it value exactly . just to see an advertisement , the customer never know about it value , since they never tried it before . even if the product ha very poor value , the customer never know about it before using it . so , the people who make the advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are . third , customer easily lose their sight about judging the advertisement . while they are watching the advertisement , they easily lose their mind which they already know about the fake of the advertisement . because of this reason , the worker who work for the advertisement company are trying to make the product seem much better that they really are . for these reason ; people want to be a cool person , people do not know the product 's value , and people can easily lose their sight about the capacity to judge the advertisement , we should think about the advertisement . people should aware to watching the advertisement and think again about the product that the people are willing to buy .
