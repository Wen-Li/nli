i do not agree to the mentioned statement in whole that young people nowadays do not spend enough time to help in their community . i have made different experience . on the one hand there are these young people who do not spent a lot of time or no time in a community at all . these people are self-centred about theirselfes and their life because they have everything they need by now and are happy with that . a lot of them do not want to join or help in community because they think it is too much work and they like spending their free time on other thing . a negative thing is that the most of them do not know that helping in a community is not just work but also fun because they never experienced it or heard it diffenrent from others . but on the other hand there are those young people who are helping in community and also join them . these people like to be in contact to member of their community and like to work together and make experience together aswell a having fun and a good time together . there are various opportunity in a community where you can help at if it is in church or in school or in vacation trip and many other opportunity . these youngster like to spend their time , also their free time , with a lot of people that have the same interest . they want to improve thing or make thing like church to other people more interesting . in my opinion there are about the same number of people that are helping in a community and not . i have this opinion because i know a lot of people who are active in a community but also know a few that are not even member in a community . in my mind it also depends on the size of the city . in smaller city young people are probably more interested in community than in bigger city .
