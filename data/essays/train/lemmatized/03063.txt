`` it is better to be specialized in one specific subject , than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . '' today , the society is made in such a way that it focus on `` equality '' amongst all . this fact is supported and shown in many part of the society such a school and sport team . a school is a place where student are enabled to gain knowledge on whatever subject needed to live in a society . the problem seen in many school is that often school requires every student to know the same subject and doe not allow them to specialize in whatever they want to study . that is , most of the school see value in building broad , various knowledge of many academic subject rather than to specialize in one . yes , it is a fact that maybe broad knowledge about various subject would help student learn to live smarter in the society , but it also ha a great chance of ruining student ' specific ability or potential that they originally have . everyone is different in their own way , and more importantly , they are good in their own way . that is , there is not much of a need to know various-but-broad subject , for they will be provided with shallow knowledge only . instead , student shold decide to go to whatever field they want to go , and specialize from there . learning tiny bit of everything would only kill uniqueness and produce sameness among the student . the example and problem of having everyone with the same skill level is shown by japanese national soccer team . traditionally , japanese coach consist on having his team player have the same exact ability in every field ; running speed , shooting sense , passing , stamen , etc . the problem with this is that even though the team might not have to worry about anyone lacking specific ability , it will suffer from not having anyone really good at anything . in soccer there are offensive , middle , and defensive player . but what if everyone had the same exact style of playing ? what good there is to have a goalie who can run a fast a the offensive player ? that is , not just that game will be boring due to the way they play , but they will be unsuccessful a well because they lack player with specialized skill . strikers score goal because they are skilled in that field , and goalie save shot because that is what they are good at . therefore , not just soccer player , but student should also learn to be unique and specialize in one field where they can shine . in conclusion , it is better to be specialized in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge on many academic subject . this opinion wa supported by typical school and japanese national soccer team example . to summer up , be unique and specialize in your own field !
