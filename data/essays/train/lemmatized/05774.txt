different people have various opinion about education problem . studying fact ha it advantage for student . for example , student can study a lot of thing within short time . studying formula is the best example . if we study how to soluve problem by certain formula , we could utlize many problem especially math . however , i strongly agree with the statement . there are more advantage to study concept for student . the best example , which illustrate my point of view is studying science . when i wa a child , my parent encouraged me to have curriousities . they made me to think why the rainbow is coorful and why shape of the moon is different , and so on . then i tried to figure out the sturucture and element of them by myself . sometimes i went to library to research and asked professonal people . from this process , i trained an ability of how to soluve problem . this is really important studying for childlen . in spite of this , if student just study fact , they regard the fact without doubtful . as many student study only fact , the new idea and concept will not be produced . even new technology will not progress at all . and when student encounter problem without ability of how to soluve the problem , they can not do anything . the my primary consideration with respect to education is studying thinking process and concept are more inportant than learning fact .
