man 's pursuit of technology ha brought him in today 's world where everything designed and made by him give an affirmation to the dream he had sought for , the dream to live happily and comfortably . in the light of that dream , and various cogent reason , i disapprove of the statement mentioned in the topic . we are certainly going to have more car in use in twenty year from now , a we have now . the question put up in the topic may be valid on two count . firstly , becasue of the depletion of oil in earth 's reserve , fuel 's shortage could be a driving force of reduction in number of car . secondly , the alarming rate at which the pollution is increasing may amount to a strict ban on the car that emit harmful gas . but both these reason fail to ass the parameter completely they seek to build their case on . the argument against these point is alternative . neo-malthusian economist beleived that increased use of natural resource will tend to increase their cost with time . however , the famous simon-elrich wager in 1980 toppled that theory . while elrich said that price of five natural resource ( which they selected ) is bound to decrease in ten year , simon placed a bet that it would reduce . the price actually suffered a decline ! the simple reason is alternative . as society 's need grow and resource fall short , various alternative come up and keep the momentum alive . in the similar vein , we can expect the car running on alternative fuel rather than petroleum . billions of dollar , today , are spent on research on alternative source of energy . we even have countless city where use of cng ( compressed natural gas ) ha replaced petrol a the fuel . the advancement in technology are sure to pave way for the solar car in future . all this will experience a rise in the number of car . the same alternative fuel act a harmless substance to the atmpsphere , and amount to a reduction in the pollution . it is imperative to mention here , that apportioned study of the air sample ha suggested that most of the city , the air pollution is caused more by the factory than by automobile . with the kyoto protocol in place , the country have now decided and taken firm step to curb pollution , not necessarily by removing vehicle plying on the road , but by ensuring that they conform to the euro iii , euro iv standard , and also checking the constituent of exhaust from factory . with possibility of more ore country joining the protocol , car remain invulnerable . the past also corroborates the fact that car will increase . the question of reduction in their number is not new , and even earlier , skeptic shared this viewpoint . but data suggests that country , especially after the globalisation and liberalisation , have suffered a dramatic rise in the number of car in past few year , and researcher have predicted that because the purchasing power ability of people in most country is steadily increasing , production of car is not going to cease . the space is also not a problem . with the advent of newer mechanism of building high rise building with parking at the basement and also the construction of various flyover on top of the other , assures that man is ever thinking and persevering individual , who work hard and keep his invention alive . the rise in the love for automobile , whether in the form of formula 1 racing or automobile engineering , constantly over the year , is going to ensure that new car with newer design and comfort level continue plying in the street . when we live in the information superhighway , transportation remains crucial point of improvisation . in this view , if we need to pace ourselves with the fast moving world , we need to save time and act modern . giving argument against the technological development that eare impending is belittling our own self . we must look at the bright side of the picture . the car today , have impregnated into the very social fabric of people , and it ha become inalienable part of their life . separation of car from humanity is very difficult , given the fact that it ha become a necessity rather than just an accessory . coming time will witness a surge in the number of car , whose concept , design and power will outweigh the one that we have today .
