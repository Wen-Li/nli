there are some step for selling a product . the frist step is to produce and in tha last decedes this is the esieast step . the second step is the advertise and delivery of the product . advertisement i very important . doing something without advetisement is a like a blinking ti girl in the dark . only you can see what you do . but at this point the amount of the advertisement is important also . there must be a limit for these . because more advertisement mean more money and more market to delver the product . the other reason is if you make more advetisement you must deal with much more people . firstly , the reason about money . advertisement is a money = needed process . for instance , tv show advertisement is very effective but money for these is too big . newspaper banner , web page link , radio talk are the same of course . all these need money . because of these when you think about more advertiesement you must concider about your budget . secondly the more advertisement you make , the more people you deal with . dealing with more people mean that you need mere customer relation and more thought to support customer demand . for example , colaturka , a new turkish cola brand , made lot of advertisement via all the medium channel , newspaper etc . but whne the advertisement died down the custumors want to buy this brand . but colaturka could n't reserve the demand so the firm loose money . we can understand from this instance , we must get prepared before making advertisement of a product . consequently , advertiment is expensive and risky process . so when we think about making advertisement , we must think about our budget , the field of our product and our source for reserving customer demand .
