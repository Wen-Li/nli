it ha been rightly said , `` little knowledge is a dangerous thing , drink deep or taste not the pierian spring , there small draught intoxicate the brain , while drinking largely sobers u again ! '' indeed , i believe that instead of limiting kowledge to small draught of one subject , it is much more beneficial to have broad knowledge of many academic subject just like drinking largely from the pierian spring . if we specialize in one subject , our knowledge is contained only within the narrow boundary of that subject while the vast ocean of truth lie undiscovered before u . we become ignorant about other impotant thing that we need to know in order to attain a high level of intelligence and understanding . by specializing in one subject , we tend to forget that there are million of other possibility in store for u , that there is so much knowlege to gain in this world and so little time . with a broad knowledge or several thing , we widen our vision and expand our horizon . we realize that we have mile to go before we sleep . broad knowlege enlightens u about the vastness of this universe and make u aware that even if we spend out entire lifetime gaining knowledge , there will still be thousand of thing that we are ignorant about . another important fact is that various aspect of knowledge are related to one another . without being aware of other subject , knowledge of our own subject becomes constricted and we tend to have a narrow minded approach towards thing . moreover , if fact are brick , accumulation of fact is a much knowledge a a pile of brick is a house . we need to know what is going on around u to put our knowledge to good use . also , practically speaking , what use is speacialization in one subject in our daily life ? is a ph . d in microbiology going to help u cope with the obstacle of everyday life ? only awareness of every branch of academic can enable u to practically gain benefit . so , it is my firm opinion that one should try to learn a much a possible in this short life given to u . i , personally , would prefer to be a jack of all trade rather than a master of just one .
