there is many kind of people in this world . also there is a lot of people who had successful with something . some people believe that they good at and always . try to do something that they already know very well . i believe that the people who succeed in the society must be willng to try something new and take risk rather than only doing what they knoe well . but , in my opinion , successful people should do only that thing they already know how to do . beacuse if you try to do something new thing you may will have hard time to come back to that thing you could do it beafore . for example , let 's say your jop is a `` successful dentist '' . but , one day you learned how to play golf . since than you got too much in to the playing golf and you deside to be pro-golfer . may be you will be amazing pro golfer . but there only little chance to be like that i think . beacuse you spend allmost every time to be a dentist in your lifetime . at
