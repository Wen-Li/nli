my personal experience lead me to state that knowing the fact is more important than understanding idea and concept , mainly because i think one should try to be a indepenent a possible in life , this including the way one 's own idea are formed after being explained from a third party in order to be understood . i think what i am looking for is probably an impossible concept : objective information , or any fact one would like to make research on that are not pre-processed or in any way filtered . facts , although affacted by who they are represented and reported by , are far more objective than idea and concept that may be communicated by other people , simply because if one is given the idea or concept already , he or she will not be given the right to a more personal judgment . i think this topic particularly affect me , since i have progressively become aware of how much more knowledge of fact i need in order to understand the present matter of the society i live in . this includes the understanding of politics in my country in the first place and internationally in the second place , obviously followed by history . recently i finally manged to find some time out of my schedule for reading more about the histoy of the last century in italy , while the next step will be the people 's history , a book on the american history , probably followed by some reasearch on another main topic of our recent time : war on terror and their political a well a historical background . i am convinced that only fact can make me have the whole picture and that only a vast eagle view on them , a a multiple-sourced investigation can offer , will eventually lead closer to a better , more solid objective idea , concept or belief to stick with when choosing in life .
