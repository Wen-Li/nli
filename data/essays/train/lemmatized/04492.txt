i do not agree that in twenty year there will be be fewer car in use than there are today . we could n't stop to use car that give freedom in our life . even they have polluted the enviroment since first gas engine built , it can be fixed by new generation powertrain component . for instance , emmision group have set up regulation for the ciritcal value of exhauts gas and substance . in fact , human population increase rapidly than we hope and all people need vehicle such a car to use efficiently their time . car help u to go whatever we want without awating anything . it is also critical that you can safe anybody'life with car . cars are our hand and improve our social acivity . you can get your firends or family even they are far away from your home . you may use your phone to reach them but your sound is not enough sometimes . if you want to see anybody or being anywhere with your own decision than you need car to do all . in the mean time , shape of the car and engine trend will be different from nowadays that all useful item in term of humanity could be added on it . but all of them wo n't decrease the usage of car . new trend allow the people get car more cheaper and use alernative energy source to prevent giving any damage the habitat . moreover people feel more freedom to do what they want . . everbody try to get more than one car for their parent and boy so that they can dirve their way . all in all , car production will be increased annualy and help people any point of their life . it is neccesary that govermant should give some financial advantage to company produced car . it help people dream become real so that they will be happy .
