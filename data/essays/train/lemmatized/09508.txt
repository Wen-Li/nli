an advertisement is a publicity for an object , a restaurant or food . the company that make it want the people who watch the advertisement to go to that specific restaurant or buy that particular object . we will first discus the principle of advertising and then we will explain our specific opinion about the statement . to begin with , an advertisement is made so that the company that offer the service or the good can sell more of it . therefore , the general idea is to make , for example , the object seem necessary at home , the office or even in the car . to make it so attractive the producer need to put forward it best quality which will revolutionise your day to day lifestyle . for example , we can put ourselves in the situation where we need to advertise car perfume . we will , in a first part , demonstrate that most car have very bad smell and , then , that once the buyer purchased the car perfume these smell disappeared . the producer will try to limit the fact it might take some time for the perfume to act . but are these principle there to make product seem much better ? in my opinion , i truly believe that `` advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' taking our last example , the fact that the producer limit , in the advertisement , the perfume 's action time is false information . the advertisement will necessarily show that the smell disappeared immediately after the man entered the car with the perfume . of course , there are many example of this . at mcdonald 's , the big macs are nowhere near a perfect a in their commercial . in a general way , most people know that every object will not be exactly like in the commercial . the general population can make the difference between the ad and what the object will be like . eventhough , they do make product seem better than they really are , the only thing that count is that the difference between reality and the commercial is not extremely large . to conclude , our and our parent ' generation have been brought up with advertisement and with the company ' will to lure more customer . therefore , i believe that if some company `` stretch '' the truth about their product , a long a it is not in the extreme , then their advertisement are still ethically correct .
