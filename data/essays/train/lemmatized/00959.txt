first of all , i do not disagree with the statement of young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , and secondly , i think this statement is merely based on the stereotype which the adult project on adolescent . nowadays , young people are acting more independent than their senior . they know more of what they want , why they want it and how they going to get it . however , this change doe not please most of the adult who still believe in the social hierarchy of age which is keeping junior under control . this is the crux of the problem , and in this case , the two paries see the title and definition of `` helping thier community '' differently . in my neighborhood , there is a brilliant young girl who ha saved many child from domestic abuse . whenever sara hears parent beating their kid in a much too violent way , she is brave enough to report to the authority concerned about each severe case in the community . nevertheless , most of the adult complaint about her behavior to her parent , and sara get grounded several time for rescueing bleeding child and even bruised infant . moreover , in my colleage year , i have seen student organizing club which aim at supervising the school 's recycling operaiont or urging more tree planting on campus . most of their scheme , even in their most well-designed and pratical form , are rejected . the school 's reluctance to participate in such community reform activity show a rather great contrast to the student ' effort and desire of changing the world into a paradise . as far a i know , only young people of sara 's age admire her devotion to the neighborhood , and the adult simply see her a a trouble . also , the club member in my college never give up any chance to come to the community 's aid despite the negativeness of the school . these situation teach me a lesson about how aduts or the whole society will not always be right . young people from around the world all posse great passion in helping their community to become a better place to live , and sometimes , they are even more enthusiastic than the grown-ups surrounding them .
