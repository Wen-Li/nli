a growing number of people believe that specializing in one specific subject is more beneficial for student than having broad knowledge of many academic subject . however , contrary to the popluare trend , i strongly believe that broad knowledge is better for student . the rationale behind this is that it help student to be well-arouned people . in addition , student can work better after hiring in company . first of all , broad understanding of various academic subject play a pivotal role in rasing student well-rounded people . it is largely because , if people learn only one speific subject , the life would be boring and they can not understand other aspect of life . learning other subject can broaden their horizen . for example , my major wa chemistry in university . however , i attend other class like art , writing . therefore , i can write better and understand other people well . it made my life more affluent . secondly , broad understanding of diverse subject contributes to working better in company . it is largely because , when student learn various kind of subject they not only understand their part of the work but also they can grasp the other role 's of other people 's work . therefore , they can work more effectively . to be specific , my friend , jihuen wa hired by hyundai , which build the apartment . even though her major wa architect she had to attend the art class and when she work at the company she could do well , because she could design better . in conclusion , having broad knowledge is more helpful for studnets . it is because student can be more well-rounded and work better when they hired .
