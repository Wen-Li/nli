first of all i would like to define what a car might be in 20 year . for me it is possible that car can fly in twenty year . thus , the traffic will extend from the ground into the air . the world 's population is increasing every year , which mean that there will be more customer , who will need a car . china , for example , is becoming economicly more and more successfull . there will be an increase in the employment rate , which lead to a higher qualified personal and an increase in the individual income . basicly , people can afford more , and one of the first thing someone buy when he can afford it , is a car . at hte same time more poeple mean more logistics to sustain the basic necissities of life . there will be an increse in public transportation a well . if there will be rescrictions on the total number of vehicle on the planet because of pollution , i simply say that fossil resource will be exhausted in twenty year , anyway , and that engine will run on electricity from sunlight or other clean energy source . cars are the cheapest choice for transporting , next to train of course , but they are much more mobile than train and therefore more frequently used to transport good . i guess that the car producing industry will although have a word in that matter , because it is an ever newe inventative section of industry , which provides may working place all over the planet . the car industry can count on governmental aid should it ever come to a point when no more car are neede , which will never . ever ! therefore i totally diagree with the statement , that there will be le car on the road than there are today . human society and the world wide trade would crush down without a agil and cheap transportation systam a car .
