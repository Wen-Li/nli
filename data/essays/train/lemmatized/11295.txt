in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today and i am strongly agreeing on that statement . currently the world is changing in extremly fast speed than what we expect . especially technology is the part where human are really concentrating on and that will bring lot of influence to the future car . also environmental problem will give influence to stop making car . according to the news article , the world gasoline will run out in next 10 year . if there are n't any gasoline left in the world then the car wo n't move . currently most of the car are moving with gasoline and it is in serious problem . lot of car company are feeling this is serious problem , and they decided to make hybrid car . instead of making new designed-car they thought making hybrid car will be more efficient car in the future . instead of gasoline , they will use alternative energy such a crude palm oil or the sunlight . next twenty year will come really fast and probably they ca n't produce lot of hybrid car so number of car in next twenty year will be fewer than now . second lot of environmental issue had been brought by car and that will reduce the number of car in the future . at present , due to air pollution , the global warming is happening . the ozone layer ha the huge hole due to air pollution . the main reason can be co2 which is coming out from the car . to save the world , lot of country will reduce the number of car to stop global warming . anyway a i mentioned in above information , the car wo n't go because there wo n't be any gasoline left so car which is running with gas will goto junk yard or developed into other tool machine . with two above evidence , in next twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . due to car which are running with gasoline are causing lot of problem to the world and that will reduce the number of car in the future .
