i do n't agree with this statement for different aspect . first of all , the school offered me the possibility to know a lot of information about all theme and it offered me the possibility to tell my opinion about different argument . all these thing are very interesting and important but i often see that what we learn in abstract it often it doesn ' respect reality . the most interesting example that i can do to explain this point is the university . i 'm a student of the last year in management engeenering and in all these year i 've studied a lot of mathematical model and way that explain how it 's possible to manage a company . in these last month i went to interview different company for my final project about performance management . in these interview i realized that their way to work is very different from the model that teacher explained to me in the different course that i followed to the university . surely the basic information are the same , but the real work is very different to the concept and idea that i studied . for this motive i believe that idea and concept are very important to a student to learn and to undestand but all this is only the underground know-how that everyone must have . that it is very important and to try to apply what we know to the reality and to try to larn especially from what happens everyday .
