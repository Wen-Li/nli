all the people have a different opinion about this statement and many time in my life i just had spoken about this with my friend or my parent . the conclusion i can find is that young people not enjoy life more thar older people . i say this because i think that in the course of the life every man change his opinion about enjoy the life . so in the young age the idea about enjoy life is based only in to have a good time , to enjoy with his friend and to have always more free time . when we grow this kind of view change for many people and if change the kind of view the behavior change too . this new mentality of the older people is the reason of the change of `` enjoy life '' . in fact if when we are young the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the life ( in his classical interpretation ) , but when we are older we prefer to enjoy the life in different way . the older people in fact prefer to enjoy their family , their wife , their child and for this reason probably they spent different their money . i think this because now i am 24 year old and just i saw this change in my mentality . when i wa a young student i liked always to have fun and to enjoy , and i spent all my money for this , but now i have finished the university and my kind of thinking about enjoy life is changed . now i thinking more to find a good job and to buy my house . but i enjoy life too , only i do this in a different way now . it 's sure that when i grow more and i will more older i will change this way to enjoy life , but it 's normal , i think this appen on all the people .
