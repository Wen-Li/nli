i agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' because youngster nowadays are being a lot of career conscious . they want to make a respectable position for themselves in the society and inorder to achieve this they are bending their back by working hard towards acheiving their goal . this type of thinking by the youngster is good only upto a certain extent that is upto earning a respectable position in the society , but you have to return something to the the society from which you have taken something and that is your service to the society . in this age of globalisation , getting a job is very easy if you have the qualification for it . most of the working youngster want to earn more and and enjoy their free time . they do not care what is happening in their own community , what are the problem and how to resolve these problem all they want to do is to enjoy they do not realise that there is a problem until they face one themselves . none of the youngster are willing to do social service and most of them are becoming selfish and they are thinking about themselves . even the society doe play a part in not teaching youngster about social value and ethic . young people should be taught to help their community atleast on their holiday with one thing or the other form their childhood . it should be made a a classroom work to help the community for atleast some hour a week . for example student can be taught to help elder people in old age home a it will give happiness to them or other wise help the public park maintain cleanliness with a special cleaning drive involving all the school in that locality . it should also be kept in mind that illiterate child be taught education through educated youngster in a public hall or arena to reduce illiterate a every educated person can teach others what he ha learnt .
