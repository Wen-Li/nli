planning to see fewer car in use in twenty year is a good perspective but i can hardly imagine it . i can only consider it a an illusion . basically , people enjoy driving to go working , shopping or to the beach . if you live in a city , i would encourage you to observe and count a many car a possible for one minute . i guess you would be surprised . it appears to be quite clear that some people really need a car . first , a car , it is useful . it is useful by the fact that you can get anywhere , at any time , the way you want . the only thing that may slow you down is traffic jam . and when you live far from any city , any shop , any bus stop , a car is very useful . then , a car , it can reveal something else . this is part of the thing you can also notice ( when you are observing on the pavement ) , it is the number of people in the car . you can hardly see more than two ( except when it is a family and when they are two child at the back ! ) . yes , because owning a car ha always been a sign of power . we live in a society where people feel like buying and owning new and often expensive thnigs in oder to be proud of them and expose them . people who make advertisement know that and have used this idea so many time . and especially the cliche about middle-age men driving a fast and powerful car . it is said that you could describe people according to the car they 've got and vice-versa . i guess in our current society , it is a sign of power , of prosperity and modernity . and this is not going to change . .. and the last but not least important fact it the evolution , over the last year , of the mean of transport in any city all over the world . bangkok is a good example . the skytrain a well a the undergroung are sometimes crowded but not so much . there are seat available quite often . the only thing you can notice and you have probably been noticing it for a long time now is that the road keep being flooded by car ! it may be better and le than before but before seeing fewer car in use , we will probably have to wait more than twenty year .
