in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i do n't agree with this statement because everyone want to have a car . in this essay i will give some reason why i have this opinion . first of all and that 's in my opinion the main reason why i think that in twenty year there will be more car than there are today , is that most of the people get richer , so they earn more money and they want to have a good reputation and to look great , that 's why most rich people want to have the newest and best looking car at the moment . in addition to that the car are getting cheaper with the time because the automobile industry produce more car . another reason is that the youth want to have car earlier so they get car often a a present . today the people do n't really want to live anymore in the city , so they move to the suburb and sometimes it is n't possible to reach other place without problem , then it is more practical to have very early a car to be more independent . in my opinion in few year the car will have such a high technical standard which is better for the environment than today and this will be another important reason why there will be more car in the future than now . in conclusion i disagree with the statement and with the reason i have listed above i support my opinion . people will earn more money not to have only one car , but two or three . then a new technology will appear in a few year , and will be a second reason why car driving wo n't be worse for the environment anymore . the last reason will be that people will move from the city to the suburb .
