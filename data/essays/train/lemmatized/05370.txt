i agree with it . nowadays young people are changing . they just think about them self . internet and mining are changing so made them to think about them self . why i said internet make u change is , in internet we are allowed to do everything and have own world . we have own hompies blog so we can get happiness from decorating thosese , and watching what they made . in internet nobody care , no one know who i am , so we can do whatever we want . consequently we ca n't think about others , because we have many thing to do for them self . so we dont give time time to helping their community . but i thing helping their community are more vaulable then decorating , or having fun in unreal world . i think we should get more interst in communicates .
