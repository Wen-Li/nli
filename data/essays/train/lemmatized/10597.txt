i agree with the statement . i have two reason . one reason is young people is always energetic and have excited thought of what they do and what they want to do in the future . young people have a lot of thing that they have not done yet . so they dream about the future evry day . i dream about what i want to do in the future all the time . i w and the other reason is that they have a lot of thing that they should do in their youth . for example , study . young peaple can lean fast than old people . my parent and teacher always say `` study hard when you are still young ! '' i think if we leaned a lot of thing in youth , we can live much better life in the future physical and mental . i like to learn new thing . when i learn something new , i feel like i am getting smart and getting close to adult . i think old people enjoy life too , but i think old people did most exciting thing when they were young . so they are now relaxing and having slow time with the partner watching the grand child growing and enjoying life .
