i do agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . the first reason is because you could know exactly what is your schedule about time and place . it is important because i could obtain , before the trip , some information which will help me during my tour . for example , if a tour go through a few museum , i could have information related to artist , painting and sculpture . it will help me to understand in a better way what thing i am discovering and looking at . furthermore i will have a foundation to ask some question for achieving a deep comprehension . another reason to take a tour is i could take advantage of the trip moment by moment . it permit me to know more new thing and city into a short period of time . therefore i will not miss any detail of a tour . besides to travel into a group led by a tour is more confortable because i will not be worried of certain fact , a for example : booking hotel , arranging travel ticket , looking for the best transportation way , contract , among others . the last reason , and maybe the most important for me , is that this kind of trip allows me to meet other people with the same interest such a to discover new culture , to admire beautiful city and country , and to increase our general knowledge about the world . furthermore i cou a tour guide ha a special preparation of several subject and if we have a question , we will have always his support during the trip . these are important reason to support why i do not like travel by myself and how much i could enjoy a trip by sharing my time with other people without to be stressed by certain thing which could be in the proffesional people 's hand .
