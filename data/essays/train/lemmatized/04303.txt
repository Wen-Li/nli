what successful people ha in common ? how do they reach this success ? it is probably a more complex question that it seems . some people are sure to meet their goal and to be successfull by taking risk and attempting new thing . yet others are just trying to become the best in one well-known field and do not dare to go through new experience . at issue is how to meet your assignment and reach success . to the most daring people , every experience is good to try . that is true that an attempt doe not do any harm . and even if your experience doe not appear a good a you expected , you still learn a lot . most experience doe worth a try . for instance , if you want to become a good cooker , you should try new receipes . to learn how to cook , you need to invent new receipes and not only to follow others advice . however , some people prefer to adopt a le risky behaviour . they are going to reach their goal by following , pace by pace , others advice . some artisan seem to match this description . they want a comprehensive view of their own field and they are going to explore what doe already exist . it is a different approach but they are likely to reach success . their knowledge need patience and long lasting research . for instance , in order to know how to work wood m , you could explore different civilisation and culture . you will certainly discover a great amount of interesting detail which are going to be a great help in your next work . i found that i ca n't align myself on either behaviour . most of the time , i adopt both attitude to meet my assignment . in order to be successfull , both taking risk and following the well-known path is usefull and effective .
