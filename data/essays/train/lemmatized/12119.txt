today , we tend to prefer changing lifestyle , trying new thing and taking risk rather than holding on to what we have and what we already know . but thinking about it , i believe that it is sometimes worth the pain to stay with what what we already know . taking risk can indeed be seen a the better way to live one 's life strongly . it is the best way to avoid a borring life , for example waking up every morning , fourty yers along , to go to the same place , work with the same poeple . it is clearly more appealing to decide one day to become a teacher , because you already know everything beeing a doctor could bring to your life . this viewpoint allows you to feel adventurous and to have , maybe , several life in one life . however , i would like to defend my point thet sometimes holding to what we already have is more responsible , more interesting , and can lead you to a happier life . it appears to me that it is better to deepen one 's knowledge in a particular field than to try to know everything . for instance , one should rather concentrate on a specific field of study than trying to tempt everything because he want to try new thing . it is better , then , to try to make the thing we already have work well than to escape each time we feel ennoyed . i believe that this is a value people are tending to loose today in our society , and this may be an explaination for the spectacular increase of divorce . to conclude , i think that we are too often tempted to escape from what we have , while we should rather hold on and try our best to make the thing we already have work .
