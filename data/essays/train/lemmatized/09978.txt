as far a i am concerned from my own life ; young people really enjoy life more than elderly people . having fun from life is a wide range area for debating . however ; fun is a fun ! needless to say young people do it in a more efficient way in their whole life . we can see it from many example from thir life style . firstly ; there is an energy inside young people for doing many activity . they really want to learn life by trying different and excited activity . most of them are enjoyable one which show differentiation in different people . by way of illustration ; driving faslty is an exciting hobby for young people . however it is too hazardeous . therefore old people do not want to this a a hobby for living more ! eventually they know the risk of it 's result . anyway it is an enjoyable activity in closed area . is n't it ? secondly ; young people are rather interested in technology instead of using the ancient model of technology . it ha many enjoyable product like play station ; computer game ; cell phone . .. etc . young people would like to buy new product ; whereas the elderly people could not get accustom to the new technology . thus : they use the old model until they broke . playing a play station game ha been my best hobby since my child time . you really become more relax than anytime in your life . because it game include interesting character and also place which you have never seen before . however ; according to elderly people it is a waste of time . isn ` t it a boring thought ? to conclude ; the life is too short ; then why we do n't enjoy for feeling more happy and relax ? i think older people could not think the importance of enjoy . they may be do some enjoyable event but presumably it is not enjoyable for younger people . it is high time that they should enjoy life !
