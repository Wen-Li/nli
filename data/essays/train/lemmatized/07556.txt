in my point of view , old peolpe are more happy of there life than young people . there are three reason to this opinion . first , young people have a lot of problem . then you study you have all the stress of the examination . furthermore , it 's in this perdiod of life that you have to decidate of your future and you know it . you are conscient that all your decision will have a very big effect on your avenir . second , older person are more able to appreciate than the young generation . the oldest genaration have experience so they are more able to take in account what happen . they already achive something in there life so this people are more confidente . for exemple , when a 18 year old man felt in love we certanly not realise the chance that he have . on the over hand a 45 year old man realise exactly the chance that he have when he is in love . finaly , although some people think that because student make more party they enjoy more there time . it 's well know that alcool , who is to much drunk at this party , covert only the problem of this person . in conclusion , i will said that because of the too stressful situation that is accepted with alcool and the security and experience of old generation ; young people do n't enjoy life more than the older people do .
