in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . when were car invinted ? how many car were produced since that date ? what 's the annual growth of car ' production ? this wa all i needed to think about to decide if i agree or disagree with the provided statement . i of course disagree with the statement . why do i disagree with the statement ? it 's because of my question that i asked myself earlier when trying to decide if i agree with the statement or not . not only because of these question that i disagree with the statement . let 's just take a look at the vehicle industry , how many manufactoring company were in the market just 50 year ago in comparison to the number of company these day ? i used to be able to know what wa the brand of a car by just looking at the design , and they were n't that many . now each company ha more than 10 model of car and i 'll not claim that i know all brand out there but here while i 'm writing this essay i can remember 37 brand . this would n't be the case if number of car are expected to drop any time soon , except maybe if we invinted flying car . even if i do n't bring up statistic and work with only perception ; i 've been driving for over 7 year now and i can honestly say that each year it get worst . traffic is becoming a nightmare , number of bridge and underground station are trippling each year not even doubling . i live in cairo , and i believe there will come a time when we will not find a place on ground to have another underground station and i ca n't even imagine where are they going to find space to build more bridge . maybe if public transportation were more organized , or if we increase the age group that can be permitted to drive ; say 21 year of age . i do n't realy know what can be done to decrease the invasion of car . what i do know is that car usage is increasing and it 's not decreasing anytime soon .
