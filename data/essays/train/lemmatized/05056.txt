i really agree with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . traveling along while plnning it by oneslef look fun . however , we may disadvantage about economical , safe , and psychological point . traveling not by a group tour may challengable because we have to decide everything by ourselves . planning a travl will be fun and we will have a different taste from the group travel for their own design . however , it can be kind of waste of time and money . usually , the group tour by a tour guide is cheaper for the larege number of a group and the guider will have enough of information around the area . it is out of question that the company of guiding a tour ha a good capacity of information . another issue can be safty . going new place for a tour can carry along crime . one guy who travel to spain , for an example , wa stolen a camera in a train . he realized that it happens so often in this area for the foreign tourist later . if he travel in a group , such a bad luck will happen rarely . the most valuable thing of tour is giving a good relief to people . they can forget their normal life and relieve their mental stress while in tour . if they plan for their town tour , it will be stressful . i heard that a couple who go for a tour had a big trouble between them because they found some difficult issue in travel and got stress . as i mention above , planing for a tour by oursleve look wonderful . but , we will spend more money , time and in dangerous with lack of information . moreover , we will still in a stress while in a tour for the relife of mental .
