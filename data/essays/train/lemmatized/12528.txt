the problem to discus in this essay is if in the next future the number of car will raise or not . i think it will be . to explain my opinion about this argoument i will consider two fact . first the number of car , all others equal , is related to the growth of world population . while population is raising in the majority of the country it 's very probable that the supply of car will increase . it 's also important to consider the fact that many country are leaving their status of poorty . well this can lead to a better situation for all people who first lived with only elementary good . this mean a high probability of raising the number of car sold . a second reason . that at a first view can fight the idea of an increase in the number of car in the future , is the negative trend in the production of oil . it 's well known that in the next decade the oil will finish but there is a real possibility that through hydrogen we will continue to drive our car !! let 's view at the problem that the car 's industry will look at . at sure there is an increasing trend of governaments of many country to support the use of public transport and to fight the use of car . otherway i think this is a very slow process tha will give good result in more than twenty or thirty year . a second problem is the fight supported by world organization like onu or greenpeace . it 's important to point to the different problem these organization have to face , like obstacle introduced by the most advanced country who support industrialization . at the end i think the problem that the car industry will fight are very weak so the number of car will rise in the future .
