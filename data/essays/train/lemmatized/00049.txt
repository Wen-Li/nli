it is a controversal problem about whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subject or not . differnet people may make different disscions acroding to their backgroud . some friend of mine think that it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject such a math or music . but acroding to my own personality and backgroud , i can not agree with them . i think man should have broad knowledge of many academic subject . reasons and evidence are listed a following . the world now , unlike 100 year before , need man who only know one subject . it need people can have a broad knowledge . for example , the engineer now ont only need to know about engineering , but also need to have the ablity to use computer . because most of their work are completed on the computer . so if he is only a specialist about engineering , he will not finish his work prefectly . forthemore , having broad knowledge of many academic subject is to make the student get used to the world now a well a to let them have a wide choose for the future . it is hard to say that a student major engineering will become an engineer after his graduation . it is common to see student in college change their major . but a man only good at one subjuect will not have the free to do so . as the most morden building are the mixture of music and painting . a specialist is the man who soecializes in more than one subject . the famous english detecter in the noverl are good at detective and music . such example can be seen during every day life . a man should have a wide knowledge of many subject because the world need him to do so . though some people may think that too much interest will make the man good at nothing . but i think a capable man can benifit from his wide interest , for his interest will finally help his to do achieve in his major
