students often have to learn a lot of thing in their study . the basis for them is to learn the fact and then to understand idea and concept behind these idea . so it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because it is impossible for student to keep all fact in mind , because they would not be able to connect the fact they have learned in one subject with the fact of another subject and because they would not be able to interpret all the fact ' consequence . of course it depends on a student 's course how many fact he or she ha to learn but in 4 year of study , there are a lot of fact which are impossible to keep them all in mind . i study history and i am now in the 6th semester . each day we learn a lot of fact and date . i , personally , know only about a 10th of all fact and date i have heard during my study . and these 10 % are already a lot . moreover a student would not be able to connect the fact he or she ha learned in one subject with the fact he or she ha learned in another subject . the student would not see a dependency or other relation between two fact . a friend of mine e.g. study economy . there he ha to learn fact in finance and fact in marketing . one might think that these two subject have nothing in common but it might happen that something ha to be calculated in marketing in the same way it ha to be done in finance . here would be a relation which a student who only learns fact , would not see . then the interpretation of the fact ' consequence is important . the student have to know how some e.g. key number are created . it might happen that they are not true . all in all it is to say that the basis of studying are the fact . without these fact it would be impossible to come to new idea and concept . but more important are idea and concept to see behind the fact and to discus them . only by learning fact this would be impossible . the student would not be able to connect fact of several subject and he would not be able to see the fact ' consequence .
