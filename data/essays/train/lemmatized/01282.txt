we only live once , and for a quite short period of time . it is possible to divide life into two half . the first half is from the birth to the age of fourty , and i am sure you will guess the second one . the descending time follows the ascending time . but is reality so binary ? a proof that young people enjoy life more than older people is that child always laugh . but why are they so happy ? certainly because everything is still possible for them . they are able to run and play football while elder sit in their wheel chair . they learn and improve their skill every single day while it is exactly the opposite for older people . young people are able to love and do not feel concerned by the problem the world face : they do not even know what tomorrow will be made of ! hopefully , older people have other source of pleasure . above all they have a lot of free time which they can use to do everything they want . they have no reason to doubt about their future , because it is behind them . everything is possible at any age and everyone can be the most important to enjoy life is to keep young in his head . age doe not matter , only what we do with our time down here matter .
