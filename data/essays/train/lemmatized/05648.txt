cars are somethings which were earlier considered a an luxious mode of transport . but now a day they more convienient and necessary mode . as time is changing may be the automobile company would have would have new option for the buyer . i partially agree with the statment that in twenty year there would be fewer car in use than there are today . because india is still a developing country . those who have develped successfully might have option . india ha to raise it economy . there are people still staying at foot path . according me yes may be we wont be able to see small car like santro , zen etc during that time definately indian economy would have raised n people instead of using small car would prefer to use big car like benz or posh . nowa day we r seeing increasing rate of petrol and disel . people find it dificult to tarvel by autorishaws and cab mainly because of heavy traffic and mort important thing the attitude of the driver they easily have the habit to say no . but if one ha it own conveince he/she may travel easily . but yes a i said earlier that india will be developed in the near future . where ther r possibilties of having one om chatered plane or other facility . now a day price fare for the airline ticket too have gone down . it become cheaper and now a day ther are many flight going daily internationly a well a domestic . like recently i visted madras my family prefered going by plane because it save time and ther wa hardly differance in the cost . now a day only peole are not having time for their personal comitments and that men are replaced by machinery . may be twenty year down the line robberts and other machinery would replace man . according to me there would be difinately a change in the society le trafic more development on different mode of tranport . which would be easily accessable .
