i disagree with this statement . i strongly believe that in 20 year there will be more car in use . first . why do people buy car ? because they want to get an easy access to everywhere . they can go to wherever they want . though the mordern transportation ha provided a fairly convenient way for people to travel le time . can a plain directly take you to a beautiful rural village ? no ! however if you own a car with gprs . you can go to every corner on the world . second . what kind of people buy private car in our country ? the answer is wealthy people . now the number of the rich mushroom , and these rich eagerly want to buy a car when they were in a poor status . becuase they think a car especially a high-ranked car can show their status . in the common estate where i am living . when i wa very young , i could see few car paking in the estate . as i grow up , i can see more and more car begin to park below my building . now the parking area ha been fulled with car . what doe that mean ? that mean the living standard in my estate can show the whole city living stantard is growing . with rapid economic growth in our country , i hold that in our country there will be more and more car , and so doe it in the world . third . though a lot of people are complaining about the fact that car 's emission will cause the green house effect and traffic jam during the rush hour during the day , i believe these problem will be solved in the near future , because the car manufacterers are inventing new-concept car which cover le area and without any carbon dioxide emission . these car will definetely attacts more people to buy . fourth . pocessing a private car can have more privacy which a lot of people concern about . in the public transportation , your behavior is limited . to all of these factor , car have a lot pf advantage , people in the future will more likely to choose their own car rather than taking the public transportation . so i believe that there will be more car in use than there are today . of course , i will buy a car for my self in the near future .
