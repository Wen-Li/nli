in our daily life fact ha a domination on our automated behaviour . because most people do n't spend much time on intellectual activity . they are getting up early , having breakfast , going to work , after their work they coming to home back and this loop go on . but if a person must want to be a real human , he/she must spent some time in the world of idea , because what make it different from animal . before a fact became a fact it first be shaped in our mind . after creating an idea we can give it life and make it real . we put some goal in our brain , for example going to mars after 20 year . is this a fact ? of course not . but going to the moon wa not a fact too until someone deciding to achive this challenging idea . so if we want to do something we must start from conceptualization of what we want to do . another fact about fact is they are passive for u . it is a result of a proccess and what shape the proccess is idea . so we can say that thinking is cause and fact is result . in this point of view , if we want to educate creative and active student we must not fill their brain with passive fact , instead we must teach them how to think and conceptualize new , brave and challenging idea . in sum , being a a human we are living both with idea and fact . but teaching only fact without their background information can not achieve a permanent learning on student . and a student who doe not know how to create new concept ha no meaing in education .
