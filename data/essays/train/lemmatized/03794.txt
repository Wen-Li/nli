more and more young people today are often considered a the kind of people who always think about themselves not someone else . they always think they are busy doing some very important thing , so they do n't need to think about spending their free time to helping their community , even though many expert inspire young people to do so and mention many time about that they can learn many thing from the activity . so according to the writing question , my answer is that i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i have two reason to support my idea . firstly , young people today are too selfish to consider other people 's feeling and see other people 's need . it is just like what i mentioned before . they always think they are so special people in their mind that they may think other people need to give them some service for sure . to cuase the result may be that most parent today spoil or treat their child too much well , and forget to remind them the old saying : giving is better than taking . so it is esay to understand why young people do n't want to spend enough time for their community . the another reason is that our educational system too much emphasize that if student have a good grade in studying and then they will have more opportunity to have a successful future that is waiting for them . so now young student have a `` good '' excuse to decline the activity about spending time to help their community . in fact , it is not a good situation for young people 's growth , so government and parent need to think about the issue more serious .
