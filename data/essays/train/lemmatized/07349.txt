i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , especilly for those young people which are born in the 1980s in china . the logic of consuming ha a great difference between the young people and the old people . nowadays , the young people prefers to the brand product a lot . for instance , one of my roommate like wearing sport shoe , and he spends nearly 3000 rmb to buy the 3 pair of nike shoe a time . 3000rmb mean no more than a month 's salary for him , but it equal one-year expense of his old father and mother living in the countryside . the young people like traveling far away during their spare time or public holiday , but the old people usually do not go out of city for saving the cost . my colleague ha been to yunan province with his new girl friend during this year 's national holidays , they have been to there for 7 day , cost them about 6000rmb . he also suggest his father and mother go with them . but when these two old people considering the big expense , they tell their son that they only want to climb the mountain nearby . the young people usually pan the career by attending a lot of differenting training , the spend their money for the excuese of better career in the future . the old people often save their small money and accumulate by depositing in to the bank , they want to leave this money to their following generation .
