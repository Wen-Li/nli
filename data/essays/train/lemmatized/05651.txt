to my mind it is not correct to say that one had to take every risk to be successful . maybe it is easier to become famous with a revolutionally idea and a change or even break of common rule but i think it will also work with traditionally method if you are qualified enough . the phrase `` nothing ventured , nothing gained '' might be correct in some situation of life but i think if you make up relevant and important desicions too quick and without thinking carefully about it you can easily stap in a trap . of course you should not be stubburn and close your mind against every new technology or invention . to be open-minded is one of the most important characteristic in time of globalization . but i think that it is even more important not to forget our root and listen to old people with their long year experience and the wisdom they get through it . i will present an example out of equesterian sport . during the last twenty year a mass of new , different , alternative and better methodes become popular through the mass medium . but if you see the work of a traditional trainer you often observe better success in the end . if someone try everything new , he/she can not focus on one method once . and the horse you work with will be irritated . so try out everything and take every risk is the wrong way here . if you risk everything you also can loose everything and if you built up your life on solid , traditional bottom without taking every risk you do not reach everything but you also did not loose what you already have . as a conclusion i say that sometimes it is better to do what you already know and do this perfect than always focussing on new think and take the risk .
