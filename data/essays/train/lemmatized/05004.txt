i agree that it is important for student to understand idea and concept for several reason . first , it is good to understand the idea and concept . because if they understand idea and concept , they can study more easy , and they are might interested in the idea and concept . for example , when i studied at school , my teacher did not teach idea and concept . therefore , i wa always comfused about it , and i did not understand what they want to say or what they want to teach u . therefore , i think they should teach idea and concept . second , if they understand it , they can say their opinion about these . i think that it is connect with develope about idea and concept . if they can say opinion and the opinion is good or useful , it is good to develope these . and it is goodfor student to practice saying opinion . third , if they understand idea and concept , it is might useful in their future . if they do not understand idea and concept , they are not interested in these , and they think they do not want to use in future . i think if they know idea and concept , they are going to want to learn more or they want to know fact . if teacher want student learn more , i think it is important for student to understand idea and concept .
