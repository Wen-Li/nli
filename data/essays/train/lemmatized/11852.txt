we can see many successful people is word such a bill ghates and einstine . bill ghates made a lot of money form creating a software called window and einstine made a great theory such a e = mc2 . even the way they succes is different the common thing is that they gave there entire life to built it . in my opinion successful people doesn ; t try new thing but try to develope the thing they can do well . bill ghates met his first computer when he wa 14 year old . at that time there wa two famous company called macantoshi & apple ( well later they united though ) . he tried to learn computer because if wa very interesting . later at the age of 18 before graduating he made a school computer system by himself . this kind of result wa able because he constantly developed his talent . in my opinion for succesing finding and challenging a new way is also important but constantly trying is also important . einstine is also a succesful persone is physic . his new theory about black energy , black hole , time , light and movement destroied newton and platon 's theory and made a new page is the history of physic . it is hard to believe that this huge theory wa made by a single man . in my opinion that the reasone it wa able is because he always thaught about physic . many book and research say that he thaught about physic 60 percent of his time . as you can see successful people developes there talent rather than finding a new way . to conclude i think that successful people find there talent and develope what they already know how to do rather than finding a new thing to do . it is because no pain no gain . not trying any thing and seeking for chance to succeed can never make a good result .
