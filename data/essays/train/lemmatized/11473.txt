nowadays , everyone try to be successful in his work regardless of what he or she is doing . today different statement exist what can be characteristic for successful people . some people hold the opinion that doing same thing the whole time is the best way to be successful . however , in my view , it is sometimes much more better to try new kind of working . therefore i agree with the following statement : `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . '' first of all , i try to give some example why this point of view is a good way to work . to be a successful person i have to improve my work over time . i can not realize this task with only working in the same way . therefore , it is the best way to try something new . for instance , i try to improve my skill with trying out some new program for procucing a website . despite it take much more time to work with a new programm it ha also lot of advantage . for example i am able to use different kind of tool and perhaps i am able to do thing which would not be possible for me with the normal program . on the other hand , also some disadvantage ha to be considered . first of all , trying new kind of working can also ha some risk . i am not able to know how long time my work will take . furthermore it is not possible to estimate if my work will be really effective . in sum , it is a risk to try out new kind of working . everyone who want to be successful should do this not the whole time . it is important to acquire lot of skill , but when you are doing this the whole time there is not enough time to work effective and to be successful with the result of your work .
