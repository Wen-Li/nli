i donot agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . i support my statement with the following reasoning . it is true that the life syle of man ha changed drastically over a period of time and man ha to compete against time to go on . but there are many social organisation that mainly comprise of young people who work for a good cause . for example , the blood bank in my city ha more than 1000 young people a it member . they organise blood donation camp often in the city and also provide it for free of cost . one more interesting fact about this is that most of the member are the young software professional and doctor who inspite of their busy working hour take out time for charity . another example i would like to quote here is the hiv-aids awareness programme being conducted in the village where the people are ignorant about the disease . this programme is organised and conducted by a group of young medical student of which i also form a part . we stage play explaining the spread of the disease , it dangerous effect and the preventive measure . we do all this in the weekend and we are able to bring out a considerable change in half of a village . also , there are many indians settled abroad . these nonresident young professional formed into a group and carrying so many remarkable project in their home land through proper organisation channel . this offer a best example of the concern of the young people towards their community . i personally feel that the main constraint to today 's young generation is the time but not the lack of interest to help their community . there may be a little lack of awareness in them and which requires proper stimulation . so , with all the reasoning stated above i support my view that today 's young people are not reluctant to help their soceity . afterall , today 's young generation implies the future of tommorrow .
