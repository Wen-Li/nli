many people are convinced , that the last universal genius died with humboldt , or even earlier with other great scientist , philosopher and thinker . that would mean , that today every academic field is only teaching a specified knowledge . i cant't share this opinion . as a student of political science , i consider myself a a person that is accumulating knowledge in various academic subject , not only in one specified . so an answer to this question , the old question of `` generalization '' against `` specification '' . is not really difficult to me . the most important argument in this context is large range of possibility of where you will work in future . people that study only a specific subjectonly have few variety of what to do in future . but on the other hand they are the one with the , i think , better chance to get a job anyway . it is so to say a risk to persue the path of generalization '' in job perspective . but having a broad academic background make it much more easier to handle a problem , because you will be able to make use of very different problem solving strategy , which only specific knowledge , this wo n't be that easy . but not only in carreer issue , generalization is more comprehensive . experiencing already at university ( by studying a broad variety of subject ) that life is much more than what you think it is , is a great addition to life quality . i 'm thinking of a person that is sophisticated , with good manner and that is interested in the world and the people living in it and especially in those living close around him . to come to a conclusion , generalization could play an important part in creating a better world .
