people can choose between traveling with a group of people and alone . some people prefor trip alone because they are able to enjoy travel without other 's interruption . however , i am in favor of traveling with a group escorted buy a tour guide . this is mainly because people are able to deal with a unexpected accidetns and it is easy way to get useful traveling information . first of all , people are able to ask help when they face the accident . as one might expect , one would be likely to meet the emergency while traveling . according , even though they fall in trouble , they are able to ask help to other member of group . to illustrate , according to the research by the dong-a travel , one of the most renowned travel megazine in korea , 71 % of people who travel alone experienced trouble . on the other hand , only 23 % of one who travel with group of people falled in the dangerous situation . if they had traveled with their friend , they would have avoided the emergency . furthermore , traveling with a group and tour goide is easy way to get informatin . it is obvious that travel guide have large amount of information about the new location . consequently , by traveling with guide , people are able to get useful information about the new place and exchange with group member . for instance , when i wa freshman , i traveld to the europe with my friend . i did not have any knowledge about the europe . however , one of my friend , whose major is european history , give u large amount of knowledge related to the europe . if i had traveld alone , i would not got the useful information . in brief , i stongly agree with the idea that travel with a group led buy a tour guide is best way to enjoy travel . this is laregely because , individual are able to avoid the emergency and are able to get useful information easily . all in all there is a saying , `` the more , the merrier .
