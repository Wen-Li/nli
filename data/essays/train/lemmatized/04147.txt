media and advertisement have one goal : to promote and sell their product . this directly implies that they need to make their product attractive , which is sometimes not the truth . to make their product or service attractive , they need to make the consumer , the client , the fixed public , feel like they need it or want it . yes i believe that most advertisement need to make product seem better than what they truly are . special skill are needed in different area to make a product more attractive . you need a publicist , who will advertise the product where it would find the most adequate public for the product . the people that are more probable to buy it . you also need a promoter , who is not much different than the publicist , or an advertiser , whose sole purpouse is to sell it . whether he need to luy or transofrm the truth about the object , not doing so would make him unworthy of his job . you also need a technician , a designer , a whole team that can create the right material for the publcist to be able to promote the good . this can be teh photographer that take sthe pictrue of the object a well a the person behind the computer that edits the photo so it can appear even appealing to the eye . yes there are also many aspect of teh object to improve for it to be able to sell . such a making it appealing to the widest public possible . you also need to make it attractive to eye , so that when the client see it he can imagine himself using it or simple having it . the photo or video ha to make the object look beautiful . my point is that there are whole study field , technical team , and career that specialize in making thing seem much better than they are . if there are class that teach how to do so this statement must be true . and if career are offered in such field than it 's becaus etehy need professional .
