nowadays it 's clearly impossible to run away from advertisement . at home or on the street , even when you drive a car you may see advertisement on bus . it seems to be very difficult to escape from it . but what are advertisement made for ? usually they are made to attract peaple or to get their attention and finnaly to sell the product which the advertisement is made for . many peaple complain about the way advertisement is presented . they see every kind of advertisement a an illusion of good that in fact do n't represent what is said about them . but do advertisement make product better then they really are ? if you consider most of the advertisement you may discover afterwards that they do n't lie but they hide information . for example in some advertisement they claim that their yoghurt ha a lot of vitamin that make you healthy . unfortunately the same yoghurt ha alos a lot of fat and ohter ingredient that can do harm your body . this is a big problem for every consumer and for the government a well because it is pretty diffucult to find a solution for it . you ca n't prohibit company to do advertisement . so the hidden information will be existing also in the future . furthermore advertisement is seen a everything that appears on screen that is shown between film or series . so whats about cigarette ? in germany for example cigarette are shown in advertisment a a cause of cancer and a lot of other illness . this is a kind of advertisment that doe n't make the product better . it doe the opposite by showing how harmful cigarette are . nevertheless advertisement is there to get peaples attention to buy a product . . how can you reach this goal many company ask themselves . one option is advertisement , and a there is so much competition company have to invent fact that make it more interesting . as we know that most thing said in advertisments are not true we know that this is just a stragey to catch the peaples eye and make them interested in their product . in my opinion it 's true that most advertisement make product much better than they really are . despite the exception mentioned above , advertisement us wrong or different fact to improve their product .
