many people think that the best period in life for trying new thing and taking more risk in the job is the period in which this job is successful . in my opinion this is absolutely right , even though there are other event and situation that could get a person to take a risk . of course , risk should be taken in the time when a person is stable enough , both in private and economical aspect , to succeed in facing the possible consequence that the action could cause . with reference to this , people tend not to take risk while they already have a difficult situation , like for example the foundation of a new work activity or a problem in the family . however , this is not a rigid and strict rule : sometimes people could have to take risk beause the situation itself force them to do it ; similarly , someone could decide to take a risk because in his opinion the result of this action is highly predictable . trying new thing is in some way like betting : maybe you do n't know wether you 'll win or not , but anyway your duty is to be in the best condition to risk , and then to prepare to acknowledge the result . another thing that affect this choice is the success itself : people try to prove their value , doing new thing that they previously did n't know ; in this way , the diversification of a business activity can demonstrate what eventually a person can achieve and do well : if you succeed again , you 're a winner ; otherwise , you 're just a loser . it 's like a challenge that people accept to take . of course the statement doe n't only refer to the business situation : people act and follow their desire to challange theirselves also in the everyday and private life . this reasoning is part of the life of all human being , and normally help them to develop and improve , or at least to learn something from a bad experience .
