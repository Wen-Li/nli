when we are asked if it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject then to specialize in one specific subject we reach a great problem . first of all we must be aware that knowing everything about every subject in the world is definitely impossible , so , if the choice is to have a limited knowledge in a large number of subject or a good knowledge in one subject only , we are tempted to take the second choice . nowadays we can find so many specialization class in university that consequently the request for job is becoming more and more specialized . so we understand that a specialization in one subject is actually inevitable , but it is more likely for worker to have a broad knowledge about different subject because this knowledge is very important in the formation of a man 's experience a an individual . therefore , having a good general knowledge is important in people working life , where different ability are often required in addition to a great ability in your own specialization . in addition to it , it is true that a high knowledge of one subject make easier for people to be hired for specific job , but it is also true that this will limit a lot your chance to get a work a little different from the one you have been so specificly trained for . having a good general knowledge help also in social context , because if a parson with a grat specific knowledge is highely considered in the strict environment of his subject , a person with a good broad knowledge will be kept in high consideration among common people in common context of situation . to conclude , in my opinion , though nowadays a higher and higher specific knowledge is required in our modern working context , it is basicly important to have a good broad knowledge , to succeed in the whole of the context of our life .
