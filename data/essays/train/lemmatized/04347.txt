try new thing and take risk are part of the life of everybody . but in the last time even more successful people are trying to superate the limit . there are more reason , i will mention only three because of the time . the first one regard the style of life of the successful people . they have a good job and also money . they can permit themeselves whatever they want even that they do not need it . money is very dangerous for people . they are sure they can do what they want and when they wnat and sometimes it is the best way to lose the right road . as a second reason there is the fact that if you do every day the same you will be boring with the time . and when people are boring they look for something new and different . sometimes the result of this research can be dangerous and take risk for their proper life . if a businessman go free climbing without enough experience only because he is boring in his office he doe not take the right decision , because it is a dangerous sport . as third reason the last but not the least , it can happen that people will demonstrate what they can also if they can not and are not able ! it is frequent by successful people , i think because they need to feel better than others . this feeling can bring them to do thing , what they do not know how to do , only to be and to feel the first one or the best one . in conclusion , i agree with the statement because it is based on my own experience . all the reason i mentioned are fact i have experienced with people around me . it is not a surprising effect of the society we are living in , but educated and intelligent people shall not do thing only to demonstrate something to the others , what unfortunately happens .
