nowadays young people give not enough time to helping their community . but there are several point to consider before judging them . firstly the expectation to the young people are high . school requires a lot of learning and working on homework . the same task are maintained at the university level . that mean that `` work '' not always end in regular time pattern and it hard to reserve a certain time of the week for community work . also they might participate in several additional course of the university , like sport , choir or art project , which is also a time-intensive hobby . and therefore , are they not helping a community with these hobby - they are helping the university community . furthermore it is important to register , that many young people do not life in one community and are asking themselves what is `` their '' community . for example student might spend a lot of time in university and at home . in the most case this are two different community . therefore they can not identify enough with either community and it is hard to convice somebody to sacrifice a lot of otherwise free time to something that he doe not consider himself part of or responsible for . another aspect is that nowadays maturity and the developement into an adult take more time . many young people still play a lot of computer game and have rather childish hobby at an age , in which they would be expect to have a work an be more independent from their parent . and the sozial attitude to help others is rather found in adult finally there is the point about family . the family is also an community and it should be the most important one . the most young people marry at the age of twenty-six or even older . so can you expect somebody who is still busy settling his most important , personal community right accuse for spending too le time for others community ? so in the end , on first sight many young people may not enough or even no community work . but if one considers the circumstance of our lifestyle and the expectation of the modern , many young people do enough for their community despite all their other challenge .
