i disagree to this statement , for few reason and especially when i am travelling in a new country or area : first of all , travelling in a group led by a tour guide can be a very limited way to discover a new place . most of the time everything is schedule in advance so no time to meet people , exchange , to really be in contact with the population . the best way to know a country can only be guaranted by taking his time , deciding to stay more time to a very interesting place . a travel with a tour guide doe n't give this flexibility , . also , many travel with a tour guide will result by visit very commerical area . i remember doing this kind of trip in quebec , we visited a `` first nation '' site near quebec city and by listening to the tour guide , this site wa the only place where people wa still living like a century ago . but i move in quebec 2 year later and talk about it to my co-worker , and of course i discover it wa just an area for the `` touristes '' . so what i am trying to explain by this exemple , is the risk to be shown something who is not the reality and to whom the purpose is only the money . finally the last reason i disagree with this statement , is that only the fact to travel in a group of unknown people is a risk . it 's difficult to know how people will react between each other by spending time together for a minimum of a week .
