helping community is a great thing to do and there are many people involved in this `` job '' with the aim of substaining and helping a much a they can . usually this help come from the curches and from the charity association a a volunteer ' occupation and it 's very useful and gratefying . but if we look with more accurancy we can see that the people that work there , are usually middle age - old people that thing that spending more time there is better than wating time . so it 's true that the young people do n't do enough for their communieties . instead of staying hour in front of the computer waiting for something more interesting they should go out and do something useful and important for their communietes . it is n't an hard work . for example , it mean going to the church 's playfield and help the mother to control their child , help an old woman to buy her dinner at the supermarket or help an old man to take his dog out . frankly it 's nothing so difficult to do . personally i think that working in charity shop or helping people in difficult it 's more gratefying than how they think . these stuations should help them to be more sensitive in front of these people but especially to understand the importance of their occupation . this way a young boy/girl is going to face the real problem and the real situation that could happen during their life . and i think that there is nothing better to be prepared about what could happen in the future .
