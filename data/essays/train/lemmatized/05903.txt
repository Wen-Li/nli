since the begining of life , poeple stood shoulder to shoulder in order to obtain and secure the primitive source to survive . with thie time change and era follow year , the demand of helping and building up community increased dramaticly . it not only helping to survive and getting food any more , it about being an active member to afford lexurity of life and improve a life style not only for the indivisual , but for the society a well . young people who obtain the right education and got rasied upon to certain manner are always awared for the fact that they have to contribute into the society in a potant way . they know that they have to give a thay have been given other wise the circle would not keep on going on . it is not hidden that the challenge in life are increasing more than before . it is also well known that with the high level of competetion the demand for more engagments is becoming a most on order to compete and survive . with this mad rush for being thursty for the autherity and the confusion politics create , time is becomine more valuable . time factor is being an issue . regardless of the fact that an indivisual want to help or not , it still obveious having the time to do so is not a easy . a young indivisual doe have alot of responsibility and duty to do now . he ha to attend an educational program , a job to perfom along with many other social bond of which he ha to fulfill . i believe those engagments youth are doing are part of helping the community . without an adequate education a guy would n't be able to obtain a good job . without those factor he would n't be able to start a good family with healthy well mannered kid . a guy who doe n't attend family gathering is totaly being out from the basic social life of which would affect him psychologicly and it would affect his over all performance . finally , i believe everyone is helping in his own way . we just have to make sure we are helping right .
