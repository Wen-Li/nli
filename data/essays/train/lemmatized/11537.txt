i generaly try to hire a good guide tour during my vacation if my budget agrees with it . on one hand you could save this money to be in a better hotel , but on the other hand you can make your trip a lot more worthy . usually the major purpose of a trip is to visit a new different country from our own and to learn from an other culture . it 's a lot of investment to get to a foreign country , and with a tour guide you can improve the benefit of your trip . let me explain now how : a local tour guide will be able to make you feel the culture , and to bring you to none touristical place , which will make you feel really in the country . he will also explain you a lot of historical event that you would have never heard about it and it will maybe create a new interest in this particular country or culture . i went to japon a few month ago with my japanese piano teacher and a good friend of mine . if i had been alone , it would have been a complitly different and le meaningful trip for me . we first lived in a local family , and the guide helped u to be more and more curious about everything we could and of course communicates with local people . it ha really been a great life changing experience to learn a hole different culture , habit and way of thinking . i can assure you that i would just remember the nice beach next to our hotel if my piano teacher would n't have come . i 'm now proud to know a little more about asian culture , and when people asked me `` what did you gain from this trip '' , i wa happy not to answer `` the sun burnt me , it look good no ? '' .
