having broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than specializing in one specific subject seems more difficult to me due to several reason . let me state my reason . first of all , specializing in one specific event or subject may take a lifetime . i , for instance , want to specialize in marketing and in order to do so , i will have to have my mba , phd and still work on learning . i can not say that '' ok , i have been reading and learning about marketing for 20 year and i know everything . '' this is impossible because evey year , new book and new method are introduced to the market . learning about one subject never end up . secondly , it is not useful to know more than one topic or subject on the surface . you may have knowledge about other topic but you do one thing good . it is like playing basketball and football at the same time . it would be impossible for you to find enough time to sacrifice yourself for the well being of any issue . if this topic wa possible , i would have one techer in my whole life , trying to teach me everything . but i had math . teacher , marketing teacher , finance teacher and so on . all were specialized in their field and had depth knowledge of their intererst . to sum up , having broader knowledge of many academic subject seem unuseful to me . specializing is much more prefered . in usa , the biggest economy in the world today , specialization at university is the primary method and they owe their success to this approach . i would go for specialization .
