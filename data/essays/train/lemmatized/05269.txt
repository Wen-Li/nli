i disagree with the statement that young pepole nowadays do not give enough time to helpling teir community . there are two reason . one is the recognization of the importance of volunteer in disaster and the other is preparing for aging society . first , the importance of volunteer have been recognized among young people recently . for example , strong earthquake hit the hanshin and awazi area in 1995 . tv news show broadcasted the situation and many young people shoked with the situation of the area . at that time , many young volunteer went to those area and worked for the community . tv news show also broadcasted those young volunteer . as a result , many young people have realized the importance of working for the society . so many young people have started to think about the community in emergency since the disaster . second , population in japan is aging very rapidly and also inferred more and more in the future . even now there are many older people in japan , it is also estimated that about one third of the japanese population will be the people over aged 65 in 2050 . some older people are healthy , but some are not . unhealthy older people usualy need help to do their daily work . so many young people nowadays think that they must work for the older people . for example , nursely home insurance system ha been introduced in japan in 2000 . people have thought about helping only their parent before . but aging of society caused people to think not only their parent but also many older people in their community . this made the japanese government introduce that system . in the system , many young pepole are taking part of helping the older people in the community . so many young people are concerning with helping them . for these reason , i disagree with the statement that young pepole nowadays do not give enough time to helpling teir community .
