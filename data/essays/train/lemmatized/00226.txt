although it would be a good thing for the environment if there were fewer car in the future , i do not think this will happen . three argument convince me that there will be even more car in the near future . in the first place , most of u rely on their car to easily go to every place whenever it may be desireable . i am sure that no one will change this behaviour , unless he or she is forced to do so . i do not think everyone will suddenly use the bus or the train , because most of u would feel a if their mobility or personal right to move were restricted . therefore , there will not be fewer car within 20 year . additionally , the number of car is a global affair . i recently read an article about the emerging state in the far east , which mentioned the fact that people in country like china are about to having gathered enough wealth to afford car . imagine a billion person from this region , who suddenly drive a car ! so , even if the developed country would reduce their reliance on car , the number of car would actually increase . quite on the contrary , one might argue that global society will have no choice but to use fewer car in the future because of a shortage of oil . but i think that mankind will finally overcome this concern , at least when it is forced to do so , by using alternative energy . these technology are already available today , but are not being used extensively for several reason . eventually , when cheap oil is now longer available , car producer will switch , because of the people ' reliance mentioned earlier . consequently , the number of car will not drop significantly . in conclusion , i predict that the number of car will rise instead of decline . i would feel a lot better with that , if people would take more care of their environment and use green car today , even if they are a bit more expensive .
