i agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . the twenty first century is accompanied with a lot of growth and development in science . globalisation ha led to a lot of country coming to our country and trading here . this is generally seen to leave an impact on people . the cultural value are slowly fading away from our society . young people are given the responsibility to help their community move ahead and have a strong stand in the society . unfortunately , the younger generation ha failed to divide their time and use it to the fullest . the culture are changing at a very high pace . it is seen that the young people want to take an easier path and go with the flashy stuff . little do they realise that by doing this they will eventually let their community to fade away in the longer span of life . they are so impressed by other lifestyle and community that they forget their responsibility . people are migrating to different country . most of the country have formed a group of a certain community people . but , it is seen that there are very few who work whole-heartedly for their community . others , usually either do n't have time or are reluctant to help . it is also seen that the younger generation lack the sense of responsibility . they have taken it rather too lightly . they will have time to go to a party with friend or go to a holiday with the family but find it too difficult to take out time for community development . helping out their community is rather a kind of formality for them . they might pay the yearly allowance but never care to go and check if it actually being used to the fullest . even if they make it a point to attend to it at certain interval and make some improvement , it would make a lot of improvement . what is required is their full support and their idea to help it flourish . they should realise that it is a kind of an investment . this will never go waste . the more they will help , the more the next generation is going to benefit from it . this should give it importance because if not looked upon now , the value will become extinct sometime . no-one will care for their origin . it will come a a setback later . the hardwork of our ancestor should not go waste .
