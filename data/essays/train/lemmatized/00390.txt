in my opinion , the statement given is partly true and partly false . although the sense of community service ha decresed to some extent among the young people , the number of people who conciously take up community service ha not decreased . i would like to support my view with the following reasoning . firstly , i think that this statement is not completely true because , in the past , community service wa mandatory in many country . for example , in germany , every individual had to serve in the army for a minimum of two year . this wa not a concious decision taken by the individual but by the government . presently , there is no such rule . so , when it come to statistically comparing the number of individual who on their own , take up community service of some kind or the other , there is no big change in the number . also , in the past , the number of people who remained dedicated to community service is very small compared to the number of young people who were exposed to it . secondly , the reason why i think the statement is valid to certain extent is : due to a drastic change in the pace of life in the present era of globalization , young people spend most of their time building up their career and catching up with the rapidly changing world . in this process , they find very le time to devote to community service . and even if they do devote some time , it is not a concious effort . that is , because of the le time they get to devote to community service , young people do not understand the joy , purpose and responsiblity involved in the process of community service . so , to certain extent the stament is infact true . to sum up , i would like to state that statement is partly false because the percentage of people commiting to community service these day is more or le the same a the percentage of people who conciously commited to community service in the past . also , the statement is partly true to a certain extent in putting forward that young people these day do not involve in service because of the reason put forward above .
