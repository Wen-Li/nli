is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , or to have a more specific subject specialization ? first , i think that this question is quite difficult . in fact , in france we use to have plenty of different course , therefore a we come at the age of about twenty , it appears to be a good thing . that is to say , i got a basic knowledge on a lot of different thing , and i am capable to understand basic problem or discusions , for instance on radio . and i feel glad of it . but , of course , a broad knowledge ha also got drawback . actually when i wa a child , i thought it wa a wast of time learning how human being descovered fire , how dna function . it is hard to interest somebody in a subject that is not it cup of tea . thereas a specific learning can really be a good way of catching attention . thus student , that just focuse on a specific problem , are really aware of it , and when time come for them to work , they are efficient . i think that a reason of the american power , and the fact that often american search recieve the nobel price . however , i believe that a good balance between a specific topic and a broad culture is the best . in france we generaly agree that americans do not even know where europe stand . i think it certainly is a prejudice , but it reviels may be that we can not just consider a single subject whitout considerating the world in which we all are . to conclude , i would say that a balance policy in teaching is almost impossible to find , but i do trust that both a broad view of the world suroundings u and a specific culture are a wounderful utopia .
