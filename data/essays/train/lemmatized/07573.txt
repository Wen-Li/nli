i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . having a broad knowledge , it would help people find a better career and have a wide range of choice to choose from especially for student . having a broad knowledge of academic subject , student will be able to choose a best fitting career for them . for example my friend always had great interest in geology , but had no such class in highschool and could n't find anyone to teach him in such area . soon he changed his interest to studying history . if he had more knowledge and a person to talk with about other subject including geology , he could have been happier . specializing in only one subject , student might have a hard time finding a job if all the opening are filled with other expert . by then it would be too late to start studying for a different subject . of course it is not bad to be an expert in a subject . actually it is a brilliant thing . but i think it would be better if people were aware of alittle bit of everything than concentrating on a specific subject for exmaple studying in college , student should try to take many kind of class a possible to build information and then from the knowledge collected over the year , find a job that interest them most . i believe having broad knowledge about various subject will also help u out with surviving on earth . there is a saying in korean , ` a frog in a well . ' a frog in a bottom of the well only see the little circular sky , which is opened at the top and doe n't relize what is happening beyond . the frog see the little sky a everything on earth . i agree that people should have broad knowledge of subject than specializing in one specific subject .
