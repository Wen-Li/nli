i do n't absolutely agree with the statement . i study at university since i wa 19 year old and in these three year i 've understood how ha been important to have choosen one specific subject to study . usually the most important university offer a lot of course : each one belongs to a specific subject . for instance , i study `` transport and logistics engineering '' , that is a particular aspect of the world of engineering . this doe n't mean that i do n't study the basic subject of engineering ( a mathematic analysis , phisics , statystics etc . ) : i study these subject the same , but perhaps i study only their basic aspect . if i had to study all the aspect of all the subject , i think i would n't have the time to do anything else , because it would require me too much time . consider that now i study 8 hour a day at university and 6 hour a day at home . moreover i spend 2 hour to go to university from home : how could i find the time to study every particular aspect of every subject ? i think i would become mad ! . so , i think that knowing a lot of thing is beautiful , but at the end it is impossible . this is also because the university try to prepare student for the job they will do in the future . this job usually belongs to one or few subject studied at university . so why do i have to study more and more subject ? i talk you about my experience . the aim of my course is to prepare student to solve transport and logistics problem within a few time . this is very important for u , because in this way we avoid to study some subject and instead we can concentrate on the most important one , in other word the most `` operative '' one , that comprehend the knowledge that actually we must have when we 'll do our job . for all these reason , i confirm that i completely disagree with the statement .
