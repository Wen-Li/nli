i surely agree ! .. i am not happy to know this thing , but it is the truth . advertising is made to convince people that a product is better then all the others . nowdays the answer is fewer than purpose , so company need to advertise their product to sell them . in this cetury , or better in the last fifty year the diffusion of mass medium all over the world and the born and capillar diffusion of television are the best `` friend '' of advertising 's lie . there are a lot of psicology study about human behavior to constuct a perfect advertise . there are also some way to test if an advertise ha been remembered by the pubblic or not . somebody make a lot of research about behavior in the super matrkets or into the commercial center , too . nowdays yoo can assert that adverisements do not sell a product but they sell a dream . they imply . .. fulfill that dream is easy : `` you only need to buy thath product or servce ! '' however in the real life is different becuse what television spot suggest you , it doe not occur . for example the washing product never function on their own and at the first time yuo use them . . when you wash something , usually you need to wash it more and moer to clean if not it rest with rubbish on ! as i have arleady wrote i am not happy about this thing but i hope that people will chaege this way to sell . . i do not know how people can change this thing but i am sure that is occur in few year .
