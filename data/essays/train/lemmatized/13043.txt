i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . though i think that the choice should be made depending on each person 's individaul personanlity and preference , there are more disadvantage of taveling in a group than traveling alone . for one thing , i believe that some people do not like being in a group . for those people . traveling in agroup will be very uncomfortable . i have many friend who do not want to be in a group . they may need more free time to relax and meditate by themselves . second , traveling group people can not decide where to go or what to eat on their own . they should cooperate with other member and somtimes they should give up their choice for the schedule of group . i have an example from my own personal experience . i wa traveling in italy in a group with a guide . the guide asked which restaurant people wanted to enter for lunch . malority of people wanted to have italian pizza while i wanted to have stake . i should have to give up stake becuase i wa the only person who wanted it . if i had traveled alone , this kind of thing would never have happend . third , moving in group can not a fast and efficient a moving alone . for example , people should wait until all the member get together and it is not easy to find space for many people in restaurant or theater . one of friend told me her terrible experienc of travel . when she traveld china in a group , one of the member wa lost in the great wall and all the other people wasted time finding the person and they gave up rest of schedule . but i also admit that traveling in a group led by guide have some advantage . for example , i do not have to study how to travel or what to prepare because the guide will do it for me . i do not have to worry what if i am lost , either . but more research on the traveling country will give me more sense of achievement after finishing traveling . traveling in a group led by a tour guide involves a lot of disadvantage , le free time , le option to chose and le efficiency of movement . though it can be more convenient to be led by a guide , one should sacrifice those thing for convenience . lastly , i believe that completing traveling by oneself will give him or her more sense of achievement with more exposure to the country they travel . so , i can not agree with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
