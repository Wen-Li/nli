every person enjoys life in his or her own way . though , i personally believe that youngster enjoy life more than older people do . firstly , the reason why i think so is that a we grow older the responsibility we have only get more and more . for example , when i wa a kid studying nursery i didnt have any resposibility at all or for that matter very le . when i wa in high school i had to study well to get admission into a good college . then in high school i had to get decent grade and also had to help my parent in their work . though it wa not a burden for me , it surely wa a responsibility which i had to do a their daughter . as a person grows their responsibility also grow , not just a an individual but also a a person in the family and in the soceity . also most of the youngster tend to take life in a lighter way than the older people . so we enjoy that phase of our lifethe most . the older people have already undergone thing in life , that make them plan for their future in a certain way or save money for their family . but the young people tend to spend their money on luxurious thing or on more enjoyable thing . for instance , when i wa in college i used to spend most of my money on shopping and stuff . that wa enjoyment for me then . but now i realise the importance of saving money for the future and i shop only when i have the need for it . another important point i 'd like to mention is that enjoyement lie in the way we perceive it . most of the young people do not have anything major to worry about . they enjoy the life they are living , doing thing at their own pace . all they have to bother about is their study . this is not the case with the older people . their life are more or le very stressful , be it due to family problem or tension in the work place . in conclusion , i would say that a person enjoys his life the most when he is young .
