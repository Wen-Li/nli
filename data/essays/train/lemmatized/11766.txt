in the 1960 , taylorism made it apparition . taylorism like fordism were new organizational stuctures for enterprise , where each employee wa specialized in one task . the consequenses of this new type of organization led to the increase of the turnover of company . but can we state that specialization in knowledge is better than broad knowledge of many subject ? specialization in one specific subject can be really an advantage , in my opinion , when the subject is a rare one . moreover , i believe that for a very specific and detailed subject , someone who is interested to make it his profession , should specialize his self a much a he can . i explain this position by the fact that for rare subject where few people have the knowledge and only few people can work on it , specialization will be the main advantage in front of competitor in the same domain . the specialization can present , in contradictory with the previous paragraph , some disadvantage . indeed , by specializing ourselves , we can adapt to a new job with more difficulty . flexibility and the ability to adapt is one the main criterias for management . furthermore , in management , being specialized in an industry , a type of job , a department or a task make u too difficult to change job and can be a constraint for our evolution in the company . we need to specialize ourselves , but not too much otherwise we become rigid . in conclusion , i believe that we need to have a balance between specialization and broad knowledge of many academic subject . we have to find the correct balance between the two in order to be flexible and adaptable , in order to be able to response to any problem that appears but also specialiazed in one topic to have the best knowledge in front of competitor .
