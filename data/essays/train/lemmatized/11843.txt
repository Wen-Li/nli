i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to unterstand idea and concept rather than just learning fact . i believe this , because student will gain a higher level of education that they need in their job and they will also have a higher motivation to learn . the first point is that i think student should understand academic model , idea and concept in order gain a higher educational level . when understanding a theoretical model , a student will be able to apply it to the real world even if the real world doe not exactly match the theory and it assumption and implication . for example , when just memorizing and recalling fact , a student might not be able to make a proper decision in the real world because some assumption or condition have changed since the fact were learned . this way , a student will not be able to customize his decision to the new situation when using her knowledge . so , a student who understands the theory and get react to new development can achieve by far more in her job , which is ulitmately the goal of education , namely to prepare for the work another good reason for understanding idea and concept is that student will most likely have a higher motivation to learn and therefore learn more . in contrast to memorize fact and recalling them , understanding an idea is le boring than a process of memorizing , which is repeated over and over again . when i wa in school i did not like to just learn fact , and propably everybody else i knew did not like it , we all learned far more thing when understanding a theory , which support my point here . to sum up , it is far more important to understand the idea and concept of the matieral that should be leard , rather than just fact . the reason are the higher level of education with a significantly higher chance to suceed in work and the better motivation of student which will yield to more knowledge .
