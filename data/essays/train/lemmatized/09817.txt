people will always ask themselves what 's the best way of learning thing and what 's the best way of teaching thing because these question are essential . the world evolves and so doe the way of teaching , education is one of the most important thing because although it may sound a little bit ` cliche` , today 's child are tomorrow 's adult , hence , it is wise to ask ourselves if understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact , when i thing about it , there 's no good answer at this kind of question because understanding concept and learning fact are both important . of course if you study philosophy , understanding idea is vital and if you study law you 'll have to learn fact but in most of other field the best thing to do is to understand and learn . when i wa in highschool i hated learning fact because it wa extremely boring , i thought that what mattered the most wa understanding what the teacher were talking about , that 's why i wa always paying attention in class but since i hated fact i wa n't studying much at home . i wa an average student with average grade but i think that had i spent more time learning basic fact i could have had much better grade . of course only learning fact is n't very helpfull if you do n't understand concept . some people only care for fact and could n't care le about what 's behind them , i think it 's quite sad because you ca n't base your opinion on fact alone , you have to understand what 's the true meaning of the fact you 're looking at , now , when i learn a fact i always try to understand the idea that it 's implying and when i come to understand a concept i try to learn some fact that can be related to it , in a word , i think that student should understand concept and learn fact , they should n't have to choose between both .
