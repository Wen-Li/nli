in our society , where advertisement are everywhere , one can wonder if company do not try to convince u that some of their product are much better than what they really are . we will first discus why it is sometimes true , then why company can not really cheat , and finally , we will explain why it ha no real importance in our society . it is a commonly shared idea that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . as a matter of fact , the aim of an advertisement is to sell a product . therefore , when a company want to sell a product , it can be more efficient to make potential customer believe that it is better than what it really is . in our society , for example , design is widely used to make u buy thing that we do not really need : the lack of efficiency of a product can be hidden by it design , or by the picture and text shown in the advertisement . for example , company like apple greatly rely on design to sell them product . one can wonder : `` why doe this company need so to spend so much in advertisement ? is the product not worth it cost ? '' . obiously , the way some product are presented in advertisement make them appear better than what they really are : advertisement for pasta always show them cooked with delicious sauce ; advertisement for burger always show u big , perfect burger , whereas everyone know they do not look at all like this when we go to mac donald 's ! but on the other hand , cheating with the actual quality of a product is not effective in a long term commercial strategy . obviously , people who bought a product because they believed it wa much better than what it effectively is , will not buy it another time . this is why company know that they can not cheat too much . moreover , there are several law concerning advertisement : lying in an advertisement is forbidden for instance . for example , we can see on old guiness advertisement , `` guiness is good for you . gives you strength '' . such advertisement , which were common in the early 1900s , ha completely vanished because law have been voted to prevent this . the most important think is , i believe , that a we all perfectly know our society , we all more or le know when advertiser lie to u and when they do not . even we often see monster jump out of cereal on the television ( like for instance the tiger from frosties ) , we know that it will not happen for real . in the same way , we do not believe that some product will remove every kind of dirt on any clothing .
