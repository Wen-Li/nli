no , i disagree , that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one subject specialization is highly prefered according to me because knoweledge is like a ocean . what ever we learn will be a drop in the ocean , so it imposiible to persue in many acedamics . the better way is to take single subject . we can observe some sort of grip and confidence in people who specialized . they can even go deeper and study for further research and gain name and fame in le peroid oftime . they can also share that knowledge to younger generation in a better way because of thier high confidence level over subject . after finishing thier study , it will be easier for specialised person to choose his path . he will be prefered than others by company because company people think that he can do work better in that paticular feild . he get the skill of innovation , work hard , and try to concentrate on his subject . since he is free to choose subject of intrest he will persue with zeal and eager . he will be more clear about his future plan . there wa a saying that `` jack of all , master of none '' .this surely happen if person enters in to many academic . the main reason people forget one if they learn another . if a person enters in the many feilds there chance of confusion and finally end up in to mess . researcher also conveyed that people concentrating on different subject can not gain anything . the more broader you go the le you will learn . according tomy opnion it is better to master in the single subject than making all the stuff included in the brain . by this his undrstands his aim and work to reach goal . he will get good fame
