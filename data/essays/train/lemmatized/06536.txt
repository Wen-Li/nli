how can you judge or measure , if someone enjoying his life or is happy . i think you ca n't generalise that young people enjoy their life more than old people . you al ca n't say wether rich or poor people are more happier . the first thought is maybe that young people like child or teenager could be enjoying their life more than older people do , because they do n't have to care about such a lot thing like their parent , like paying the bill , shop some food , going to work etc . it appears that young people have more free time , what give them the ability to do many thing they like an enjoy . but in every part of your life there are certain typically thing you worry about . for example a teenager ha to grow up , find out what type of human he is , what he like or dislike , make experience with the other gender . that can bring joy and pain . the most people look at their childhood and believe it wa a very good time , but the most do n't want to make certain experience again . although in your later life you normally got more work to do and more thing to worry about you could enjoy this special part of your life . one other thing why older people could enyjoy their life le , is maybe that they do n't have family and are alone . sure on the one hand it happens to old people that their friend die and they have no family , but on the other hand there are so much example of old people , who are stille married and still have a lot of friend and famlily . in my opinion happyness and joy can not be categorised by such thing like age , gender or the money you have . your life and every part of it can bring you joy . everyone is responsible for his own joy , no matter how old he is . therefore i disagree with the statement .
