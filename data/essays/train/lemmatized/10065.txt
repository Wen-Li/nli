i agree because , cause their success , some egocentric people think that they can do everything , and without experience , they take experiment in other sector . this approach it cuold be dangerous because if people do n't plan their business , they could have financial problem caused by activity ' hazzard . however many succesfully-business people must try new thing and take risk because the business sector continually evolved and if you have n't avanguardian tecnologies for the production and always new idea to throw on the market , it could happen that you must close your activity . taking risk is an aspect that many economiests study , because risk ha a stimulative effect , so if worker feel stimulated himself he produce better . with this conception succesfull people take often risk so they feel to have more responsabilities than normal people and also they feel stimulated themeselves to do better and better . taking risk is a conseguence of the `` free deal ''
