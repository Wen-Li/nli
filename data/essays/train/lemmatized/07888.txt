it is usually admited that young people enjoy life more than older people do . because of their youth , people enjoy life doing many thing like travelling , going to night club , seeing friend . they often do not have health problem to deal with . they can make sport a much a they want . they believe that they have the whole life in front of them , that everything can be done . youth is the time of positive belief . contrary to this open state of mind , old people usually believe that they are too old for doing thing they used to do when they were young . however , i believe that it is not because someone is young that he or she is going to enjoy life more than someone older . it depends on the people . we are all different and we all live our life the way we want to . as an example we can take an overwhelmed situation : a seventy year old person , who ha many energy , who is open - minded and happy to live , eats well-balanced meal , who ha always done sport in his or her life , can enjoy life more than a twenty year old one who spends his or her time in front of television a a couch potato , who ha got neither friend nor job and feel unhappy . furthermore , an old person can have accumulate much more money than a young one . thus if money is important to live for both people , the older one would enjoy life much more than the younger one . finally , a sixty year old person doe not have to work anymore contrary to the twenty year old one who , then , do not have the time to enjoy life a the first one doe . as a conclusion we can say that it is not the age which make life enjoyable or not , it is rather the people , their way of living , of thinking . .. in my opinion , every people in good health can enjoy life . last but not least , we all have different way to enjoy life .
