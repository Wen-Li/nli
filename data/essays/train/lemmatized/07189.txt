traveling around the world should be a great experience because it is the time to meet people and to discover a new country . i definately disagree with the idea of traveling in group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel . regarding to my experience , i am sure that the best way to travel is with people that you love and visit the place which are not all the time indicated . first of all , every time i have traveled in a foreign contry , i wa with my friend or with my family and i have appreciated my trip better , because i wa with people who i love to share my time with . when you travel with a group you do not know the people with who you are , and this situation can be the appropriate time to have new friend , but for me , having a friend is a long story which can be counted in year . in my opinion spend my money to visit a new place is the time to share very good moment in a new atmosphere with my family and friend who know me . when i went to italy it wa with my best friend and i could appreciate much better this wonderful place . last but not least , when you travel with a tour guide you have to follow their rule whom is exactly what i dislike to do during my vacation because i must follow the rule all the time during my daily life . tour guide ha already a planning and personaly i love the idea to do not know what i am going to do the day after . this sensation is a wonderful sensation of freedom . furthermor , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to miss the best place because i am sure that every country have is spirit , which can be discovered only if you spend your time with the population and visit with their own eye . in conclusion , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way for me to visit a new place , because you have to follow their rule and because you do not know people of the group .
