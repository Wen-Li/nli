in my opinion it is much better to travel in group led by a tourguide . because the guide is knowlegble about the airea we visit , we save money and time , and we we get more information about the country we visit . first , the guide is the best person who khnow the place we like to visit . he know the trafics and the geography of the region . so there no chance that the visitor may get lost or go the wrong way . however , the guide could do better job than the map . secondly , being led by a guide is a smart way to save money and time . we can imagine how much money the person would spend if he need several taxi and bus to get the region we want to see . but traveling in group with a tour guide hepls to reduce the mailage because the tour guide may know the best way to get the point we have the plan to see in a short time and short trafic . in addition traveling in group would reduce the transportation charge . thirdly , the tour guide is the best person who know about the history of his country . in this way it more benifitial to get more information about the country we visit .
