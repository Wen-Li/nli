we can say the most of the young people ( not all of them ) enjoy life more than older once . the cause of that is that they do not bare big responsibility on there shoulder , they are only responsible of themself and most of the time they can rely on the help of the parent if they are in trouble ; this category is composed mainly composed of high school or university student . and an important factor that young 's tend to explore life more , try new experience , go place they never visited . an important factore also is the biological factore , young people have the energy to try new stuff and enjoy there life to the max . in the opposite , old people mostly have big responsibility . most of them have child who dependent of them . they have to povide stability inside there famillies ; financial and psychological . old poeple calculate more there step , they can not take risk because any false step can have bad consequence on them and there dependent . we do not have to forget the bilological factor in here also , old people can not have the same eager and the energy to explore and they are not vibrant a the young . but the last 2 paragraphes do not represent all the population . there are lot of young people who have big responsibilites because they can not depend on others for help , so they have to work to support themself and sometimes support there famillies . this category of youth do not enjoy it life a others . we have also old people who have financial security and stability , this category tend to enjoy life more . then a a conclusion this statement do n't have a simple yes or no answer . agreeing or desagreeing to it depends of personality of the person 's personality , his environement and his responsibility .
