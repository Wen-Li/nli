knowledge is a very powerful tool . the more you know about something , the better informed and prepared you are on the subject . if having knowledge in one area is good , it 's even better to know about many subject . having an integral education provides you with the base to be able to speak , even if at short length , about many topic . you are able to move throughout a wider social spectrum because you can relate to a larger group of people . that being said i think it 's important to specialize in one specific subject . experts have a very important place in our society . they are recognized by government , academia and many other place . their specialized information is valued because other people do n't know it . specializing in one specific subject lead you down a path of expertise . even better is when you can specialize in more than one subject . this way , you can combine different field and create new path of knowledge . specializing in a subject ( whether it be one or more ) also open a space to community . although a specific subject might not have a large range of people attached to it compared to people who have a broad knowledge , it is a more close and tightly knit group . there 's a development of tradition , rule and language that pertain to that specific group . take into consideration medical and legal jargon , which might sound like a foreign language to people who do n't have knowledge in that specific field . it is a way to communicate with people from the same `` tribe '' . people from similar field also are able to develop very strong relationship because they can understand the complexity of a particular subject . we can not overlook the importance of having an education that comprises of a wide variety of subject . this training enables you to be a constructive part of society . but since everyone ca n't be laying down block ( there 's also need of solder , sculptor , painter , etc. ) , there is also a need to specialize in a particular field so you can offer society the best part of yourself : your knowledge .
