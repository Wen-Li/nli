when i wa young , i used to go to a church and help older people who were living in my community . since i wa young , helping task were not that serious but i still remember that i had felt good and great whenever i helped them . however , a i grew older , i had to focus on studying high school subject such a math , history and chemistry to enter a prestigious university . naturally i could n't spend my `` important '' time to help my community . now i regret that much and think young people should give enough time to helping their community baecause of the following reason . first of all , we are able to feel how happy we are right now by helping our commnunities . there are a lot of way of helping community . among them , taking care of older people whose son or daughter do n't live near is an important task . they feel lonely and isolated so they need intersts of others and giving some intersts and help to them are not that hard . during giving them help , we could feel how happy situation we live in now and love our own parent more than before . in these day , young people do not give enough time to helping their community because they have lot of thing to do . however , consider wisely and just invest a little time to helping the community and feel great on our . life .
