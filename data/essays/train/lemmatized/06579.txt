i sadly have to agree somehow to the statement and say that it is true . most people my age prefer to do senseless thing in order to get engaged in their community . one could say , it is a kind of responsibility and duty we all have for our community . instead of helping at some festival or meeting with old people , thez hang around at some place smoking cigarette or even take drug , they play computer all day long without noticing that it ha become spring or sit in front of the tv watching how a mutant hog shoot down a man in order to get the power over the earth . this is not reality . on the other hand , even if it is true , i would not have given a better example . the youth nowadays ha to much to do with herself . there are friend they need to talk to , movie they have not seen yet , magazine they need to buy , besides other unrelevant trash they have to spend their money for . there simply is to much to do for them and no time left . another problem are their parent . there is nothing thez would more prefer than seeing their kid in an organisation that help the community . even if could be fun , no young person would bz himself participate in such an organisation , because it is what his parent would like him to do . somehow , the youth always want to rebell . rebell against the parent , the commercial , the government , the law . the youth is contra , what is left pro and vise versa . i know that because i have been such a kid . against everything . but soon i found out that there is more than what the tv show , what the friend say . i suddenly realised that it is a wonderfull feeling to help , to engage yourself or just to be around . i found out how much there wa to see in my own town and community , and if i would prove myself active , what could be made better . at least i would like to give an opportunity of a solution . if they themselves offer the youth some activity interesting for them , like party organized for the youth in some place in the city , they even could earn some extra money and have their youth involve
