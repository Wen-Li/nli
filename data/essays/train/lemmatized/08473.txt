i agree with the assumption that successful people always try new thing and take more risk rather than doing what they already know . in effect , we notice that nowaday , people who are most successful in life are people who diversify their occupation . for them in order to stay competitive in the business word , one need to broader his businees field . hence they are always trying a new field of business no matter for them what the risk will be . in fact in this globalisation of the economy the better you broder your business the more you are likely to survive in th business world . for instance we can refer to successful coorporations that intervent in several diferent business field . these company by diversifying their business production are able to cut down the cost of producing good . therefore they can offer a very low price for the good they are selling . so taking risk become part of the company policy because that allow them to survive in the business market . in coclusion to remain successful in life , any persone or entity must try new thing and take more and more risk .
