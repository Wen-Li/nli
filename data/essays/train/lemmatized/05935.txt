there are different opinion about a common belief that young people enjoy their life more than older people do . the fact that there are world between young and old make it very difficult . i agree with this statement because older people in general do n't have the right attitude toward life anymore . one really good example why older people do n't enjoy life a much a young people is that you can feel and hear it from them almost every day . if you have old people living in your neighborhood who ha n't heard ore of them complaining about the way you parked your car or drove your bike . when you 're older you take life to serious most of the time and you do n't really laugh a much anymore . there are different reason for that . maybe you just ca n't adapt to the new more modern life or maybe you just do n't want to . while the youth play videogames , go out partying and listens to rock/pop music , old people do n't really do that a much because they either ca n't anymore or they feel that 's not their time and they had their fun when they were younger . another major impact that keep a lot of people away from having fun is that they have injury and just ca n't do the thing a 20 year old can . you often hear older people sayin that they wish they would be young again because they know that you can enjoy life much more when you 're younger . i 'm sure many older people want to go out again and dance or do sport without having to be worried that they are going to break every bone . often just the look on an old man 's face tell u how he feel and that he 's not enjoying the position he 's in . there are many worn out old people where you can see that they had a life with lot 's of worry . does n't also everybody freak out evreytime they see the first gray hair on their head . people do n't want to get old they want to enjoy life . altogether it is a difficult topic with many different opinion . old people though just ca n't have a much fun a younger people do . younger people enjoy their life more a you can see if you compare them to old people .
