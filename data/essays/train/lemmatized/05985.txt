in twenty year it will be fewer car in use than there are today . i think that petroleum is becoming more and more expensive and that in twenty year it wont be enought for the rest of ther global population . so i 'm sure that it will be le oil or petroleum car in use but i 'm sur that people and humanity will find a way to commercialise alternative energy and we will be able to use it for our car . by the way , it 's already possible in brazilia where petroleum is being fired by a new kind of oil , the sugar alcohol . this new generation of car 's oil is well known in south america country a sugar is one of the most famous good of the country . but it 's not a reason , the world population is use to car m they are in our way of life since a hundred year and even if it work with a different kind of energy , people wont like to drive something else than car because they are used to it . there is no reason should be erased , our world live with it for so long that if we change it we will lost a part of our history . it 's whatever important not to dream on the situation , huge lobby in the united state and in orient are not enjoyed in those new technology and they will make presure on the gouvernement for it not allowed those new possibility to their country . for example in france it 's totally forbiden to ride a car that doe n't work with petroleum or gaz whereas there is already a lot of new type of energy like betrave or hydrogene that should be comercialised but cant because of the oposition of the state . however we will use some other energy than petroleum but in the next twenty year it seems pretty hard to imagine that the world will stop running after petroleum and will be cultivated differents kind of plant in order to go working or to be able to leave for holiday . so in order to conclude i think we can say that whatever what happens , it will still be a much car in twenty year but the real question will be to guess how it will work .
