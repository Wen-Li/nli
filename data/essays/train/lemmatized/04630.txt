i do not agree at all with the fact that is more important for student to understand concept rather then learning fact . therefore my opinion is that both those goal are needed to be accomplished from a student during his or her studying period , this could be hight school or university . preciselly it is even more important at university because , in this period of his life , the student is suposes to learn a job . for instance i studied political science in italy , at la sapienza university , witch is considered one of the best universyties in my country . while i wa learning all the subject of my course i realized that they where perfect and complete in the teoretical area but they lacked in the practical area . for example in the law course whe studied all the article of our civil code , and the professor wa very strict during the exam . on the other hand nobody of the student had the chance to looked to an example of contract . obviously this is a really important part of the course , in fact a friend of mine who studied with me , had enourmous difficulty on working after graduating . she went working in a very famous law farm , and she had to work four month not beeing payed because she did n't know how to write a contract . althought i had another fantastic experience that confirm my opinion . a couple of year ago i went studying at the international center of photography in new york city . eventhought i wa a little afraid of studying with a different system i found it much easier and much more challengin at the same time , even if it seem a contradiction it is not ! in this school i learned a lot about the theory of photography , like tecniques and history of photography . yet i practiced even more . i shoot with lot of different kind of camera , the view camera , a digital camera and the olga . for all these reason i think learning fact and how to practice them in the real life is very important for all student .
