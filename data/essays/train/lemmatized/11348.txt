i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . it is the stage i think , is more comfortable to enjoy our living . i feel so because it is practically noticed that young one 's have lot of zeal in them which make them more active . the young people work hard for heir future and at time never let their enjoyment go down . for example consider a student who plan to pas in distinction in the annual examination . for achiving this the student work hard the whole year , apart from this the student doe n't miss any other activity that involve enjoyment . young stage is the only stage where we can do anything a we can , no matter wheather it is right or wrong . it is the period where thing which cant be done when we become older can be done without any hesitation . they do what ever they want to do so that they can enjoy up to the maximum . for example they can dance , swim , play with the friend , roam here and there , can eat all the stuff which they want to , go for racing , can go for a challenge , involve themselves in entertaining program etc . on the other part they can enjoy doing what ever their interest is in . like in research field , software , where they can makeup their mind set accordingly . last but not the least i deal with the fact that everyone know that the young stage is the most preferable stage where everyone find it interesting when compared to other stage in our life . lastly i conclude saying that the young people enjoy life more than older do .
