i agree that successful people try new thing more important . i think someone who have desire about success are not satisfied one thing . they seek another thing , that is more attractive thing . successful people have an endless energy about doing something . so , they do not like a safety position . they think that staying in a comfortable situation is dead , which make them study many thing . for example , scientist discover many thing . even though they earned much money from one project , they do not enyoy the money . they get courage about doing something and proceed forward . they find new thing every day . i think someone who have power about thing are received from god . they are borned with the nature . i like edison because he ha not been edcated , but he did not stop studying something . as a result , he became the father of science . he invented many important , realistic , and useful thing . in spite of his successing , he invented another thing continuously . in my opinion , sucessful people like better a risk , adveventurous thing , . that is , thers is no satisfy . so they work for new thing .
