i disagree with the statement , because i still can see the young people helping their community whenever they have time . it is very common that young people nowadays having hard time doing thier task , such a , for thier job , school an so on . however , some of the young people , whenever they fave thier free time , they prefer to help thier community , for exemples , teaching thier own language to youngers and help to build and paint a house . these young people gather up and help old people to build their house and paint their wall . although they are already tired by thier weekday ' schedule , they attend on thier helping day and give hope to the old people . in south korea , there are many community that young people are involved . since they are meant to be `` the international '' , they go to the country which they would like to help and work there a long a they want . especially , they would like to go to the developing country and stay there about a month . since my uncle wa one of the person who helped his community , i heard that he help the community to plan for the trip to ghanna and so on . i think there are also some young people who do not put enough time to help thier community . however , it is wrong to say most of them are not helping because there are also many young people who are working hard for their community and whenever they have time , they always think about how they will make their community better . as the world get better in development young people will be more busy than they were before but on the other hand , i am sure that there will be also many young people who are willing to help their community whenever they have spare time .
