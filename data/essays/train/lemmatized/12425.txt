some student put a higher value in understanding the idea and their concept , rather than understanding the fact . the fact that i graduated with a major in international business , ha exposed me to different element , all taken in account when questioning myself , which of the both statement i agree with . however , both can have equal advantage that are quite different in many aspect . as far a i am concerned , understanding a subject 's idea and concept is more critical than studying the fact . for instance , the overall idea will stay in a student 's mind for a much longer period , sometimes even for ever . furthermore , these idea and concept can be re-used in the future in various situation . for instance , those i had learned in my business class helped me to open my own company a few year later . however , putting higher importance in studying the subject 's idea and concept only , can have equal disadvantageous element . understanding the fact can be dramatically important , depending on the chosen subject and career field especially . for instance , a history student is likely to study the fact and date of a historical event because it required . if the fact are used on a regular basis , the student might be able to remember some of them for an eternal period of time . in conclusion , learning about a theme 's idea and concept wa very beneficial for me with regard to my major . however , each student should be able to make an own decision , when questioning himself what is more essential for his study . furthermore the student 's chosen career play an important role , when answering this question .
