today it look like more and more people try to stay young . but why is staying young so attractive for many people ? do young people have more fun ? in our day it seems to be a trend to stay young . the medium support this thinking a lot by it comercial . many people today are influenced by tv and radio and follow this trend to stay young . to look a good a all the people on tv , many people bye product that are represented by the medium . they by cream or go to the gym in order to look better . following the medium that much is a big problem today because many people think that by staying young they are more attractive to other people . in addition , many people think that they can have more fun if they stay young . in my oppinion this is a big mistake . young people do not have more fun than older people . having fun depends on a person itself . people can have fun in every stage of their life . it just depends on themselves and what they do . there are many adolescence who do not have a lot of fun because this stage of life can be a very difficult one fore many young people . it is the time where the body change a lot . young people have to deal with this changement . during this period of time many young people have problem with their friend and family . this underline that being young is not allways the best time for everybody . in conclusion we can not generalize when people have the most fun of their live . that depends on the people themselves and what kind of life they lead . fore some people the statement `` young poeple enjoy life mire than older people do '' is truth and for other people it is wrong . it is important that people do not try to follow the medium a much . because looking younger doe not make anybody more happy .
