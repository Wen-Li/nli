i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . a i said i do n't agree because i am also a young people and i also do n't spend that much time on my community . i think that it is because we , young people do not have enpough time to spend their time on there community because of their homework . they ha too much homework , so they can not really concentrate what they need to do for themselves , they always get messed up in middle of their homework , they always start cry . also another reason that i think is that they always spend their time to play their video game . they always thiink about finishing the game ina year or some what like that . and also the bad thing about the video game is that their eye will get bad . a they do not limite how much time you can play video game a day , your eye will burn some day . ( which mean that you wo n't be able to see anything with out the horrile glass . ) the horrible thing about getting your eye getting burned is thetyou wo n't be able to see anything without your glass . as you wake up on the morning and open your eye you will always start off the day with the blurry world . and the world will change for ever . sometimes when my mother tell me that one of her friend that got a burnt eye took a surgry and got his/her normal eye back my mom 's friend said `` i never knew that the world wa this beatiful '' a she wa amaze her eye again became burt again . so even though you take a surgery of your eye it wo n't be any good . so these were the reasoning that why i agreed with young people now adays do not give enough time to helping their community . and my own opinion is that myself also do n't give enough time helping my community myself .
