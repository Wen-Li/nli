as video game and other modern activity become more and more common , some people think that there is a movement towards a behavior which includes to help their community le and therefore spending more time in front of computer . i do n't agree with the statement out of different reason . schools and other institution recently established some project which are to involve student in social activity . for example , my school started a project called social internship . every student had to work in a social institution for two week where he or she had to support ill or homeless people . these project strenghten the social skill of the student and i can tell out of my own experience that they initiate a special awareness to help other people in some situation . furthermore , there are many group of volunteer who support the community . these group help in various way . first , there are some group focussing on enviromental problem which collect garbage from wood and build some house for bird . second , there are group of student which take care of old people . they help them with the daily life , e.g. shopping , and spend their leisure time with reading book out to elderly people who are n't able to read them by themselves anymore . third , there are also some political motivated group . apart from that , there were made several survey which proved that most of the young people today are willing to help . it doe n't have to be a big support , because i think it is better if many people do little improvement than if a few want to change the whole world . people who claim that young people do n't help the community in these day should perhaps have a closer look on how teenager and young adult spend their leisure time instead of to believe preconception .
