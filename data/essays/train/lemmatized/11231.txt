in my opinion , i think it is more important for student to understand idea and concept rather than to learn fact . i agree that it is important to learn fact , but if a student end only learning fact without understanding the idea or concept this will be a mess . firstly , i agree completely with the statement because since i wa a child i wa educated : first to understand the idea and concept and after learning the fact . however , although it is important to learn some key fact it is not a important a it is to learn the meaning or understand the idea . secondly , i also agree with the statement because it reminds me while i wa studying medicine and a classmate of mine learned with his father how to make a `` heart operation '' but without even knowing the risk involved in the operation . imagine how dangerous could be for a person to be operated by a student who doe n't understand what he is doing . it would be better if he study , understand the concept/idea and after that he learn how to do it . by contrast , it is also true that some person start learning the fact and after that they manage to understand the idea and the concept . but this is not the common way , neither the best nor the ideal . i also agree with the statement because it is prooved that this is the correct way how to proceed . if they want to know and learn the fact they need first to understand the idea and concept . to conclude , if i wa a teacher and i am in front of the following statement or with the doubt of how to teach to my student , i would make them first to understand the idea and concept and afterwards to learn the fact .
