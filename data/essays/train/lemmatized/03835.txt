i strongly think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . there are three major reason for this . first , just imagine if you were an economist , and you have very specialized knowledge about economy . just ask yourself waht consist the economics . in fact , the subject `` economics '' consists of many other academicsubject like world history , mathmatics , psycology , and so on . it could be said to another subject s too . no academic subject can exist itself alone . so , if you study hard , it naturally lead to the fact that you hae broad knowledge of many academic subject . second , when you have conversation with other people , which kind of people do you think is more fun to be with ? the person who talk about just one topic again and again , or the person who ha various knowledge about various subject . i think the answer is simple . it could be said that the person who ha broad knowledge of many academic subject ha better ability of communication with others , and the ability of communicaiton is really important point to live this world . to be succesful in any field of society , it an essencial element . third , to have various knowledge can improve the quality of your life . when you travel italy , and you are familiar to the history of ancient rome , you could spend more excitingtime . if you can calcurate quickly and efficiently , it would be really convenient in everyday life . thus , various knowledge can be your tresure . in conclusion , some people say that by specializing in one specific , we can get deeper knowledge . i think it true . however , doe everyone need deep knowledge ? i dont think so .
