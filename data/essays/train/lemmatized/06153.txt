many people say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i agree with them beacause of the fllowoing reason . may be because they love the playing more than the work and that is real . other reason i think because they are le intelligent than the old people so they do not know enough about the correct thing . first , young people like the playing so much . i think all the people like the playing so much but not a the young people . also i think that most of the young people have a school so they have to study more than the adult . so their free time will be very little and if they spend it at working i think they will get tired . in addation , their body are weaker than the adult so they can not do the same job just like the adult . next , i think the young people do not think about their community because it is over their thinking . they have a limited brain . also they have a lot of fun which can make them busy . to sum it up , i think that the young people can not service the community a the adult . because of they like the playing so much . also they have a lot of fun and homework which can make them busy to work like the adult .
