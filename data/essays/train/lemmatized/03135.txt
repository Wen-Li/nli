nowadays young people have many different kind to happiness and they are n't the problem that their parent had . in my personal opinion is not true that the young people do not give enough time to helping their community . i disagrre to this statement . further , i want to say that the young people have a responsability and the possibility to study , then they became adult leater . then , they are few time for helping their comunities . i realy true that many no profit organizationes ( onlus ) can doing their activites because many young people work free for their . at this day , for a young person , is very difficult chosing to going in africa , or in another pure zone of the world , for helping the population . but a lot of young people do it . also many organization of city , for exemple churc or cri , have help by the young peolpe . another point that i think is it important to mention is that in a world full of elettronic intrateniment , money and when the possibility to travel and enjoy yourshelf are more it is very difficult filling the need to help the comunities . in my personal own opionion for improving the number of the young people that decided to helping their comunities is more important educating and teaching to child the importance of frendly , carity and love .
