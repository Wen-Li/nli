in my opinion , i agree with this statement because if you have a broad knowledge of many academic subject you are expected to work in many sector if we take the view from a working aspect . you are also able to turn into another sector for any reason with out the need of a long and costly formation about your new work . from another aspect , i think that a person with a global knowledge is more interesting than a person how only ha knowledge about a specific subject . in fact , with a person who ha a global knowledge you can talk about everything and you are sure to learn something and that is person will have a point of view about everything . in the other hand , the other person would be more boring and not so interesting becquse she only know a specific subject so after at while talking about this subject , you will feel a bite boring . but having knoweldge about a very specific subject can also be very positive . indeed , in the business sector , we can see that industry that are specialized in only one sector are usually more efficiant than others campany which try to extend theirselves to several market with product that are complitly differents between them . indeed , the specialized company know very well their product and also every thing that it is around the productt : production , custumers , market , competition . .. so they are very good in what they do whereas a company who extend too much will be in the end good in nothing . as a conclusion i think that you must always find a balance between beeing general and specific in every t
