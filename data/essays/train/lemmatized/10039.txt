advertisement ha got a great influence on society today . everywhere you can read : `` buy our product a it is better than the other one . '' companies try to make the people buy their product to gain more and more money . as far a i am concerned , i think , most of the product which are advertised for are not a good a the advertisement promised they are . first of all you have to ask yourself why the company advertise thier product . the answer is not really difficult . the only thing a company care about is how much money the owner or the management of this company will receive at the end . but for being able to sell a product they have to made this product popular and well-known in the population . they have to build up certain image of this product which ha to be rather positive . otherwise they would fail to achive their aim of higher and higher wage . to achieve these aim they have to opt for advertising their product in a positive way and it doe not matter how good the quality of a product really is . the opel company serf a a good example here . the opel company always advertised it automobile a being the best car among the others and that you will never get problem with this car . but this wa only a trick to make more people to buy their car . so there are more and more product which ha got a quite good advertisement but in real only a poor quality . in the end company acting in this way cheat on the person who buy these product . however , i think there are some possiblities to take an advantage of this situation of decreasing honesty in advertisement . companies which do not try to cheat on customer and submit that their product just have the ability and qualitiy it really ha the customer will thank the company for it honest advertisement and eventuelly buy more of the company 's product . but now both , company and customer have got advantage of this solution .
