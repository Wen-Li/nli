i agree with this statement because of several reason . my experience and observation made me think that way . there is a large number of advertisement surrounding our daily life including tv commercial , poster , billboard , and so on . however , there are not many advertisement showing what they acually are in my opinion . for example , one time i purchased a mascara at a drug store , because i wa attracted by it poster portraying a beautiful lady with a long mascara . nevertheless , i wa very disappointed by it 's result . there wa no difference between other product . as my example , i am very sure that there are many people who have experienced same . most of advertisement are usually over exaggerated because they need to sell their product . in order to sell their product , they have to attract their target audience . it is not easy thing to do . actually the cost for advertise product is oftenly more expensive than cost for making a product . it is very obvious that company want to make their product look good or even better than they really are . moreover , many company compete with other company in the same industry . due to high industry competition , company even more encouraged to promote their product in extreme way . it is their job . in conclusion , because of there reason i agree with the statement that most advertisement look much better that they really are .
