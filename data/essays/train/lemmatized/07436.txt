young people are the fundamental building block of any community . they are it foundation , whether it be culturally , politically or even socially . i believe that young people contribute precious time to helping their community a they are well sensitised to the problem that it face . the youth of any country is an essential ingredient in the larger matrix of a well-knit community . young people , through various medium and other forum , like television , the internet , are exposed to the grond reality in their community . education also informs them about the problem plaguing their community , and mode and method of resolving these problem . for example , by the constructive use of demonstration and petition , student in india have been at the vanguard of a silent yet sturdy movement seeking to transform the current status quo of lethargy and sloth in politics into one of efficiency and nimbleness . with the advent of the internet , the young people have found an articulate mouthpiece . they are frequently expressing their opinion through blog and what have you may . owing to their adaptive and dynamic nature , the youth ha it finger firmly on the community 's pulse . with the rapid pace with which the different form of communication emerge , the youth are sure to become major shareholder in the future from being mere stakeholder a of now . however , such fervour on part of the youth should be guided by experienced and responsible member of the community . at time , unregulated action by the youth ha led to catastrophies . for example , during the cutlural revolution in china , the red guards , a the youth wa referred to , at the behest of chairman mao zedong , without any inkling a to how to improve their society , lead to the killing and slaughter of intellectual , the very intellectual who were agent of change in the community . in conclusion , the youth ha done it fair share of community service . in fact , they have been welcome agent of change amidst a sea of senility and inaction by previous generation . the role essayed by them will only increase in size and stature a time progress .
