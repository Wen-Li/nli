it is a fact that nowadays young people do not give a lot of time to helping their community . but this is because the do n't have enough time to spend in that way . school and university take al lot of time during the day and they are seen like something that people have to do . for this reason young people usually spend the remaining time growing their hobby , playing with friend or going out to relax . the only way to make them give a contribute to the community should be to convince them that this can be funny and relaxing at the same time . in the past all the organization which envolved young people to community event were often related with the church , so today 's indifference to community problem or activity is maybe a reflection of today 's lack of influence of church in our life . there are many association ( not related with the chirch ) that try to envolve young people organizing workamps in their city and giving them a place to live and a job a volunteer in a specific field like ecological or social . working together with other young people and living with them for a while can transform a boring experience in a funny one and convince more guy to join to the same project . this is the reason why this kind of associacion like the sci ( civil service international ) are getting bigger and bigger and the number of young people joining is increasing . television and videogames are probably making young people forget the community and create an individual life-style , and i agree with this , but i think that this situation can change by the action of these kind of organization that join the useful work of a volunteer to the funny experience which a young guy need .
