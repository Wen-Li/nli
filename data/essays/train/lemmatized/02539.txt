yes , i agree to the statement that is given above . there are many reason and example , i would like to cite in support of my opinion . in everyones life , idea and concept are very important to learn the subject . concepts help them to understand and know the subject how it is developed . ideas help them to get logical reasoning on the subject . for example , in consideration of my life , firstly `` i will give importance to undersatnd idea and concept rather than to learn fact '' . the reason are concept are key role and important to get the sunject well and good , without concept there is no subject , if we know the concept of the subject we can go any where to it advanced level . in this way concept play key to the subject . secondly `` ideas also help in understanding the subject . ingeneral , the subject is basically depends on the idea . the person is well recognised on the subject based on his thinking ability , logical reasoning , and creativity . ideas and creativity help the people to reach advanced level on the subject . not only on the subject , if we concentrate on concept and idea on any thing we can reach the acme stage on that specific thing . but in some case , for example `` to develop or to get advanced level or to add accessory of any product in the market it is compulsory to learn some fact about that previous product '' . it is secondary preference only , it is better to know because `` we can attain the best on the product '' . the reason are `` we can know the demand , publicity , value of the product in the market '' . so , to reach success in one life understanding idea and concept are very important . therefore , everyone should concentrate on those topic . however , beyond concept and idea it is also important to learn fact a i had given example . insum , i would like to reiterate my opinion that the statement is agreeable from the above reason and example .
