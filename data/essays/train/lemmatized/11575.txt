this statement implies a double response for me . indeed in my essay i will give several reason to show that i agree with this statement but there is also some reason which make me think that older people can enjoy life more than young people . when we are young we have le resonsability so we make thing without thinking of the consequence . for example , if we want to act dangerously , this is our own decision , we have not a family to protect . in this sense , young people enjoy life more because they have nobody to worry about . if they desire they can just have fun . we can also say that young people are more lead to do extraordinary thing such a leaving a family and going in a place they do not know , just because it is a new experience . indeed most of the time they do not plan what they will do , they do not spend hour thinking about the consequence . they just live the present moment . however what is also true is that old people can enjoy life too . indeed they do but in a different way . they are happy with very little . for instance listenning the bird sing or staying in their home with their grandchild . they have a greater maturity than the youngers one have . so they do know care about detail . they have lived a lot of thing and pain . they are able to see the world with a distance so they can see what is important or not . this enables them to enjoy life . as a conclusion what i want to say is that we can not really say if young people enjoy life more than older people do . i would say that it depends on the context of our life . it depends also on the experience we had throughout our life .
