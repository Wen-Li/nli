i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . people learn thing from thier own mistake , in order to be successful , we have to face new obstacle and overcome them rather than just doing what we know and not gaining anything . first of all , all advertising company create new product and see how we react to it even though they might loose some money for producing it . by knowing how human react , they can get better sense of how the product work for u . they might need to improve more on the product , or they are really helpful and we might need them . by creating the new product , they get idea of how it work for u . in addition , computer and all mechanical thing are part of our life . we need them in our everyday life . it needed lot of patience to create computer and telephone to make them really convenient . people tried new thing that work the best for u and computer are now big part of our society . humans can not live without them , it is a source of connecting this world into smaller place . lastly , martin luther king jr. fought for equall right , he believed that all men are created equall . we can now live safely and peacefully because of his action . his speech moved lot of people , gave opportunity for others to fight for their own right . he no longer exists but he is known for one of the successor in our life . it take lot of risk and courage to try new thing but that is how people learn thing , start to know importance of taking risk . for instance , learning foreign language will be challenging for sure but pain we experience will turn into courage and we learn to be more confident and successful . we each should try new thing and prepare for some risk in order to grow ourselves a a person .
