i wil agree that the best way to see place is by travelling in a group led by a tour guide . by doing so we can get a good company , a there are many people with u , we can see more place , and we can collect more infrormation about the place , and further more many people can get their living by doing the travelling guide job . i belive that there are mainly three reason why i agree travelling with a group led by a tour guide . the first reason is we can have a good company . this is because many people are travelling with u . we can have a good talk with them , and even more we can learn some thing new from them . and the second reason is we can see more place in the tour . we did not feel lonly by that . by visiting more place we can learn more informaton about them from the travel guide . he will say the history , and importance of that place . he will show u each and every place that ha importance . as a good example , when i and my friend visited kalahasti one of the most important place in indai , we dont know any thing about that palce , just we got few direction about the palce like where to stay and how to go to place . when we came to place with that direction , they are very confusing we cant understand any thing . so , we share our money and keep a guide to help u . he helped u very much by showing all the place and keep on telling their importance . even though we spend money , we enjoyed the tour very much . and the last reason why , i prefer the tour guide is , they make the living with the money , the tourist gave to them . their entire family is based on that money . this money will encouraging the people to do the job of travelling guide . for all these reason , i prefer travelling with a group , that wa led by a tour guide .
