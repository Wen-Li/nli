succesful poeple are poeple who do thing well . what is difficult is to know in advance if it is a good or a bad thing . but how can we manage to be a succesful person . you have to take risk . of course you have to be quiet sure of your action . but what is fare more inportant is to believe in yourself . for exemple if you are a good singer but that you do n't believe in yourself you can be sure that you will never become a famous star . of course taking always risk can be dangerous specially when you like it . for exemple somebody who like going to the casino may loose a lot of money , so in this case taking risk is n't a good thing . in fact you must find balance . to be successful mean also trying new thing . but new thing are not always good , you have to try before beeing sure it is a good idea . but in fact what is really inportant is to learn of your mistake . for exemple if you try to passe an exam but that you failled what is important is to learn of your mistake so it will not happend again . by using this way of thinking you will learn a lot of thing and than will be able to do them well . but to become somebody successful you have to take risk and try new thing because otherwise you will never learn how to do thing well
