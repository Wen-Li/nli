some people believe that it is important to have broad knowledge of many academic subject while other people believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject . in my opinion , having much broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one subject for two reason . having broad knowledge ha many advantage for people . it give people great experience in all field . by watching , listening and reading in all topic in life . for instance , when anyone is interested in politics . he may talk and argue with anybody in it . thus , it will let people have more conciousness about everything in their life . in addition , having general knowledge enables people to take right decision . because the are not going to hesitate according to their knowledge . having general knowledge in all field ha disadvantage . people are not specialized in one subject . so , they are know only have partial infomation from all the subject . people may lose important information about any subject they have knowledge in . besides , if people are going to use any of these academic subject they will not be able to use it in job . because they did not learn every single thing in this subject . in conclusion , having a lot of knowledege in all academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
