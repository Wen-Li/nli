i do agree with the statment that young people enjoy their life more than an older person . every individual in more efficient , strong and lively in the earlier span of life , so it quite obvious that anyone with a wish to enjoy , can really enjoy life at the maximum in his/her early age . also one main aspect is the responsibility and work load . these are the two important feature that an old individual ha truck load on him/her but a young personnel hardly carry such load . they are least with the responsibility and in turn have a handful time to put in something interesting and adventerous . other major reason for young to enjoy is that young age is considered to be the `` age of moulding '' , thus he try to learn more and more of the thing which in itself is an interesting affair because gaining anything new is always fun , even though at time it might be leading to the wrong side of the track , but here we are discussing about enjoying life , so anyone in this young age could easily deviate to a path which might be misleading but still enjoying while on the other hand , an old individual is prone to be afraid of going for something new a he ha a lot of responsibility on him and would have to think about it a hundred time before going for it , so he usually stick to the orthodox schedule which make make him further more reluctant for going for fun filled part . but everywhere it not that they dont have the oppourtunity to enjoy instead many-a-times they sacrifice their pleasure for their young one to enjoy a they also feel that they already have had enough and now it their young one ' turn to capitalize on the life . in the end , we can conclude that for many physical and mental reason old people enjoy considerably le than the young one .
