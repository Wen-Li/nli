successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i agree with the following statement . i think that trying new thing is good for the world and help u to do better and have a better life . people who know about one topic want to change what they know . for example the scientist already know a lot of thing about the deseases but they are still struggling to give u a better life and better chance to stay alive . the successful people are successful because they demonstrate a new thing for the life on earth . they want to know more because they want to improve the quality of life and also earn lot of money . we have computer since a long time but every time people work on it to improve it and make it easy for u to work . i think that the world is running and all the thing in this world have to run too . at the past we had the airplane but they are not like those for today . people make it faster and agreable for customer . they take risk because they believe in what they are doing . as a result they win the challenge and make a lot of money . by trying new thing they are learning new thing and they use those thing to create special machine . at the past we had a telephone which wa big and wa very uncomfortable . people worked to improve the quality of outgoing and incoming call and the size because they want to simplify our life . now we have a small telephone which is called cellphone . we do not need to stay at home to receive a call . with this new technology of wirelless and other i can have my with me and go out . i 'm able to have a call . those new thing became reality because people try new thing take risk . those people could not do research and today we will not have all this kind of machine . also they are trying new thing because they know that they could make money . i agree with the statement .
