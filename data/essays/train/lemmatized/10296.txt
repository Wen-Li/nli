there are conflicting view whether young people enjoy life more than older people do . it depends on the location the person life or the background situation the person underwent . nevertheless , in my opinion , yound people enjoy life more a they have not encounted much , thus everything will be novel and exciting for them , plus , they have healthy body that permit them to enjoy life and young people tend to be le stressed , thus enjoy life more . generally , the younger the person is , the le experience s/he had gone through . therefore , everything they do , it will be exicting for them a it would be a novel experience for them . to exemplify this idea , a young person who travel by air will be enthusiastic , a for them , plane travel could be something extraordinary and novel , contrary to an older person who ha already had abounding number of air travel . for that older person , it would be tiring and unenjoyable . more importantly , it is no exaggeration to say that the state of one 's health determines whether a person can enjoy life more than others . it is a known fact that the younger the person is , the healthier s/he is . to many , climbing the himalaya mountain could mean enjoying life , seeing the natural beauty of the planent . trekking for a month to climb the ever-lasting range of mountain until reaching the apex requires healthy body . thus in other word , the younger the person is , more it is possible to enjoy life . lastly , i am sure that many people will agree with me , a older we get , we tend to get more stressed out . when we are young , we only have to worry about school report or doing well at school . therefore we can freely enjoy life . go clubbing and dancing all night without any worry . however , older people have many thing to worry and care about . parents have to worry about money . enjoying life by going on a holiday , they worry if they can afford it or can they take a leave from work or more commonly , who will look after the child ? to conclude , young people tend to enjoy life a they have the health capacity to do so , the mind and the passion . they do n't get headache like older people about money or child . therefore , it is actually depressing to point out the fact that when people age and reach their retirement age , they can not enjoy life a much a young people can .
