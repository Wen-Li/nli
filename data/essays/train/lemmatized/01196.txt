well actually i can not say wheter i agree or disagree , because it depends on the situation . for example when i want to travel without my friend and my family i would propably choose a groupe led by a tour guide . because then you are not completely alone and you will see a lot of the country you are travelling to . but on the other side it is sometimes really annoying to be with a group of 20 people . you always have to wait till everybody is back in the bus and so you waste a lot of time waiting for people . and of course you are not a independent a you would be travelling alone . because the tour guide ha his programme to do . for example i have been to england with my mother in june and we did not want to drive by our own and so we decided to travel with a group . but sometimes we really missed to do the thing we want to do . because someday we were in this really nice village but we had just 30minutes there bevore the bus left again , but that wa just not enough time to enjoy this . especially not , when the place you visit after that is absolutly not compareable to this nice village . so normally when i travel with my parent we do not travel with a group , because it is more comfortable . and then my father always prepares very good so that he take the part of the guide and show u everything , although this is sometimes more exhausting than travelling in a group . because my father ha a really strict timetable for the thing he want to see and so we have to get up very early and come back to the hotel late in the afternoon . so in my opinion it depends on the situation . normally i would not choose travelling by a group , but when you travel alone it is the best way . for example i am now in australia and when my language course finished i also want to travel around , but i do not want to travel by my own , because i think it is comforting to now that you are not alone and will not get lost . so i really can not say wheter travelling by your own or travelling by group is better , because both kind of travelling have their advantage and disadvantage .
