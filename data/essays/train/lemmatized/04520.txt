i disagree with the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are several reason to explain my point . first of all , i believe that it is necessary for student to learn fact first , which will help them to grasp knowledge and make them get a sense of feeling of what they 've known about the world around them and help them to perceive their own idea . ontology and epistomology are the basic element for human being to understand the world and the reality . it is especially important for student to learn fact . secondly , i think it is equally important for student to understand idea and concept and learn fact . as idea and concept are coming from the fact that leart , they are correlated with each other . students can not fully grasp the idea or concept if they lack basic knowledge of fact , on the contrary , fact are meaningless if idea and concept could not be understood . for instance , the idea that hungry cat will more porbably catch moving objective like bird and mise than the one that are full could be fully understood only if student got an idea that cat prefer mise and bird a their food , which is the common sense . thirdly , understanding fact will better enable student to grasp idea and concept and help them to put the idea and concept into practice . take another example to illustrate this view , the fact that people will fail down easily on an icy road will help student better konw the idea that it should be careful to walk on an icy road , and the experiment that erosion will decrease the possiblity of failing down and spliting salt water will increase the melting time of ice will make people carry these concept out in reality so that the road will be much safer to walk on . in short , it is in a rush to say that understanding idea and concept is more important for student than for them to learn fact . from the analysis above , we may conclude that understanding idea and concept and learning fact are interacting with each other and hold the idea of they are equally important will help u better understand the reality and the world around u .
