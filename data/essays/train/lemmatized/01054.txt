by looking at the people around me and the society , i could see that young people tent to enjoy life more than older people do . i think it is true that the young people enjoy their life than most older people do a the young people think more positively than older people do and a the young people try to do everything in enjoyable way . first of all , young people have positive mind that they try to accept thing in good way even though they are not in a fondable situation . but in contrast , old people worry first and afraid to put in action before they start . in my opinion , this is because the young people believe that they still have a lot of year to live so that they always try to carry out experimental thing and try new thing . on the other hand , older people think that they do not have long life left . they always try to be care and think more before they carry out any thing . for example , when i and my father go to a restaurant , we often choose different meal . my father always choose the same menu that he had last time but i always choose different meal and sometimes try new one if the restaurant invented one . like this , older people do not like change their normal routine and get out of tract when young people like to change and try new more . secondly , young people tend to enjoy life more than older people do a the young people take thing easy and try to enjoy everything they do . i think it is true that young people seek out for something that is interesting and fun while older people find everything seems to be same . for example , i went to a market with my grandmother and when we got to there , my grandmother only went straight to the section where it ha thing that she ha to buy . however , when i entered , i walked around the most section and saw thing that are displayed and read note on it . like this , young people find interesting fact for themselves even from boring thing when the older people only look for what they want . overall , i agree on the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do a young people are always open-minded and make thing enjoyable for themselves in their way .
