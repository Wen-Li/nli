young people often in general have a bad image . they only want to make party , they make a lot of noise , they do not really care about their future and they do not invest any of their time to help their community . this is a opinion that is pretty widespread , especially under elderly people . but is that really true ? is our youth that much spoiled and destroyed ? i think there are also many situation which show exactly the opposite . especially in the united state , where volunteer work ha a very high meaning , many young people spend much of their free time helping community . they work with child , they work with elderly people or they engage in protecting the environment . in those state , volunteer work is highly admired and school would support it a lot . probably in european country like switzerland or germany , this is not really the case . volunteer work is not that commun and it might not be that often the case that young people engage in it . this can also be a result by the fact that school do not support it enough and do not make it popular enough . but very often , helping the community may also be acted out in a form , that is not that formal or public a it is when a individual doe volunteer work . for instance it might also be a helpful act of young people when they help an elder individual crossing the street . or when they show them how to use a ticket machine at a train station . so all the helpful act can also be acted out in daily life . for sure , such act are often done by young people , but that is not really recognized because it is not that public . assumed that young people in our day really do not help their community enough . what could be a reason for it ? it might be that young people are just under more pressure than they were in ancient time . the economy is not that stable at the moment , job are rather rare and one ha to work against a lot of competitor to find his job position . therefore a lot of effort ha to be put into working on the career and make sure that one find a good working place . it often can be the case that there is simply not enough time left to do some social work . and in our material western society , finance and a wealthy life are for most of the people more important than conducting a social life . based on all those fact . i agree that young people generally do not put so much effort into helping their community in a public form . for instance they do not help a lot in the church or in childcare or in environmental group . but probably they do a more hidden kind of helping their community simply by acting out some social act in their daily life .
