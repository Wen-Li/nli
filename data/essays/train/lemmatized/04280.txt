young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , personally i agree with this statement . why i agree with it ? nowaday yong people are not giving enough time to help their community and i have three reason how and why they do n't help it . first reason is that young people are interested to them study and them target is to get just like diplomat or master , something related to a high education , then they will have a large time to help them community on a good way for instance they will be able to help it by building mall clubes or develope the rail road ant highway . second resons is that young people do n't have them own money to help the community , they still young and ca n't have a part time job because we do n't have it in morocco . equally important is that the have only two free day whiche are week end , for this purpuse they need these day to have fun and break . finally when young people graduate from university the do n't find job opportunity so they ca n't give enough time to help their community because the need to help them self first then community . in my opinion
