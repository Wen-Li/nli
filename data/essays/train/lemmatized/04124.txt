from my point of view this statement is only partially true . through my study in the area of management and entrepreneureship i know that the typical successful entrepreneur is not the crazy person many people think . quite the opposite is actually the case . a successful entrepreneur think his idea and plan through very carefully before acting . even though it is of course true that there is always some risk involved , risk-taking should not be confused with carelessness . more over , i believe that a person who really know where his or her strength lay , can be very successful . for example , if a person ha a passion for and the ability to building guitar , it will probably be best to exploid and build on this ability , rather than try to build many different instrument . specialization is the kye here . so , if someone is good at something and like what he or she is doing , improving the skill in this area will be more successful that starting to experiment . this of course doe not mean that a person , who focus one his strength , can stop learning . it only mean that the energy for learning new way and method should be focused on that one particular area . for the guitar builder , for example , this would mean to every now and then try something new to improve his procedure . he could maybe invent a machine which help him to be more efficient . thereby he would be would try something new but the risk involved if the machine doe not work is limited . another way to try something new without carelessly taking risk is to transfer experience . a person who ha gained expertise in a particular area might find a new and different way to use this knowledge . using the same example , the guitar builder could for example begin a cooperation with a violine builder and exchange knowledge . the process involved are similar but neither of them would have to actually start building the other instrument but both could still profit from the experience . after all , i would rewrite the satement a follows : successful people try new thing but carefully estimate the risk involved .
