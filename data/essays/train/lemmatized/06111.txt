it is often said that these day young people do n't spend enough time to be concerned about their community . some people might agree with this statement because many young people become selfish because of the internet . however , i am strongly against the idea of youngster 's indifference about their community because they are insighting the homepage of community and help the lonely old people . to begin with , the young in modern society are interested in the way how the community behaves in the area . it is commonly observed that many young people post claiming writinga in the board of community . accordingly it is a myth that nowadays youngster care only about themselves . for example , june kim , one of my friend , ha one son , who is 8 year old . when he went to his son 's school , he realized that the lunch menu wa too bad for child to take . as soon a he came home , he began to write the the principal of the school about this , and the lunch menu ha been changed . in addition , many young people have accustomed to helping people . it is obvious that when many school give the student class score according to how often they help the poor people or weak people , student are willing to help people . consequently , many young people help people without hesitation due to the habit in the school . for example , my son is elementary student . i had never taught him to yield the seat to the old , but in a bus , when an old person got on the bus , my son quickly stand up and guide him or her to his seat . i wa really proud of my son . in brief , i firmly believe that the young already know how to participate in the community and how to help their community . thr
