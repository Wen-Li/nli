i agree with that statement because innovation , experimentation are part of the risk people need to take in order lo learn new thing . if we keep doing thing the old way is not room for improvement , knowledge , advance in technology just to name a few , and it will be no progress at all . in order to succed we need to keep looking for new alternative that allows u to grow fast enough a the rest of the sciencies , like for example when sir isaac newton created the ligth bulb wa after many attempt his mind wa hungry to discover new thing . if he did not take a risk and keep on trying we will be still using candle to illuminate our home . in the same way construction company they have to keep loking for better solution for all the housing problem , every day is a new and advance equipment in the market that will help them to provide to the population a safer , confortable , affortable and prettier look to the construction . not so far down , what about the medical advance we have now and all of that thanks to people that doe investigation even though sometimes they are expossed to several degree of pressure , but at the end everything is for our own good a a society , for the better future . no to mentioned poor people that were idealistics and started a bussines just based in hope and nowdays they are veryr succesful in wathever they decided to do like for in general term i believe that the person that doe not take risk is loosing somenthing whether is an opportunity to grow , to succed , to create , etc.in my country we have a popular saying that say that if you do not risk an egg you would not get a chicken !!!
