after baby is born he/she growes up in many developmental stage . if he/she adapted a new skill and knowledge in each stage he/she can develop the independency , self-esteem and maturity . in the same reason i strongly believe that people should try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . when people learn how to communicate with their close family member for their need they start to build up their independency . they are capable of being educated for the new thing such a how to talk , how to use toilet or how to socialize with others . they have to face everyday challenge and pick up the new skill and information to grow up . these experience give them independency to live their own in the future . as child grow up successfully in ecah stage of life they develope self-esteem which need to continue to respond to change . when they have strong self-esteem they will deal with the difficult situation better and more efficiently then who have lack of self-esteem . with all these successful experience in growing chileren became an adult with maturity . successful people remaine having this maturity in their life and practice it in different time specially challenging time . doing something famillier make u feel safe and secuer . but if people do not take risk to learn or creating something new there 's no development in human history .
