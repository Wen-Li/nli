enjoyment ha nothing to do with the age but ha lot more to do with heart , ability and more importantly with the condition that a person is in . and for that reason i think that even the older people get to enjoy their life maybe in different way but they do enjoy their life . young people get to enjoy on the dance floor or in the college cafetaria . similary the older generation get to enjoy and spend their time in their own thougful and entertaning way . one and easily see lot of older people in the park , enjoying walking , chit-chatting or enjoying various other activites their such a gardening , laughing club etc cetera . the park next to our society is one such living example . one can easily find lot of older people lottering either alone or in company of their friend or grandchildrens . again older people are free from most of the tension and duty such a money matter , family matter and thus lead more carefree life with ample amount of free time to spent a they please and in fullfilling their wish and inventing new hobby . for example their is an old couple staying next to my house who have taking clay modeling a their new hobbie . lot of others prefer either reading , writing , travelling or enjoy spending time in various social activites , at religious place or playing around with their grandchildrens . some people argue that older generation are weak and lack enough energy to enjoy life . yes old age do come with it own proplems such a health problem and low enery level but this is old time story . one can easily find out the number of older people enjoying and living their life to fullest . for example the prime minister of india , the president of united states of america along with lot of other national and internation example are openly challanging this view . for the above stated reason i feel that even older people get to enjoy their life maybe in their own way and not a the yong generation but their do enjoy their life ,
