a person is a student for all of his \ her life because learning process continues in all life . a learned issue can be forgotten in a long time period . the fact that if the person know the main idea of the topic he \ she would not forget it easily . so i agree with the statement that express understanding idea and concept are more important for student than it is for them to learn fact . i agree with the following statement because of several reason . firstly , when a student learns the idea or concept it is more stable because the main point are learned by understanding the idea . for example , in a math class a boy can forget about a formula . by using the prove method he could reach again the formula . so it show that he get the idea-which mean the prove method - and using the idea he reached the fact-the formula . secondly , without understanding the idea and concept it hard for a student to learn fact . it is a weak way of learning . actually it is named a memorizing . memorized information can not last long . but the information which a student learn is neccessary for his \ her education life . for example , a memory of historic information can be forgetten in a several dayes . but if a student get the idea with a small practice he \ she would not forget it easily . on the other hand understanding idea or concept is not enough sometimes . as an example you can know how to prove a formula but if you dont know the formula then your idea learning mean nothing . as an conclusion understanding idea or concept is more important for student than learning fact . the learned information can be forgetten but the understood information will last longer / .
