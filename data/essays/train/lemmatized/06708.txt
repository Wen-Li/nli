i think that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is necessary , it is the first step of a good education , a good foundation giving the best chance to adapt . but then it is often required to get a specialization . in our society being specialized in one specific subject is more and more a necessity , vital to get a job or to hold a position in a company . also it help to have a better salary . it will often depend on the type of work or position . for example , lawyer should have broad knowledge of the legal system , the main legal principle and case . but during their training , they are required to choose a specialization . corporate lawyer should have a good practice and experience in company law . they can not practice in public law and be good at it at the same time . these subject are too different . the more they can get an experience in a specific area of law , the best they will be in their area , the more they will be competent , recognised and well-paid . the issue is the same for people working in research or in the medical sector . after a certain number of year of study , a specialization is often mandatory for a certain number of job . but the above mentioned statement can be exact for manager for example who should have a good knowledge of many area of their company in order to be able to take the right and appropriate decision
