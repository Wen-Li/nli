yes i agree with this statement . i think that young people have so much time to spend how they want . tipically young people do not work and they can do more thing than older people . they can dedicate time to their hobby , meetting some friend , going for a walk , playing a game or going to the the cinema . young people have no specific time that can constrain their action . unlike , older people have it . a yuong guy can go out in the evening with his friend , going into a pub , coming back late in the night and if he doesn ` t want , the next day he can stay at home instead to go to work a older people do . older people , anyway , can have some advandages . the most important is that they have a lot of money that younger people don ` t have . with that money they can buy what they want , a : car , computer , vacation and traveler in general , house and etc . .. all thing that can improve their life . older people have a lot of responsabilities that young people don ' t have . they have maybe a marrige to maitain some child to grow up . young people in contrast have more indipendence but is true that at least they have to respect the order of the their parent . in conclusion i confirm my opinion ( that is the same of the task question ) : young people enjoy life more than older people do .
