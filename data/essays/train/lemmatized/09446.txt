in my university , beside our specialization there are different subject we must take in order to graduate . for any freshman student , ofcourse he/she will complain about these non-related subject . but , when they finish their study they will realize the reason why our university ha done it , like i did . i agree with the statement saying that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' for several reason . first of all , having a wide knowledge of many academic subject would give one the power of faceing any problem in the society later when one garduate or even before . secondly , that knowledge would give one a greate apprortunity to find the job he/she would like to be in not nessary linked to the academic specialization . a computer engineering student , for example , attending different class in designing and programming would give him/her better chance in finding a job than if he/she did not attend these class . almost all job manager are looking for people with many different skill in different aspect of the life than an excellent computer engineer who doe not know how to deal with customer or collegues . most importent reason , is that attending different class with different people in each class mean that one will get to meet many people in his acadmic life . this well help every student to gain more experience for future work life . learn how to deal with others is a very important skill , because all job are baised mainlly on dealing with the manager , dealing with teammate if one is working in team project and so on . in conclusion , i think all student should have wide knowledge of many academic subject than sticking to only one subject even if they are not required to take different subject because it will help them a lot in their future life .
