i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . it is hard to agree with one or the other . but there are several reason that drawn me into this conclusion . first , having a lot of knowledge of many academic subject will give you different view of thing . i believe that it will help you grow a a person . when you encounter a problem , if you know that there are more then one side on everything in this world and be able to try to look at the problem from other side , it will be easier for you to get through the problem . however , if you are into just one thing , even though you know a lot about it , because all you have learned in your life is your specialization , you will have hard time passing through those problem . second , it might seem great to specializing in one specific subject , but there always are greater people above you . and more you are into the subject , more you suffer from not being the best . this argument fails unless you are not the best . but how many best are there ? yes , one . there are more chance for you to be the non-best . third , let me put this whole quesion into the real world . if you are specialized in one subject . you might get paid well . you might get a good spot at work . but you are not a hero at home . you are just a person , who brings a lot of money to your house . however , if you have broad knowledge of many academic subject , people that matter , your family will appreciate you being able to answer question about a lot of thing . i would rather be a hero at home with my family i care about then a hero at work to have a happy life . the opinion you come up with on this subject ha a lot to do with what kind of person you are . i am a kind of person , who value my friend and family . it is important to for me to stay heppy and not depressed . it could be a waste of life for some people . but to me , having good time mean living the life the fullest . i do not want to live my life suffering . that is why i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
