the statement claim that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i disagree with the claim that young people do not spend enough time to help their community . some of the reason for my opinion is stated below . first , these day we see that are lot of charity organisation which are being taken up and run by young people . let u take an example of an organization called banyan , which is very popular organization in south india . the organization mainly aim at helping people with mental disabilties . this organization give them love and support and also educates people about certain disablities like alzheimer 's disease , etc . this organiztion wa formed by three young girl in their mid-twenties who realized that these people need the support and love of a family . there are many such example of organizantions coming up all across the world all run by young people . these day youngster because of greater access to information and also a the overall standard of living of young people in the world is increasing , they want to give something back to the society that helped them grow up . there are young doctor who are ready to go to the remotest part of the world and treat people , there are youngster starting rallying and procession to fight for the various problem faced by the community of the world . young people these day are aware of the situation in many part of the world where poeple do n't get the basic neccesities of life . they want to work towards a society which is truly free and doe not discriminate a person based on his color or the language he speaks or the place he come from . let u take the 30 's and the 40 's , most of the youngster then were at war front fighting for their country . fighting for country doe not exactly translate to working for the betterment of your community . you fight for your country to ensure her freedom . these decade , were the time when almost the entire younger generation of the world wa engaged in the world war , and could not spend time explicitly helping the community . following the war came the cold war and the arm race , during this period the youth of the world were wary that a war might start and were busy protesting against it or preparing for it . following the end of the cold war , started atime when young people start making many great achievement in different field and they all wanted give something back to the community . let u take the example of chris martin , the lead singer of a band called coldplay . the album he and his band have made have sold in million acroos the world , however he spends major part of his income in the fight against aids and he also to charity show to raise money to eradicate poverty in the third world country . thus in term of money , time or effort young people these day are actively taking part or they are starting their own effort to help the community across the globe .
