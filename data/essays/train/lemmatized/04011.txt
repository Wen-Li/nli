people say that we prefer to learn fact in the our life . some people also say that learning something without understanding idea and concept of the material are dangerous in the their field . in my opinion , i think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact at first , when i wa high school , i had to experience to learn my science subject without understanding concept coming my test . as the result , i wa not taken score that i wanted because i had to memorised the subject on purpose such like another student studing their test . however my friend named mathuda had to study his subject in keeping understand the test . in addition if he wa not understand any more about science , he tried to struggle to understand the science of the concept . so he won the prize of test . understanding the concept contributies student to konw in the field more detail . it offer our to have imaginage in our life . it mean more effective than learn fact because we need to develop strong skill of our subject in our life . having understand idea is to establishes to expand our field more . in this manner . i prefer to study understanding idea and concept . in conclusion , i agree with above statement .
