cars are the most used form of transport knowadays will that change in twenty year ? it is very hard to answer . on developed country nearlly everyone above a certain age ha a car , alot of people use it on a daily basis : to go to work , shopping , travelling and on the leisure time . i use the car everyday and i can not imagine life with out it and because of that i think that there will be more car rather than fewer in twenty year . you can argue that : petrol is running out ! . everyone know that , everyone is aware yet not many know what is going to happen with it price . in twenty year i beleive that price are going to increase , le people are going to be able to pay that price , people on shorter income will have to use other way to move around and therefore the number of car would be expected to decrease because people wont be able to pay the price but the problem is that there are other fuel that can be used and people will get used to having car which are slower and le pawerfull . i also beleive that developing country , future super power like china , are going to demand huge number of car a the citizen get richer . they will want to have the freedom to travel around just like european and american do know . can you imagine how many more car that would be ? i think that not only there will not be fewers car in use but there is going to be more and more , i have no idea how we are goin to manage with the number of car but im sure that human being will find a way to cope with it because a long a people want to use car they will use them .
