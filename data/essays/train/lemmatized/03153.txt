i agree with this statement . the reason behind this is that a time progress city and population are growing larger . as the population growth is happening city are becoming far more over crowded then before . this already causes many traffic issue and road problem because of such a large number of car on the streat . with the increasing population their is no way for this problem to be solved except for reducing the amount of car on the streats . evidence of this ha already started a cheap public transportation is starting to rise . for example the mass transport system in london , they have the underground , and the bus , which eliminate the need for many people to own , ride , or drive in a car . thousands of people are able to move around without having the need to use a car . the mass transport system alone ha taken care of a bit of the problem that is being faced at the moment . even the city of dubai ha started taking measure to reduce the number of car on the street by begining the construction of the sky rail , which is to become the new mass transport there . global warming and polution is also an other reason why car should be lowerd in number . the prevention of polution and the slowing of global warming would be aided greatly by the reduction of car on the street . in the next twenty year many government around the world will most likely take measure , just a london ha , and dubai ha started , in order to reduce the amount of car that are being driven . this would be resolving two separately unrelated problem with one solution . th eproblem of over crowded street would be solved by the provision of effective mass transport system . and the global warming , polution issue that car create would be solved by this reduction a well . with those two global problem , measure will be taken to reduce the number of car on the street in the near future . so in twenty year it is very likely that their will be far le car on the street then their are during this time .
