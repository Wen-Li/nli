everyone in this life like to be a successful person , but it is not easy to be a successful . to be a successful person you should have many charicristic that it could help you . and i agree that the person who want to be successed he should be a risky perosn and should not be worried about some easy thing that could be solved . i agree with this for reason . firstly , if the person stood and wiaited for people to do every thing for him , he would not be a successful person . there are alot of people who are like that , i will give an example of many people that i can see them in my daily life . the example is that one of my best friend who want to be a successful medical doctor , he is eightteen year old and he ha only one promblem that is facing him and this problem is haveing a good grade in toefl to be accepet in the university , even this is his only problem , he is not working and practicing to have the wanted grade . the second reason that make me agree with this statement is the richest man in the world , the microsoft owner . he put an imposible goal that could be reached . he put a risky goal to work on it , 30 year ago the put . his goal wa to make every house in the world haveing a computer , and he successed in his goal . how did he success ? it wa not an easy goal , he start his dream with his friend by having a small company that make a computer softwear . he wa thinking what is the helpful computer programms that could the humanity to be better . and he could to reach his goal to have a computer in every house in the world , beacuse of it is great programms , like the internet explorer that make the conection between all the people in the world very easy and make them feeling that the world is a small village .
