usually student do n't really understand why idea and concept are tought in school or university rather than fact . which of these two notion is more important ? let 's weigh the pro and con in order to have a clear opinion on this subject . i usually ask myself `` what am i doing here ? '' while attending a math course . indeed like me most of the student i do n't really understand the point of learning math which is totally absract . it is always about number added to each others , multiplied , equation , solution ! i 'm not very keen on this subject but in this case i see no solution . for instance , we all know that becoming a brilliant architect or a great physician is impossible without acquiring math notion and knowledge , but how can this knowledge be useful when we do n't really understand how it can be applied on our everyday 's life ? in biology for example we learn how the human body is constructed , it anatomy , it strength and weakness . these scientifical fact are useful at any time ! by learning biology we are able to understand the reason of the consequence : how our brain command each and every move of our body . .. this example also applies to physic a this subject is tought by showing experimental work and displaying to the student the reason of all the phenomenon that happen on our planet for instance . newton 's falling apple lead him to discover gravity that lead to the explanation of other event . but in the end it is always about math ! these eplanations can only be proved by this important science and that 's the main reason why this subject must be tought , although it useless apperance which veiles one of the most important aspect of science . to put this in a nutshell , it appears that fact would n't exist whitout idea and concept a the proof of a general fact is impossible whitout demonstrating hypothesis by experiment and calculus . even if fact are closer to reality than concept , these two topic ca n't be taken apart , they depend on each other .
