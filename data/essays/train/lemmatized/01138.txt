i do not agree with this opinion because of these three reason ; expense to have a tour guide , not being able to communicate with local resident , and not being able to learn taking resposobilities and the real side of the place . first , it is expensive to have a tour guide compared to taking a trip on your own or in a group . it is not nessesary to worry about the cost if the person is rich , however not very many people would like to speand too much money just on traveling because it is also important to spend money on souveniours or on the food . therefore it is not nessesary to have a tour guide . second , it is hard to communicate with local resident with a tour guide . when taking a trip , it is a great opportunity to talk to the local resident because they may be able to tell you where good restaurant are or nice place where local people only know . also , when traveling a foreign country , it is fun using a foreign language . if you are traveling with a tour guide and he or she always doe thing for you , you might lose these opportunity . third , the tour with a tour gude in a group can be fun with no learning and responsibility . taking trip can be a learning place . you can learn about the people , culture , atomosphere , and the language where you visit . when you are with a tour guide , you will only listen to the tour guide and your friend in the group , therefore these learning opportunity decrease compared to taking trip without a tour guide . also you will be dependant on the tour gide so that you will not be able to learn a much a traveking alone . let 's travel alone ! you may be scared to travel alone , however there are so many thing you can learn by taking trip on your own . it is cheap to take trip without a tour guide and fun to get to know the local resident . you will also be able to learn many thing by traveling alone . again , i do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
