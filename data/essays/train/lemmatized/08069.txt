i agree with the opinion thjat young prople og today 's world are not that inclined towards community service a wa the scenario some decade ago . multifarious factor might have contributed in this gradual change of attitude . factors worth listing include social and political one . young people thesis day are more career oriented . the job of today 's hustling world consumes most of their time . little is the time they are left with . imagine an employee at some multinational company who ha to work day in and day out to survive his post . the stress and tension involved and the immense competition at his work place make it almost impossible to get some spare time for himself . and that spare time too ha to be divided judicially among family matter , recreation and the list will continue . still , there are people who , inspite of all these offset , try to contribute a much a they can for community service . but , this is for sure a limiting factor that discourages one to get involved with social service . another fact that might be propounded here , is that over the year there is a gradual chane in the thinking and psycholgical make-up of the society a a whole . for example , a young aspirant who wish to pay an equal importance to his work , his recreation , his community service , his family , might be let down by his peer who do n't think these ideal fit enough in the modern world . it can be alet down , however , it depends on one 's discretion only what to follow then . various organisation have come up all over the world that cater to need of society . it is true that it is difficult for these organisation to attract young people . rarely do they find individual who want to work selflessly expecting no exorbitant reward . the younger generation ha many alternative before it to consider for it livelihood in the developing world of today . the lack of lucre in this field might also be a factor discouraging the younger lot to enter in community service .
