technology is in a fast progress . since the invention of the television , people have been spending much more time in front of them . as a result , the researcher find out that advertising the product on tv or on billboard will catch so many people 's eye . but i , personally dont believe the general idea of the community . i dont think the better the product is advertised , the better it is . i want to share my experience . about a year or a year and a half ago , i bought a set of knife from a television ad , assuming that they are better than my regular knife . although , they were being advertised like even having the ability to cut a wood , it wa a total disappointment when i got them . they were not even different from my old knife , and supposed to do the same job . afterall , i began to use them in any case and after 6 month or so , they began to not to be trenchant and had to throw all of them away . they neither cut a piece of wood , nor a tomato at the end . my second experience is about believing or assuming the ad product were better wa about a doll for my cousin . she wanted the toy , that wa sold in a store , and also advertised on the tv . as a matter of fact i bought the toy to her and it had broken in few day , while she wa playing with it . as a conclusion , however , in the past i used to believe that the advertisement make the product better , i learned that it is not a statement , applying to every case . after all these experience , i learned to criticise more about the stuff that i am going to buy , and not pay attention to the advertisments . they are not that useful , a they are shown .
