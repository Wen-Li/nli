i feel that in twenty yeras number of car used will be much more than the one that are being used today . there are several reason that i can think of to support this view such a : increase in population , more dependence on alternate fuel , competitve pricing by the car manufacture . the populatin of the world ha been increasing in exponential proportion over the past few decade and i do not think this trend would change much in the next two decade . with the increase in population the number of people using personal vehichels would also increase and thus this would increase the number of car purchsed and used . even though the increase in the comertial fuel price might deter the people from using car , of late we have seen a concious effort made by the govetnments in varios country to use natural fuel like bio-diesel which would mean that thefuprice will be taken care of . even the electric vechicles woul serve this purpose . with the increasing globalisation the car manufacture would be competing with each others to sell their car and this might result in competitive pricing . competive pricing will lower the car sale and thus encourage the people to buy the car . the increasing number of car fianancer woul enhance the sale . with most of the govrnments laying emphasis on infrastructue development , the new road and flyover would help reduce the traffic congestion to a large extent . moreover this world is becoming so materialistic that i guess we would have to see a major calamity resulting due to the damage caused by the pollution berfore the government would place mre stringent law in order to retrict the number of car sale . even if law are passed to limit the sale of car it would take a long time before the state could provide adequate public transport serve the entire population . hence because of the above reason i feel the number of car would only increase over coming few decade .
