i sincerly can ' t say if i totally agree or disagree with this statement and i ' ll try to explain why . ideas and concept are the base for a theory or a sociological movement , but if you don ' t remember fact , date and name to expose in a discussion , how can you explain or make other people ' s idea changing ? in this statement there ' s the same topic of difference between theory and experience . i am an engeneer , so i studied a lot of theory and wa very important for me to understand concept before learning fact . but a i saw in my life everything must pas thru practice to really understand the value and the importance of lot of theory studied in the past . just think about newton ' s discovery of gravity . if i should explain people how do work all the force interested in that phenomenon it would take much more time than making an experiment of an object ( maybe an apple ! ) falling down to the ground . surely now that i ' ve practiced the theory i can better understand all the concept behind the main idea . this scientific method i think it can be applied to every field of culture and maybe to lifestyle . i can bring another simple example of what i mean about the difficult to agree or disagree with that statement and the difference between learning fact and understanding concept . in history there wa a lot of important fact and if we don ' t try to study and understand the psychology behind some character of an event , we can ' t surely have an our own opinion about it : so we see that are important the idea . but if we don ' t care about the timeline in which the fact happened we risk to lose the most important information of `` when '' , `` where '' they happened ! just think about the wars . are important thearies , ideal , and strategy a well a the date in which the war started and ended .
