i agree that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today . although vihecles is the most common traffic tool that we use today , but it should be earsed based on following three shortcoming and situation : fossil , pollution and traffic pressure . as we all know , oil and coal are unrevivable resource . the coal resource can only be used by two hundred year and the oil resource can even be used by fifty year . cars like many other traffic tool are the main consumer of these fossil . since we have not enough resource for the vihecle to keep them work forever , there must be a revolution of the traffic tool in near future . that will give out a new role so a to get rid of the car from the historic stage . these should happen in twenty year . in additon , the pollution problem is another important issue for today . and the car are the most monster which caused a lot of air pollution and noise pollution . the car work by burning the fossil so that they always pour out so much carbin dioxide and much other poison gas . some of them can get together with the water to make acid rain which is the main destroyer of the building and monument . some of the harmful gas cause warm-room effect in the city so that many plant will be dying in this kind of enviorament . in order to protect our earth , we should project the car ! resently , traffic jam is also a question to make headache . this is almost caused by such a great amount of car we are using . much time is wasted in the jam which would not make any value for the society . if people doe n't always drive their own car and take more public traffic , all of them will have more leisure to relax and more chance to make money . as so many car are not necessary , why they should exist any more , even if everybody recognize this point , car will not keep a long life on the market . so , a a result , car will play more and more little role in our life because of the reason above . and they are getting disappeared from now on . let 's watch the extinction of the car !
