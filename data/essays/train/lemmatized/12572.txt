i believe it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because i strongly believe that focus is a very important element for anyone seeking success . having broad knowledge of many subject doe not make u expert in any of these subject whereas focusing on a single subject help u fully comprehend that subject and have more control over it . without focus , there is no direction or goal . specializing in one specific subject allows u to research everything about that subject more thouroughly . it is easier not get distracted by irrelevant information when one ha a single issue to deal with than many . i experienced this six year ago when i started studying fine art in college and took class from every department including painting , drawing , sculpture , ceramic , fashion and illustration . it wa exhausting to try to practice all of them together , so i decided to focus on painting which wa the one i wa most interested in . now i am a painter , and i can say i know more about painting than anything else and this ha brought self fullfillment to my life . no matter how some people might think that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better , it is an undeniable fact that we have limited time to spend on each of these subject . expertise only come from practice and we obviously need time to practice . to put it in a simpler way ; who do you think would bake better cake : someone who bakes cake , bread , croissant and cooky all at the same time or someone who doe nothing else but baking cake ? i definitely think that the second person would have a much more delicious cake to offer .
