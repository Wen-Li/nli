i totally agree with this topic statement . being able to succeid in life is not easy . althought everybody wish to succeid just a few can really do so . succeid is an everyday fight . i think that taking risk allow people to improve their situation . moreover trying new thing bring a lot of knowledge . first , by taking risk people can change their life in order to improve it . for instance , someone who is living in a poor country and who doe not earn enought money to be able to eat need to take risk . if he want to be able to live in better condition he should for example try to emigrate in a richer country . in my point of view , this is a tremendous risk ; however , it is primordial one in order to improve his finacial situation . he will afterward most likely be proud of himself . therefore his life would undoubtetly be a success ! second , i believe that by trying new thing someone can definitively have the chance to succeid . indeed , trying new thing mean also get interested in new field . for instance a university student who take ( try ) different course will at the end of his education have a lot of strong knowledge . this knowledge will be a strong basis for his futur profesional life . i am convinced that someone whom is bright and excellent a school will most likely succeid in his life . he will find a stumulating job that will bring him joy a well a money in order to live in good condition . in conclusion , people should take risk and try new thing each day . those risk will bring them on the top and will make them successful people . furthermore this sucess will make them happy . however i acknowledge that taking risk and trying new thing are not always easy thing to do but i am confident that it important to do them .
