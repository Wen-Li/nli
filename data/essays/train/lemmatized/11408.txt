i do not disagree with that most adverisements make product seem much better that they really are . it is obviously advertisement ' job to do and also it is natural human being . for instance , when someone took a photo and they need to send their photo to somewhere they might not want to send their photo which look terrible . advertisement is really important that how to pear their product to the consumer . advertisement product can be seen a different a they really are because of the different angle and shot . they requires high techonolgy of photogragh skill with a light and background . moreover , advertisement ha a powerful possibility to let people know about their product and one of the way how the product can be costed . therefore , sometimes people could be angry with their product when it is diffrent from what they saw in the advertisement and what they expected though advertisement product could look much better than they really are .
