i do not agree with this statement that understanding idea and concept is more valuable to student than learning fact . i do not deny the importance of understanding idea and concept , but there are several reason to student continue to concentrate on learning fact . first of all , idea and concept are theoretical definition . even student can understand study concept and main idea , if they can not apply them to real society , it is useless . there are so many thing possessing gap between concept and fact . if student concentrate on only understanding idea and concept , it is easy for them to study just artificial area . can you imagin a class without case study ? it is impossible . even the mathematics textboox ha example of real life . it is because the importance of the fact . students can be motivated from real example and they can find the reason why they are studying . suppose that a student learned government . he or she do not understand fully what government do and why it is needed in the society . after he or she accessed numerous article dealing with goverment , they would percieve importance of government 's role . it is hard to understanding idea and concept without learning fact . there are so many theory and study extended for a long time , and people should know how they can apply study to real life . difficult theory and study result usually from the experiment of fact . people can not reach the eventual idea or concept without learning fact . ideas and concept existing for fact . learning fact will provide people motivation of idea and concept . consequently , it also make people continue to think about new idea and concept . through learning fact , people would have question about them and try to solve them , and finally , could achieve genuine result of study . therefore , understanding idea and concept without learning fact is not efficient to student .
