the modern world of technology ha changed the life of a common man altogether . advertisement technology is at it peak in this centuary creating ripple in the mind of people by forcing to buy the product thats are of substandards . newspapers , medium , printing technology , door to door advertisement and mouth to mouth adverstising ha increased substantially in the recent year . all the product used by a person from the time he wake up in the morning till he sleep are advertised everywhere and anywhere . the product company invest lot of money into adversitising it product buy paying a huge amount to a celebrity star , designing and redesigning the label and try to increse there sale of the product and reep the benefit . infact these company are ripping off the poeple . millions of money spent for the adverstisement can be diverted towards the maintainance of the stanndars fo the product . if the product is really good and worthy neither the advertisement maker or the celebrity participating in the adversitisment many not know the standats of the product are . for example , the fizz drink consumed by almost all in the world . it wa proved many time that the cococola or pepsi have pesticised that are harmful to the people . still the company hire a super star from a film industry andboost the sale of it product . consumer buy the drink jus becasuse their favourite star ha acted in the advetisement . many instance of healt hazardous level of pesticide were found . after careful observation and sufficent evidence i strongly agree that many product are of le standard than the thwey are advertised .
