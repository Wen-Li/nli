i agree with this statement . for example my mom is successful business woman . she started working for air china when she gruduated in 1985 , and she is the president right now after she had worked 22 year , she had a long journey before she did that . first of all is her english , my mom wa really good at math and science when wa in college , but wa weak in english , and she did n't know any foriegn language either . but my family wa really poor awhen i wa born so we needed money . air china wa a company that need language and experience more than teceniques and it 's richest inchina during that period of time too . my mom made her mind that she wanted to work there and get nice salary in order to feed our family better and easier . she went to the language school and had extra english class every night , i still remember clearly that when she came back her eye were like the panda 's . i almost begged my mom to stop doing that because she ca n't take it , she wa alsomt sick . but she said that 's her confifence and her goal and she will never lose . she wa the greatest i have even seen , she got a job in air china after 3 month because she passed the super hard english test . i wa shocked by her achivement and felt so happy for her . my mom did n't stop either although she had a nice job and got paid $ 5000 a month . she went to germany and japan for two year for more experience and language . who my mom came back and said she wanted to voted for the president of the entire company , i did n't trust her and said she wa crazy , it 's impossible . my mom did n't yell me instead she said that 's called faith to herself , faith to the society and faith to me . i promised her that i trust her . when it wa the chinese new year in 2003 , mom came home with the uniform of the president and cried , she did it !! we huged together and had the best night ever . now she is working extremely hard every day , get paid $ 20000 per month and i support her every day , the company is better and better , so doe her life and our life , because we are one . i have the money to pay for the fee of an exchange student , to take the test and come back for college if i pas this test because of my mom 's effort . the definition of faith refreshed my brain and i became more mature . i like this statement , i appreciate and i 'll remember it forever .
