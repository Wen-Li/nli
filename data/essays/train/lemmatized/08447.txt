advertisements are one the most striking result of the liberal economy . as there are very competitive environment for each good in economy , producer have to release commercial of their product . thus , either i agree or not , i will continue to face advertisement in everywhere . if i were to answer that question five year ago , i would have definetly said that advertisement do not make product better than they really are . i thought that producer do advertisement , in order to make consumer aware of their product . their main response should be creating an acknowledged customer . although i used to watch some unrealistic advertisement on television ; i did not thought that they are cheating u . unlike my parent , i bought a number of stuff from tv commercial and dressed or used them happily . `` i love advertisement , they make me conscious when i am shopping '' would be my exact word , if you were to ask me this very same question . today , however , a i am about to graduate with an economics degree , my thought are very different compared to five year ago , while i wa in a high school . i had a marketing class in the previous year and i learned so many thing about advertisement . during class time , we were analyzing some popular advertisement and found out how do they cheat consumer . i abhore the idea of cheating consumer . even the color that they use in advertisement are intentional . furthermore , once in a time , i bought a pair of boot to my father a a birthday present . according to the advertisement , boot had a waterproove technology , and i believed . however , when my father tried them in a rainy day , boot eventually let water get inside of the boot . do you imagine how bad the situation is ? i felt so embraced that day . as a result , i can say that i totally agree with the idea that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
