since henry ford ha given his famous staement of `` you can get whatever color you want a long a it is black '' the car industry ha always been one of the most important achievement of today 's society . with the building of new highway and better road that even penetrate to the most deserted place in country the need and urge in people to obtain a car that is suitable for them is growing . nonetheless the financial sector and car industry are encouraging people to be a player in this car consumption madness with new innovation towards the comfort of people and giving credit and financial support to people who wont be able to afford to purchase a car without the help of a deliberate amount of financial credit . however will this tide of car will stop in some day . it is obvious that with each day passing a new innovation is served to u in the car industry . that is the key point for the car manufacturer to stir the human desire element inside u a it is for sure that every single one of u mostly burn with the desire to buy bigger and more luxurious car a long a we can afford it . even sometimes we get loan in order to achieve our desire on this . in combination with this family have started to purchase car for each of the family member and you can easily witness the fact that in most of the family there are more than one car . this in fact is a very good explanation of how the competion and rivalry in the car industry develops everyday . if someone look from this perspective it can easily be concluded that in the future we , even for basic humanity need , will be using our car . supporting this discussion in today environment the weakness of public transformation is also an important encouraging factor for people to buy car . people feel more secure and comfortable to tarvel with their own car rather that changing several public transportation vehicle and reach their destination far later that they would desire . also having a luxurious and comfortable car is a sign of reputation and wealth in today world which may help people in their social and business life . despite these pro however there are also several point that may be cunted a con of the increase of car in the society . one of them is that although there are several research and development activity revolving on the issue of fuel consumption , the primary fuel for now is oil which is a really scarce resource in te world and which each day need more expense and effort to be harvested . whether we like it or not if new innovation such a the one right now , being electricity and hydrogen , caanot get common we then unwillingly will be saying goodbye to our precious car , another important point id the ratio of building more road to the sale of car a new car need new structure to travel on . thus the government try to give high importance to establish more highway and road for the new car but usually the supply is far lower than the demand . this in return create huge traffic problem . as i stated above people do not want to give up their comfort using the public transportation mean whic in return build a mess of chaos in the traffic . everday it is loading huge stress on people to wait for hour being stuck in the point and move le than 10 meter in an hour . lastly pollution created by the car is an important problem a most of the environmental pollution is backed by the exhaust fume of the car . however these problem lack the necessary motivation for people to give up their car and switch to someting else . in conclusion i would say that considering the pro and con above i would have to disagree with the statement that in twenty year time we will have le car . although the con are important point to be taken care of still car are one of the precious thing that the people perceive a their primary part of their life . it is unknown whether by the rapid development in technology will replace something else with our precious car but in this sequence we are having now i would say that there will be more car in twenty year time than we have now .
