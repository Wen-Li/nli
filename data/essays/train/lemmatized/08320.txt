i agree with this question . and recently , there are a lot of tour in japan . most japan 's tour led by a tour guide . because there are some reason . first , japanese people like to go to somewhere with group and it is safety to go to travel . if tour guide led u everywhere , we do not to think about every one . tour guide think about u . for example , how many people are there now ? or next , where do we go and so on . in my experience , i have been to disney land with my friend , and i led my freiends . however it wa very hard to led people . it wa not easy to it second , tour guide ha a lot of knowlege about that place or something . if i had question and asked , tour guide can answer the question . last year , i have been to the china , however i can not speak chinese , so i wa in trouble that i missed train , and i called tour guide . and tour guide tell me how to get to ride train and come back hotel . i felt tour guide is very kind . third , it is nesesally to go to travel with tour guide . if i go to foreign country , i do not understand what people say . so it is very bording . tour guide can speak local launguage . what 's more , i think tour guide know local imformation . it is very important to enjoy in there . if i go to somewhere myself , i can not to know about local imformation . of course , it is not free when i want to go to anotherplace in summary , i agree to led by tour guide when i go to travel . but it is very safety during travel . and it is important to go to
