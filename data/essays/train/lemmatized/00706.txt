this essay refers to the question whether advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i agree with the statement that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are because of the following reason : the first reason is that advertisement show only the advantage of the product and ignore the disadvantage . you do not get complete information about the product , about special condition and tariff and about the possibility of use . very often you realize the disadvantage of the product after the act of purchasing and you are disappointed that you can not use the product in the way you planned it . the second reason is that advertisement make you think that the advertised product is the best product you can have in this area or subject . but you do not know if this is the truth because the advertisment doe not show you a comparison of price and feature of the advertised product and the competitor 's product . the aim of advertisement is to make you buy product without thinking and without comparing feature and price . in my opinion , this aim and this way to sell product violates the principle of self-determination and is morally wrong . the third reason is that advertisement give you sometimes the feeling that you unconditionally need the product which the advertisement is for - even if you have never thought of this product before and you do not really need it . the advertisement can produce strong wish to buy thing , but people are not aware that their wish ist caused by advertismenet . the advertisement try by this method to increase consum and profit for the producing company , but very often you make unnecessary purchase and expenditure because you use the advertised product only once . the last reason why i think that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are is that they are often adressed to child . children mostly do not understand the value of money and do not think about the quality of an advertised product . they just want to have it and ask their parent for this product a long a the parent decide to buy it . in many case the parent do not spend any thought about quality and price because they want to make their child happy and accepted in the community of other child . so it is much easier to sell product with low quality if you adress child with the right advertisement . so in conclusion i believe because of the mentioned reason that advertisement make product seem much better and useful than they really are .
