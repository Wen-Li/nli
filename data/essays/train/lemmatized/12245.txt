we are living in a community and have some responsibility because of this . but many of u , specially the younger generation , do n't give enough importance to these duities . in this essay i will try to explain this fact by stating the reason . it is a truth that younger generation of the society do not pay enough attention to help their communnities . as human live in community , it is our main duty to help the community , so that one day when we need help we w 'll be able to receive from somebody else . but the condition of modern life lead to a change in this picture . younger people generally spend time on so many different activity that they can not find any spare time to share with the public . for instance , they attend some school , do different kind of activity in the school , deal with the computer and also deal with the problem in their daily life . as a result , most of the young can not find enough time to help their community . even if they do , it is very limited . one other factor that prevents young from helping their community is the misleading of the young by the community . this can sound strange , but it is also the communitie that is causing the problem . young people in the community are not tought enough about the importance of supporting the community . they have a lack of information on how serious this subject can be . thus , they do not clearly understand why they should help their community . i can give an example on this subject from my personal life . the last time i went to a house for elderly , i had the chance of meeting many old people and learning about their experience in life . they complained about the young people in the society and that they are not spending any timewith them . what is more , i wa the only student who went there for the last two month . what wa surprising for me in that visit , wa one of the thing that i heard from one old man . he said that it wa the elderly fault that they do not have any visitor now , because he even did n't teach the importance of helping the community , in some way , to his own child . as s result , even his child do n't come to see him . it is true that young member of the society do not pay enough attention to help their community . there are some reason like spending time for other thing and the miseading of the society on this subject . but it is also true that young should help their society so that they can find help when they need .
