when you want to travel to some place that you do not know , you have the posibility to visit interesting place with a tour guide . i am agree to travel with a tour guide for many reason : first , because you can know a lot specific information about the place , that you do n't know . frecuently , a tour guide is a person that is prepared to give information about the place that you visit , not only with the information that is written in the bulletin . for example , when i went last year to veracruz , i could know many history about the place , that i did not know , it not wa necesary to read the information and it wa so great the time that i expend there . second , a tour guide could give information about where and what is the best place for buying a present that could remember the place . because some time you may find the same thing or git le expensive in the place that he or she recomended . third , he or she could give a recommendation about the best picture , that you can get for you album . beside my opinion is agree to have a tour guide when you travel , sometimes i am disagree when i do not have a lot of money , and i prefer to spend it in other thing , for example : typical food or clothes . also because sometimes to take a tour take a lot of time and you may arrive late at place and you do not have enough time for expend by yourself if you have a guide .
