i disagree with these statement , that succeful people try new thing and take riskes than what they already know . as a person to be consederd a successful man he ha to carrey a good personality and a good amount of wise and a lot of knowalge to deal with his already known work for him or in the new thing that he is going to do . here i have a personal example about this , i am a doctor , and i am only understand in hospitales and medicine i open my own clinic and beside it i open a pharmacey , a the pharmacey in almost my field it is quite good project and it get me back good amount of money . on the other hand one of my friend ask me to share with him another project faraway from my field i lost a lot of money in this project , so , either you have a good background about the project you are going to do or leave it to someone else who know much better than you in this field and you can achive much more in your field that you already having year dealing with it than in the newly deveoped idea . another eas my friend he is a bussinessman in tourest and all thing related to the tourest like shop that sell thing to the tourest , also for ship and bus , so every thing and all of his project are related to what he know , so , now he is quite a successful man in the market . beside this , doing new thing give you advantage of proving yourself and feel that you still a creative man , and still you can be a succesful man throug all of your life , and people will learn more from their mistake , and every one have every day learning through all of his life it is better to be a new , creative mam than to be the same man every day , but for me i like to be new in every thing but not in bussissness
