while it might seem like , having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than specializing in one specific subject , i , for myself , would choose the latter . on first glance , having idea about lot of area seems like a good thing . you can talk about everything and you can reflect your opinion about everything . however , you do n't really knowing any of the area you talk about . the knowledge on all these area would be limited and do n't reflect what that acedemic subject is all about . as an industrial engineer i can give that a an example . when we graduate from college , we all have the basic idea about supply chain , inventory management , production planning , quality management , scheduling etc . however , during our graduate work , we end up choosing one of the sub-topics that industrial engineer work on . while a student working on scheduling may still know all other sub-divisions , he ha the most knowledge about his own topic thus he can talk the most certainly about his own topic a well . considering that we expect people to take certain responsibility in daily social life , and expect that to carry out these activties to masterhood , i would think the same is true for academic life a well . since do n't expect a butcher to do gardening , and a dentist to be an engineer , we should n't expect , say an industrial engineer , to be competant in both supply chain area and in quality management . a dentist is good at what he is doing beacuse he spent his time on mastering that , while an engineer spent his time on engineering subject and so is good at that . following with the same line of reasoning , an industrial engineer working on supply chain spents his time reading article about that particular topic , writes his thesis on that particular topic and neglect the other part of the discipline . time constaraints and social constraint limit one 's opportunity to know everything about anything . people knowing a broad range of academic subject tend to look and know the superficial stuff about them , while others focusing on a certain topic , by limiting their concentration , know that particular subject in depth and so are more valuable to the development of the particular subject .
