it 's equally important for a student to undertand idea or concept and fact . when student are begining with their education , they just learn fact . for example : that 2 x 3 is 6 or that balloon can float in the air . however , to achive a better comprehension of that fact , they need to know all the idea and concept that are behind it . they have to learn the idea about , fo example multiplication , to be more efficient doing them and to applicate them in other problem . about the example of the balloon , when the student , finally know that the principle about density is the responsible that the balloon to float in the air , they will understand better the phenomenon and similar fact too . we , the people , create idea and concept to explain better all the fact that surround u . a theory or state is assigned when we see a fact . for example , galileo formulated the theory about the gravity when he saw that an apple dropped down from a tree and hit his head . an idea or concept that do n't explain something that we can see in our surrounding is near useless . for what doe we can use a theory that doe n't explain any observable and measurable besides nothing ? but , in the other hand , some idea have helped u to see fact that we did n't saw before . for example , the idea and concept of the early periodic table of chemistry , suggested the presence of new element . this wa confirmed with the discover of oxygen , which wa n't discovered till several study of the combustion . it 's imperative to remember that the student will understand the idea and concept when they have the necessary knowledge and the mental ability . it 's really difficult trying to teach a kid of 5 year the idea and concept that student graduate school see . they will understand the idea when they reach the indicated age . finally , not the fact nor the idea are the most important thing that the student have to learn . to achieve a complete education , they need to learn fact and to understand idea in the same amount .
