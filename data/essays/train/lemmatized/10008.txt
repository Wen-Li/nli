i agree that is very essential for a student to learn the basic idea and concept from an early satge . facts about a certain subject can be understood only when a foundation is laid by idea and concept . ideas and concept form the fundamental building block in the learning process . it help one learn and understand a thought process accurately and profoundly . it help a person learn important aspect of a subject at an easy pace . when a student is given the opportunity to think about an idea , a new concept is formed based on the fact . facts can not be changed but idea and concept can be altered and changed according to the interest of the student . a student in chemistry will able to perform an experiment with ease only when he or she learns the basic fundamental . for instance , only when a student can understand the simple concept of what an acid or base is the , the student will be able to decide the correct step of an experiment . similarly a person who go to visit a modern art museumcan learn about fact of modern art from book , peer or from lecture . but only when he initially develops an idea on what modern art is all about , will he enjoy the art that is displayed . technology is based on idea and thought and not merely by fact . only when different concept are put together a new product is produced which help in the economy of a country . todays ' generation can not depend on just fact to learn newer concept . learning through different idea , keeping in par with today 's current pace will help one mold idea and thought for a better development . hence to conclude idea and concept are like pillar of a building without which a strong foundation can not be laid for the developemant of the future .
