nowadays , whether young people enjoy life more than older people do is a prevalent topic which ha been widly debated . two different view exist to support or oppose . after considering several aspect , i do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more . first of all , yong people have a strong study ability to learn new thing around them . for example , computer is a new technology product in nowadays , young people prefer to go on line for fun , buying thing on internet and making friend on it . because they think it may save a lot of time and money . however , the oler people may prefer to live in a traditional way , since they do n't want to change their life style after living under the same one for ten or twenty year . that 's why they do n't want to taste the new thing , though they are good . second , young people have much more energy than older people have . the young people may often go to climb mountain and make a hike with their friend to see the beautiful flower , blue sky and green sea . and after a long walk or traveling , they may recover quickly and go on with another adventure . by contrast , the older people do n't have this advantage . since they are old , their phisycial condition is not a well a used to be . they can just stay at home to watch tv or have fun near where they live . therefore , older people 's life is limited . last but not least , the young people are much more creative . when they see something new or interesting , they may think of a lot of question related , such a why it is so cute or how they make it . after considering about these questiones , they may go to liberay and disscus with the friend for more detail , and then they will try to improve it , create a better one . the young people enjoy thinking new thing . but the older people may not be so active , because they have a lot of experience . they may judge thing according to their experience and compare the question with the situation that they familiar with . therefoer , we can always hear that old people complained about the boring life . from what have been talked above , we may safely draw a conclusion that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
