it seems on the first blush that older people donot have got much work to do , so they might enjoy their life . however when one mulis over the issue with a brainstorming , it is the younger one who take leisure the most . hence i more or le agree with the statement that ` the young people enjoy life more than the older people do ' , by putting following example . this is the twenty-first century . what allure almost each and everyone of u about this is the ` rapid advancement in globalization ' . the world , day-by-day , is becoming a shorter place to live in . it doe posse all the amenity which are needed for a luxurious life . now , who doesnt want to visit incredible continent like - africa , antarctica , america , asia etc . ? well , i surmise almost everyone of u . but mostly it is the younger generation who enjoy . the younger generation do have a spunk and an energy within themselves which have made it possible for the world to shrink in the sphere of tchnological advancement . with the aid of technology , the youngers exploit good reason for having fun and enthusiasm . the wild party on the exotic beach of hawaii , itinerary for majestic and adventuruos wild sanctuary of africa and asia , and many more are done and planned by the current generation . older people , on the other hand , live their life in a solitary by enjoying in their way , a they become physically shattered due to the old age . however , the younger generation , often called the ` m tv generation ' - belief in a sole entertainment along with the advancement . for example , we often see younger people enjoy the safaries in serrengitti ( africa ) , a they have a privilege of exploring more and more a they are young . moreover , the amazing stunt of sky-divers and hearthrobbing experience of the underwater-divers are most prevalent amongst the novice and the young one . it is , once in a blue moon , that an older guy attains some accolade and is praised . to the contrary , the young person of the society receive kudos often frequently . this clearly explains that the young people enjoy in a much better way . however , i believe that the young one should not be sybarite , that is , there should never be a feeling of hedonism amongst them . as they have a privilege of enjoyng the grand and august life of this contemporary era , they should exploit it in a healthy manner , rather than milking out the pleasure of the other older people , who one were young and naive . it should be the blend of the older people 's experience and the vigor within the young which can lead to the prosperity of the world .
