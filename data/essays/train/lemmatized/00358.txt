well , i agree with the idea that is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , i think this because when you understand something you take it for you , that is better than learn fact , if you understand the idea they want to teach you it will be better for in the hour of the test to answer because you already have the main topic on your mind and you know what is the essential part of what you understood and learned , and in the other hand is also good if you understand the concept they want you to learn . althoug those concept will help you to sometimes answer and that is another way of learning . i disagree wiht the idea of learning fact because i do not think that is useful because that will be something you learn and did not understood , but for some student or people is better when they got the idea of the concept , and for some others is better if is something clear for them , something that they have an idea of what is triying to understand , for example for me is more useful if i understand what the concept and idea are about and in that way i can always remember that , another example will be , like i have a friend she always learns fact , and at the hour of the test is more difficult for her , than it is for me but the thing is that i understood the idea and concept of what is the topic or theme about , but sometimes is better when you learn fact and that is all because you did not understood the concept or the idea of what they are triying to teach you . there are a lot of factor that make student understand idea and concept sometimes is eassier then learning fact .
