from my point of view , i totally agree with the statement that advertisement emphasize and magnify some product in a questinnable way . for at least three caracteristics , which are quality , quantity and effectiveness , advertisement often misleading . marketing make u believe that the product we are buying is the best on the market and that you could not find a better product in the whole world . for example , mac donalds ' burger are often cited in advertisement a the best burger in the world . although i agree that they are pretty good , burger king 's burger are also very good . other example could be find with toy . children often think that that will have a toy bigger than it really is because of the way it is exposed in the advertisement . you could also manipulate people with the quantity you are selling to them . as for instance , a marketing campain could make you believe that you are purchasing 1000 kilogram of a specific ingredient , when in fact your are purchasing only 1000 pound of it , that is a typical trap . another manipulation from advertisement is to make a product efficient when this product is not working . there are countless version of advertisement claiming that a product is the one with which you will loose your overweight or with wich you will refind your youth . in fact it never work , but the marketing doe . as to conclude it must be said that people , especially child , should take care about misleading advertisement , because it could lead to many disapointments and sometimes more than that . marketing is a science with a unique goal , which is maximising the profit on the product it sell .
