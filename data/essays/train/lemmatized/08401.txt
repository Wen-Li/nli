on the one hand , i can not but agree with this statement . indeed , according to me , learning fact and being capable of remembering them all doe not prove that a student is clever . it is only a memory exercise , a kind of training for one 's brain . students are not dictionary , and i think we do not have to learn stupidly series of fact . on the contrary , showing that you have understood the key concept of a lecture is a real active process . it show that you have assimilated the lecture and it is the most important thing for a professor in my opinion what is more , learning fact is very boring and repetitive to me . it is something unpleasant i have the impression to do only in order to get a good grade . and most of the time , if this learning is passive , we forget almost everything on the day after the test . that is why to a certain extent i dislike history course : there is too much fact to learn . i prefer reflection about history with concept and idea a tool . unfortunately , we have to admit that some field of study like history require to learn fact by heart . that is why , on the other hand , learning fact is an unescapable step for student , especially freshman . in many field of study , knowing a minimum of fact by heart is an obligatory background for larger study and reflection . obviously , we can not seriously deal with specific subject without that very background . to a certain extent , the fact learnt are the matter and the idea and concept are the tool . the two work together and it is up to the student to take the most of them . as a conclusion , even if learning fact is something very unpleasant for most of the student , we have to admit it is an obligatory step . we need a minimum of matter to go further in what we are interested in and to develop a personal reflection on subject . maybe we could develop new way of learning fact which could be le boring , more attractive and that student could enjoy such a active discussion with professor , with specialist . .. we could sometimes leave our book aside .
