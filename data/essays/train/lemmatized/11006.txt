i agree with this statement for many resons . the first one is young people spend their time in other thing . the second , they focuse their afforts in other staffes . the last one , they do not have good support from people to help their community . first of all , young people spend most of time in activeties belonging to them self not for their community . for example , they spend time in playing , visiting friend , studying and help each others . secondly , they focuse their afforts in thing which it give the benefit for them . for example , young people may do some work with very hard work if they get money or at least a littel gift which it unforchintly doe not happen often in community . thirdly , they may not have good support to that nither from school or home . the reson is the school and home - speacily home - told them to do some thing belonging to them or make benefit for them without thinking in socity . i think young people will do some scoity activity if somebody give them a littel adviesment to participate people and help them in so many way . in addition , it is scoity club ' resbonseblity to help young people to give something to community where they live . finally , they some young do alots of thing to their socity and still . but the other doe not for resons which are minshond above . the young people have huge enrgy that should every body take care about it .
