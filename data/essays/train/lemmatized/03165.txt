when you read this statement , how do you think , in our life we have lot thing need to think about . for that question , my answer is yes , i agree that sucessful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . when everybody get high level , they will try something more harder . because they already know how they can do really well in this level , like in the school , why you going to school ? of course , study , because you want to learn new thing , new knowlage what you don not understand right now . except about education , in the life , you have a lot of thing learn too , for example , everyone have different personality , maybe you already know how is this person or how is that person , but on the earth , still ha many people we will meet , and you must try something new , to deal with how they will like you . .. when i five year old , i started to learn how to play piano , i wa working very hard , so when turn in thirteen year old , i got opportulity to went to beijing music school , but the problem is here : some how if i go to beijing , i must give up some class which i am good at it very much , but if i give up this chace , i will very sad , because music school is my dream , i dont want just stay on my level , i want more about music . finnally i decide to go to beijing study perfessional music . i wa so happy , i play piano better than other same age people and i try new thing , big challenge . even give up class i already good at it !
