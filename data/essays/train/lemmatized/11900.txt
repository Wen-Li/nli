nowadays car belong to our everyday life . seventy year ago it wa an object of social distinction insofar onlly upper class had a car . progressively the situation ha changed and car are become something common for a lot of people even if it is not the case everywhere in the world . in north countries it is not surprising to see three car in a family . however the situation seems to change once again for different reason like the lack of petroleum , the pollution or the town 's architecture . so , it is very possible that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the lack of petroleum in the world is one of the reason that could explained the fact that it is possible to see fewer car in twenty year . indeed petroleum becomes a really expensive product . if the rise of the price do n't stop it wo n't be possible for a lot of family to use their car . a second reason might be highlight . indeed governements are conscious that pollution is a fundamental stake for out planet . so , different policy fight againt greenhouse effect a the treaty og kyoto . furthermore it is obvious that car are partly responsible of pollution . that 's why their use will be more and more restricted . last but not leat the organisation of the town , like paris , do n't allow to drive in conclusion , in twenty year car wo n't be used by most of the people . taking the tube ot the bus or a bycicle will be easier and cheaper than taking a car , and better fot the environment . consequently , car are annouced a difficult future .
