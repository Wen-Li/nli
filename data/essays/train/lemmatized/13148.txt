yes i totally agree with the above statement . because we should not learn the subject but we should understand the idea or concept or anything related to the subject . this play a vital role in the educational skill and improve our learning attitude . if we are very poor at these thing we ca n't improve in our subject and we ca n't do better thing related to the subject . for example creating new thing will always be possible only when we have good knowledge about our subject and if we start learning everything from our childhood we ca n't grow more relating in the particular field and hence if we start understanding concept from the childhood then we can contribute alot to our field like by doing phd 's. , and then starting independent research area and start creating in our own way will finally lead to good consequence . so everybody should be guided properly from their childhood and have a proper skill in learning thing or fact . ofcourse childhood play a very crucial role in everybodies life and hence parent should take care of their child properly and guide them properly in their education , in order to become good citizen in their nation . if student wish to contribute alot in their field then they should concentrate to grasp the subject and potray it in a good way . this idea will probably come true for those people who are really good at their educational background and learning skill . that 's why everybody should learn how to apply skill in their career and they should interact with teacher and student to improve alot . if they start interacting they cancome to about their fault and they can correct them and adapt some good skill from their friend and teacher . so communication play a vital role in everybodies life . so student should maintain good habit inorder to acheive alot in their life and hence to contribute alot to their field . good learning skill are the only mean to get suceed in day to day competitive world and fast life . parents , teacher , friend and good habit are the primary thing that affect student 's life . depending on this everything is inter-connected and hence good family background always play an important role in child 's educaton . that 's why , elder should always behave properly and should think alot before they do .
