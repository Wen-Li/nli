the question is very tricky a people across all walk of life and across all age group like to enjoy and it is rather tough to quantify and compare their level of enjoyment . besides there could be people who could derive a tremnendous sense of enjoyment by the most trivial of act such a the sight of smiling infant . while there could be some who are never happy with the state of affair in their life despite having the best comfort in the world . in comparing youngster and adult on the mentioned statement , i personally feel that a youngster we try to live life to the fullest . though we realise the importance of making a career for ourselves we also make it a point to have a ball a and when time permit . older people generally tend to be more spiritually inclined and prefer to spend their time doing community work that brings them a sense of satisifaction more than the thrill of enjoyment . besides there might also be the feeling that they are beyong the ` age ' to enjoy life in a way a extravagent a we youngters can . also the fact that compound this belief is that a today 's youngster we have more mode and source of entertainment and enjoyment at our disposal than did the elder when they were in their prime . take for example computers and televsion , two of the commonest mode of entertainment today that were not even invented when our grandad and grand nanny were our age . this sheer availability of resource to u affect our ability to enjoy more . then again it is more a matter of personal choice or opinion a every person ha his own definition of enjoymnent . as per the way i percieve it i believe that yongsters today enjoy life on a larger scale that older people do .
