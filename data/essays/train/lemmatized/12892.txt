many believe that in the earlier stage of life , you are most likely to have more ` fun ' than that of in the later stage . there is even a saying in korea which say , when translated , ` enjoy life whilst you 're still young ! ' . my opinion on this topic is that , people 's enjoyment in life doe n't depend on the age of that human being , but the perspective , experience they have encountered , and the situation the people are in . my reason for believing this is because firstly , personally looking at my parent , hearing their experience of their daily-lives , i picture happy , laughing , relaxed people , not stressed over homework , project , test , what they 're going to be later on in their life , or their duty in the house . occasionally i even wish i wa a fully grown person , to have a job , and not stress over of choosing what job i 'm going to get . i believe that i am not the only one who ha idea simliar to this , especially 12th grade student , who are preparing to play their role a a fully grown adult in the society . secondly , sometimes when my parent have too much to do , they tend to look at my sister and i and say something along the line of ` you are very lucky to be so young , not to have any worry or concern on the problem of the real world ' . they say that they wish they could go back in time and re-live their life a an adolesence . summing up , i think that every human being ha a different opinion on this topic whether old or young , affected by their personal experience , the environment around them , and the situation they are in . a young one may look like they \ re enjoying life to another older person , and visa versa .
