i disagree whit the concept that young people enjoy life more than older people . i think that young people have a different way to live , to consider their own life than older people , but this way not necessarly is better . this depends particularly by the responsability of a person , the mind , and so by the style of life . generally young people , boy or girl , live in a particular way , doing differents action , having differents interest , so live in movement without long moment of pause . for example , i wake up the morning and i go to university where i study , in the afternoon i use my free time reading , listening music , visiting new place , and visiting art gallery . while in the evening i go with my friend to theater , cinema , pub , or concert . the old people , instead , live in a different way , because they pas their free time at home , in fact they don-t work , watching for example television , so they use their time in a slow way . for example i have a grand mother who stay at home during the day , she meet her friend at home and watch television in the evening . in conclusion young people don-t enjoy life more than older people , but boy and girl have other way to live .
