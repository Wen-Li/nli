they say that those who win write history . however , it doe not mean those who lose were not part of it . taking risk is a double-edged sword , depending on the ability of the samurai . a saying like this would drive a person to take unnecesary risk , without giving them fair warning that taking risk is serious business . back in my junior year business class , we talked about the risk-return curve ; which basically stated that the greater the risk , the greater the return . succesfull people who have taken great risk and in turn earned great return from it , can get away with rolling that statement around . it is a different tune for those who took the risk to high , and did not recieve a return . doing the same thing , is not entirley a bad a the statement make it seem . sure , taking a risk once in a while is good , but perseverance and constance are also trait succesfull people posse . it give those who depend on you a sense of security and stability , which is benefitial for any business . a healthy balance between taking and not taking risk is , in my opinion , a healthy adivse . more than anything , knowing which risk to take . being wise come with experience , the same way the ability come to the samurai wielding the double-edge sword . experience is aquired with patience , but also with a keen eye and an ambitious mind set to succeed . one must know when and where , but most importantly , why . in conclusion , yes , succesfull people take risk . but risk taken after deep analysis and gained experience . knowing when to attack , when to defend , and when to fortfeit is what make a person succesful ; it is what guarantee the samurai 's victory .
