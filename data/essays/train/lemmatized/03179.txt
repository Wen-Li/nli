advertising is nowadays everywhere , and try to make u buy every sort of product with always new way . lot of people think that they are manipulated by advertising company and that in advertisement the most important thing is to make the product seem much better that they really are . we can firstly think that a they use way of persuasion that we understand we can always have our opinion . it 's a problem with chidren and advertising , but adult may be able to have their own opinion . even if the advertiser tell u that is the best product of the world , we must be able to think about it and try to have our own opinion . advertisers are not obliging u , they give u the choice but try to convince u . in a very different way , we can think that their advertising is not just argument . they often use what we like , our dream and problem to make u think that we have a real need of this product . for exemple they often use our problem to sell u product , they give to a fat woman a solution that she can refuse , a she doe n't like herself , so a to become thin like model in advertisement . in front of child , if an advertisement say that his super hero eat this sort of ice-cream , he will tell to his mother that eating this sort of ice-cream can make him be happy . we have to think about what it can be and if we really need this but it may be difficult in some situation where advertisement represents all we want to have or be . in my opinion advertisement is a very complex marketing strategy , but it can not make the product seem much better than it really is . it just make the product be a we want it to be . products are created according to our need but we have to choose and be critic about advertising . i think that parent have to understand that child do n't understand advertisement like an adult , and adult have to always think about what he really need , what he really can buy and what is really new in the product . if they do n't lie in advertising it is possible to buy just what we really want .
