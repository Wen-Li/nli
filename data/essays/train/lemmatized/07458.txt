i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i am sure that the only way to learn is to try new thing . people have to learn their whole life to be successful . we start learning on the day that we are born and after university this process should not stop . in the modern business world there are always many competitor who want to have the same position . so you have to have some skill which make you special and these skill you can not get if you are afraid of new thing . if people want to be successful they need to be brave and take responsibility for their action . in addition , they need to have the power and strenght to fail and stand up again . in my opinion , the reason why so many people do not want to change a situation or to try something new lie in their mentality . i think that many people are afraid of trying new thing because they do not want to fail . they think that it is easier , more comfortable and better for their image to stay in one job position than to try something they are not an expert in . i think that people sometimes are rather lazy and do not see a reason in changing a comfortable situation . in my opinion , the only way to reach higher position and success is to leave this comfort behind for a certain period of time and to be brave enough to accept the possibility of failure . otherwise you always stay in the same position . nevertheless , there are more aspect of success . i think that luck , networking , social skill , the ability to work in team and continuity are extremely neccessary factor for success .
