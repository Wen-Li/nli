to evaluate what will happen in twenty year is a difficult task . one question is to know if there will be more car or not . first we will consider the argument given to predict a reduction in the number of car , then the evolution that indicate a rise in this number . nowadays the price of petroleum is in a constant rise . as the oil reserve are getting smaller and smaller , a oil crisis is predicted in le than twenty year . so using a car will become more and more expensive . maybe people will try to use it le , which mean a reduction in the number of car . moreover a the center of city are now overcrowded , the policie is to reduce the number of car in city . laws are enforced to limit this number , a for instance in london where you have to pay to use your car inside the city , or in paris where new public transport are being built . in twenty year we can assum there will be new and more efficient public transport wich will make car no longer a necessity for people . nevertheless i do n't believe in that evolution . even if there will be no enought oil to sustain the developpement of car , other source of energy now exist and will be developped . using biologically made oil , or electricity we will still be able to run car . moreover , if we focus on the developpement of city , we observe that car is a nessecity if you live in the suburb of a big city . as ore people will live in suburb than now , we can guess public transport , even if they evolve , will not be sufficient . last point is the developpement of china and india . even if there a proportionnally le peple who will buy a car in developped country , when this two country will be developped there will be a new market of more than two billiard people ! in conclusion even if argumets can be given to justifie there will be le car than today , i think there will be ; ore car .
