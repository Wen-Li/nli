in our actual society , which is currently developing faster and faster everyday , it is necessary to be posted on many new finding in diverse field of science . since every field is getting broader a it go , one may have to choose between having a general knowledge on several field , or specializing on a certain matter . i choose the second option . having a broad knowledge of many academic subject can be a good thing , if you can handle it . in order for that to happen , one would have to study different area , which would leave le time to know deeply each and everyone of them this would mean that , although having knowledge on many subject , they would be somewhat shallow . in contrast , it would give you a large list of subject to talk about with friend and family . on the other hand , specializing in one specific subject would lead a person to have a profound understanding of the matter . it is what everyone expects from proffesionals in many field . for instance , no one would like to have a surgery if he know that the surgeon who is going to procede doe not know much about the matter . you might a well get killed with a gun if that is the case . this example is suitable for any other field , such a economics , or even music . in proffesional matter , a person who know more on a single matter is more apreciatted than one who know too many little thing . to conclude , i would say that both kind of knowledge are important , but having to choose , i would go for specializing in one subject over having broad knowledge of many subject , because it is more important when it come to being a good proffesional , whatever career you choose .
