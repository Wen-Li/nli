i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , because idea and concept are the root of the fact , it is the idea that make the fact to exist and undestanding idea will help the student to be productive . first of all , in order to rely on some fact there must be generated some idea and concept . that is , all fact depend on some idea and understanding of these idea cause the occuring of fact . moreover , to learn the fact we have to understand the thought behind the fact . just learning fact will cause the student not to generate new issue and this will cause the number of research in the school to drop and soon there exists a generation that is not producing anything but always living with the one in the hand . in addition , it is only possible to develop fact in the light of idea and concept . there are fact that is supposed not to change forever like the fact of physic . there are law of physic and they are supposed not to change . however , there is one point that these fact and law replaced the old one . therefore learning a fact is not big deal but understanding the idea will develop the socities . as a final point , learning fact will just cause student to memorize the fact . however , if they understand the idea behind the fact , they will undestand the topic better . moreover , there maybe some student that handle these topic think about them and make some suggestion about them that can be fact in the future . in conclusion , encouraging student to understand the idea will improve the research and will cause the student to be open minded . besides , the student that are trying to see and understand further will contribute to the development of the society .
