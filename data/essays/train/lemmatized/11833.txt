which way is better to travel , in a group led by a tour guide or travel without a guide ? i think it depands on where you are traveling to . if i will take a trip in a famous city with several wel-known garden and lot of special product , i will choose a group led by tour guide . it 's convenience to visite the city and travel around from garden to garden on the tour bus and the guide will give many detail on the history of the garden . and the ticket will be cheaper than if i buy them seperately cause those tour guide always have group discount . i might have to buy some product in some perticular tourist store that the tour guide leeds me into , but i might also get into those store and get fooled even without a tour guide . do n't laugh at me a that is the realy experience myself in hangzhou . i visited hangzhou 2 month ago all alone . but i took a taxi to longjing moutain where the famous villige producted green tea located and bought some tea in high price just like all tourist did in group . as i would did so anyway , why should n't i join a tour group and travel easily there ? if taking trovel to some place like tibet , i will go without a tour guide . the purpose to such place is to experience how is the life of people there . you will not really experience it if you are in a group . the only way you can get into the local life is to travel with your bag on foot . to live a you are one of the local people . how can you really know the live there when a tour bus is waiting for you out of the gate and bunch of your group mate are talking about eveything the see around you ? there is no a best way to travel , but planning what knid of travel you are making and then you can choose if you need to be in a group led by a tour guide . you can always travel in a better way .
