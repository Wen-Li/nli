i disagree with that statement . because i do n't believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . because the population of world continuosly growing up , it meanthere will be living more people on the earth than today . so it mean people will need more car for their request or anything else whatever you want to call . if we look to back , our past will show u , we are always usig more by time . for example , if we use 10,000 car in the 1920 's , we are using over than 500 million car today . this is only one example show , there is always a good table showing u we always use more car than last year . and it will be going up like this way . lets look with a different point . there are car facility and others like tear productors etc . so always , they will need to be developing new model of car and other part . and we are driver or whatever we call , shortly people will be changing their car to another new car . in this while other poor people , i mean who doe n't life in good life standarts or condition . then a you seen there will be two car in use , if you will think other people doe same too , so can you tell me , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ? no there wo n't be fewer car in use in the future . if you look around and think that , when you were child there wa le car , but when you were growng up , if you think carefuly then you will see that car are raising with time . now look around , how many car there are ? is it wa le than the time you were child ? no it 's not . because there are more car in use now than past time . finally i will say we will see many car in use in the sooner future . if we do n't find solution for traffic problem , so we will be in big trouble . we will waste time in traffic and we will waste gas for nothing while waiting at traffic . also i think patrol company wo n't let it be le car . because how many car is there , they will sell that much gas and earn money . we can give many example like these . hopefully there wo n't be much car than today for more healthfull live . but my brain doe n't tell same thing . i think we need to work hard for this big problem . we need to teach people for social transport vehicle like bus and others . for a healty life we also need to use byscle . i will say again , i do n't want a world with aot of car . i just want a world in peace and clear and healty and without stress .
