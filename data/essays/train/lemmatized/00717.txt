young people nowadays tend to be le helpful to the community . i think there is quite a variety of reason for that phenomen . firstly , time nowadays is quite rare . there is a wide range of person and institution that require our time . from child to adult people have to do a lot of education and gain some practical experience . at the beginning of a lifetime parent and teacher want u to learn . some year later job is requiring additional education . it seems a if education is always a main topic in a life . nowadays thing are getting faster and more is being expected . this prevents young people from investing time in project that limit their own educational and spare time . secondly , especially in city live a lot of people . for inhabitant of city it is not possible to know all or just a large part of them . but before people deside to help someone , they often want to know at least some detail about who is going to have an advantage . as long a you do not know who is going to have an advantage , you need a lot more of encouragement . i made that experience a well when i wa learning for my exam . i choose a quite room in zurich to study . but i had to find out that a lot of people just do not care about others . their first aim wa to get their problem solved , which required a talk to other people . furthermore , society nowadays doe not really expect u to help community and therefore doe not honor it if we do so . finally , it can be said that a lot of people - a long a they do not get an immediate return on their help - are not ready for providing assistance in any form .
