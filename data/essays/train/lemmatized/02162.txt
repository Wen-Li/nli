nowaydays , there is a great generation gap between the youth and older people . sometimes they are quite distinguished from others . it wa generally agreed that young people enjoy life more than older people do . but in my opinion , i do n't agree to the opinion . in the first place , many young people enjoy their life so much . they are very modern and familiar with all the new-coming product . for instance , internet , electronic product , and newly convention are made great use of by them . they realize what the real world is and have their ideal life style . their idea is to make the world colorful , funny and full of significance . only by doing thing for the society can they feel real happiness . oppositly , there still remains a large number of young people who are doing nothing everyday . if they were asked what they are doing , they would answer they were enjoying . they drink , do sport , play computer game , change boy/girlfriends frequently , rob money or small item from child and do whatever they can . is it a real `` enjoy '' ? absolutely no ! ignoring the bad thing they made , they lead to bad impact to the society . from the view of some people , older people are considered to be outdated . but to my surprise , in some case they can enjoy their life much more than young people . in spite of their weak body , they will be laughing everytime . seeing the sun rising from the east , they will get up , doing exersice and listening to the radio . they will fill up their life with happiness . after they concern about the current affair , they will note down their thought and send to the goverment . in city , they will be a volunteer . the traffic manager , cleaner or a `` moving map '' are shown ever all in all , both young people enjoy life .
