first of all i do not agree with the statement which say that young people enjoy their life more than older peolple . i think that the way to enjoy life is different but this not imply what the statement say . today young people can enjoy in several way , respect one or two generation ago because is permited almost everything : for example have the car very early , to go out every weekend and spend a lot of money to take drink and to go to the disco with some friend . they can also enjoy themself organizing some party between compains of school or university . a friend of mine told me that he went to danmark a erasmus student and he descibed me that experience a a beautiful thing . every day he enjoyed his life going to erasmus party that took place almost every evening in the university place . he told me also that the mainly enjoy it wa the beer and the disco . in stead , the fact that the older person do not do the same thing it doe not mean that they enjoy le : they have only other interestes . the major part of older person are married and for this reason the prefer enjoy their free time going , for example , to the cinema to watch a particular film , or to go to the restaurant for a romantic dinner . of course many older people could have son or daughter and this imply that they do not have the same time respect the young people , to spend for enjoy themself . the have to do a lot of thing into house and at the work .
