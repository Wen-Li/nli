i like to travel with my father more than by myself . i always travel in summer with my fimaly . my father , mother , and bigger sister usuley go to different countery each year . traveling with my father much better for u because , he is the tour guide . frist of all , travel with a tour guide will make the travel short and essy , since the tour guide ha an experience in his plase . he will make my vecation more enjoynabl . scond reason is that , the tour guide will choose a good plase for me better than i do . one time when i went to new city i asked for a good plase to go and how i can go there . in this time i lost the way . so it save time to go with a tour guide who will take me there in a short time . and i do not need to think of time . fainally , first think i could teach my son in travel is to find a good tour guide . to save his time and show him more plases in one trip . which would be better to have a oneperson who can help me to travel and enjoy my time without thinking of how and from where i have to go to that plase .
