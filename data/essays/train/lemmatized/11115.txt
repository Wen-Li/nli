i agree with the opinion to specialize in one specific subject . and i will tell you about the reason why i think so . at first , recently academic subject is developing rapidly , and unless you have a deep knowledge about the subject you learn , you ca n't understand anything about that . before twenty century , the field of academic wa not broad and not vast , so many specialist could learn many field , but now we ca n't . second , the person who is the expert in one specific subject will get a lot of award . for example , nobel prize will hand in the specialist of one region like medical , piece , chemistry , physic and so on . though this is an extreme example , if one person would know any sperficial knowledge of any subject , the person wo n't get the nobel prize . at last , learning broad knowledge of many academic subject is very difficult . as the matter of fact , there is a `` liberal art '' in the university of the us , and university student is trying to study a lot of broad knowledge . but completing `` liberal art '' is very difficult in four year . sometimes studying make some university student exhausted . so studying only one subject deeply is the good way for university student . alhough i explain how bad studying broad knowledge is , there is one good point to study `` liberal art '' . if you know a lot of knowledge outside your speciality , sometimes you can get some idea for your speciality . because there are a lot of similarity between the subject to subject , you can be easy to hit the idea if you are trouble to write a paper or something else . in the conclusion , if you have a much time to study in your life , studying `` liberal art '' at first and then studying your speciality will be the best way to complete your way of academic .
