yes i agree with the concept to discus about that it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . because by understanding the idea only a student can make desitions currectly . by understanding the concept he or she can judge easily and can get through it . most of the student understand the idea such that they can do the thing better and get grip on that particular idea and also he can learn more thing about the idea he learnt . for an example a student preparing fo his exam coming over in few day , to get rid of that he must read properly that he must not forget that he prepared for the exam , so he must understand the concept of that particular subject that there is no need for mugging up or there is no chance for forgetting the concept he had prepared for the exam . understanding the idea and concept the student can learn the fact . for example listerning the lecture in the professers class there we need more concentration in the class , such that the student must understand the concept and perform well in the exam or in the seminar etc . by understanding the idea and concept he can perform them very perfectly . the idea like in the software field we must learn and understand the concept to perform well in our interview , and also in the running project . there is the only way that to learn the concept and implement it where ever it is use ful in our life . as mentioned above example that the many student mug up the conceptes and fail in the exam so there is the only solution for this is to understand the concept and inplement the face . most of the student will face the problem the reason is that they will not understan the problem and make them get into trouble , so this is mainly applicable for the student . understanding the idea and concept not even for the student but also every one can get benefited by this concept i.e understanding idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
