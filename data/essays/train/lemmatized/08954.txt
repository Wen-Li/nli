does successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing nothing what they allready know how to do well ? in my opinion , answer of this question is yes they do . first of all if one person know everything about one issue and he ha done lot of achievement before he wouldnt scare or worry about trying new thing or taking risk . for example after world war1 , ottoman empire lost war than all our country had been occupied by another country . in that time only one person , called mustafa kemal , had came up and took all the risk to survive our country . he wa general in ottomans army and had lot of achievement previous war . altough there were another general in army he wa the leader of new turkish . why ? first he wa confident , knew every detail about his puplic and his enemy . he wa organized and had analysied everything . he didnt scare to try to organize young and started to independence war against the country that occupied our land . he didnt have any oppurtinuty to get back our freedom again except fight . he had a lot enemy even from turkish because they didnt believe him . in 1919 he came to anatolia to organize new turkish army and established new repuplic . besides all negative economic condition and for some people only ha 1 % chance he did it . yes it took more than three year and cost maybe million of dead but he gave our freedom back . he established republic of turkey on 29 october 1923 . in that year president of united kingdom said one of his speech `` every age one genious come to the world unfortunately this age ha come to turkey '' . like he said mustafa kemal wa a genious and it mean a lot to me . to concluede if one person successful and already know thing how to do well
