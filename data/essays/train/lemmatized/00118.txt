in my opinion people always should try new thing and take risk to improve themselves . if people stop themselves in front of the difficulty , they never improve . to become successful people , we do n't must do only what we can do but , first of all in difficult situation , we must take risk even if they should be wrong at the end . if we do n't catch risk we never obtein important result in every camp , for example for example if i want become a very important manager , in the world of work , i will have to take a lot of risk that regard my decision . this mean that people that have important ambition ca n't limitate themselves in which they already know but they must search to improve themselves . at the end i want say that don ` t exist any person that became important limiting himself , but to become successful people need courage and to take difficult choise to improve more and more .
