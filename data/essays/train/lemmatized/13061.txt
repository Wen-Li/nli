i disagree with this idea . in order to make a huge success , people do not need to create new way every time when they discover problem . by doing that , they are easily lost their trail and are in danger of new tisks . historically , the method and discovery ended up with great success , most of them are based on old and traditional idea . for example , tomas edison invited the tellphone a the same time an other scientist did , and he could not become the inviter of the tellphone because he turn out his work three hour leter than the other scientist . however , he advanse his tellphone and solve the many problem the tell phone had .
