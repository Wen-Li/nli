from the topic , `` young people enjoy more than older people do '' . i disagree with the statement . according to me both the young and the old people enjoy at the fullest , because there is no age difference in the time of enjoyment which is to be done by all . and being born a a human being it is the must . but the difference is that the young people enjoy according to there young knowledge whereas the old people enjoy according to there age and knowledge . `` people here are born on the earth enjoy '' .and the sentence presented that `` life is like performing a drama on the stage `` which is done though all the part of the thing .. example : happy moment , sad moment , memocraizing and etc . . but in life not only enjoyment but also sad n all the tmoments should be take place so that we can know about the thing happening in the word and the nature of the young and the old people and many more thing to be discussed . even old people came from the young age which may not be said or to be discarded from the topic . young people enjoy in the way pursuing or gaining new thing such a love , friendship , etc .. ; which are the must for both the youngesters and the old people . whereas , the old people do by listening the old story , song etc .. ; `` life is to enjoy by making mistake '' this is done mostly by the young people to know something new they make mistake , there is no wrong in doing that . but just gain something new . there is no such rule that only young enjoy whereas the old doesnt . we have to make all the people enyou in this pendimonium . life is defined a l = live i = in f = fullest e = enthusiasm . this is to be kept in the mind by al lthe people on the pendimonium . so , finally according to me i can say that both the young people and the old people enjoy their life and must do to the fullest .
