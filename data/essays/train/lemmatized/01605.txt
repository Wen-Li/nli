it is a much debatted topic in psychology , in company or among friend what actually make a successful person successful . are there certain characteristic that all successfull people have in common ? characteristics that are essential ? do we for example need to be risktakers in order to be successful ? sometimes it is stated that successful people are not satisfied with thing they arelady know how to do well . they do not rest on their achievments but rather go out , explore , take risk and are willing to do and try out something new . i would say that there are a lot of different way to be successful . it is not only depending on the definition of success ( is not the same for everybody ) , but also on the area or subject in which you are working or let say be successful . for example someone that ha a certain speciality can be successful in a certain profession without that above stated charactersitic . a model for instance just look very well and s/he can be very successful in her subject without ever going new way or taking risk . s/he just ha to stick on what s/he already know . in other area i would say it is definitively essentail to be a risktaker . for example when you are working in a research department it is essential that you have good and new idea . that characteristic is necessary to be able to perform this job well because if you are always just thinking about what you already know there would never be any progress . another example is when you want to open up an own business . you are definitley going a new , unexplored way by doing this because you can not predict for sure how thing will develope . in my opinion it is not essential to try new thing or take risk in order to be succesful . i would rather use this statement the other way around : when you are risktaker and you like to explore new thing you are more likely to be successful than a person that always stick to the thing s/he already know .
