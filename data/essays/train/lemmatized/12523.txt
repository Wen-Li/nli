some people might think that it will be disappear the number of car within few year . i do not agree with this idea because the car is good transportion to go somewhere and there is not significant trial a alternative car . first , i can say that the car is the best vehicle to go somewhere . we usually use the car when we go some place . even though the distance is long or short , driving car is suitable for any distance . for example , when i wa in summer vacation , i went to 3 academy for learning english conversation and english writing and computer class . academies were so seperated that i needed to ride something . at that time , my sister recommended me to ride a motor scooter . because it wa cheap , i thought that to ride a motor scooter wa a good idea . it wa not good idea at all because of long distance for a motor scooter . i think that there is any vehicle that can replace the car because i can drive any distance even though it is ten meter or five thousand meter . secondly , people rarely try to develop the new vehicle . press usually say that we are in the situation of lack of petroleum . in this situation , most car company try to find the alternative energy instead of gasolin . for example , i visited a car company when i wa middle school student a a school picnic . in there , i could learn lot of information about car and the source of energy . the supervisor of that company told that car were faced of shortage of energy . in addition this meaned that we woud not make new transportation but find new energy . it took hundred year to make car and it is too late to make new vehicle now . that idea made people do not care about making new transportation for moving . i agreed with his idea and i can feel that few exerts to made new vehicle for money . i believe even though several year are passed there are still many car . cars are the best way to move and people hardly try to make new ca
