i agree that most advertisement make product much better than they really are . i support this statement for several reason first of all there is the durability of the product in the market . this mean that if i can sell a product in a mass production way there is the need of lowering the cost of manufacturing in order to generate more money . which in turn mean using bad quality product . in return there is a significant investment in the marketing in order to be sold . another reason why product seem better in advertisment is because of technological advancement . the use of several computer progrmas such a illustrator , photoshop and others have the possibilty of accenting in different way the beauty of the product being advertised . for example a macdonald commercial of a cheese burger , the size , the look of the ingredient everything is exagerated . this also mean being able to potray an unreal vision of what the product is . thirdly , competition , because the same product is sold by different party the best visual statement made is the one that is going to sell the most , even though the product could be the same . it is important to say that although this is a common marketing strategy people should be aware of this manipulation . specially by being well informed of the product being advertised in order to judge not only visually , the quality of the product . a company decision to use advertisment exagertion to sell their product protrays a lack of respect towards the buyer . and it is our responsability to regulate a buyer such manipulation
