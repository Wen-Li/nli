nowadays people use in every circumstance the car : in my country every family owns at least a car and sometimes they even have a car each . the car is actually a symbol of the contemporary society a much a computer or mobile phone . we all know how usefull and comfortable it is to go by car , and how faster we can get to very far distance , but we usually forget how devastating it is fot the earth . in my opinion sooner or later there will be fewer car : first of all , the price of petrol will rise so much that it will be impossible for a normal family to afford a car trip . in fact , on one hand it will be soon very difficult to find new petrol source because they are disappearing and they are able to regenerate themself olny in thousand of year . on the other hand , those big company that held the petrol distribution have no interest in developing new energy source that could be cheaper for the costumer . secondly , i hope that soon there will be more law against pollution : indeed , the government of all the world have to admit the fact that if the planet is too polluted there is no possibility of life for the human race . this strategy should start a soon a possible , giving money for the reserch of natural energy and giving more opportunity to the people to consume le energy and to pollute le . there are many way to do this : indeed , city should have efficent public transport , or maybe the people that use solar pannels or other natural energy device in their house should be helped by the government . in conclusion , there is the possibility that the people will start to leave their car at home and go by foot : i am quite sceptical about it , but i really hope that the people will understand how important the enviroment is for our life .
