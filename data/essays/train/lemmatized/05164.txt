i totally agree with the statement proposed . furthermore , for me this statement more than a prediction is a hope . with reference to this , it is very difficult to cram in few sentence my thougth about car and the way people are used to using them nowadays . shortly , i think that people would not continue to use car in such an eccessive way a they have been doing for fourty year , for the following reason : the cost of the fuel ; air pollution ; development of new technology in the civil transport sector . the main reason , at least in the nearer future , why people will will take the car more rarely is the increasing cost of the fuel . families have problem in facing such an expensive cost every day . in this respect , in my personal experience i already saw people living in my building starting substituting the car with a bycicle when they do not really have the need to drive . the second reason why people i think will certainly prefer to take a bus , or the underground instead of the car is represented by the air pollution . air pollution became a problem of critical importance in the city . people can not freely breathe on the street . the level of air pollution ha reached unsustainable ceelings nowadays and people are more conscius about the problem and started thinking about it and trying to make an effort to solve the problem . finally , i think that people will definitly prefer to take a tram , or a bus , because the technology ha made great step . in the future there will be not traffic jam , but only fast and safe public transport in the city .
