i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i will present a couple of reason why i do not agree with the statement . first , a technology develops , there will be more advanced type of car in use in a variety of way . . for example , in the present time , car are being used on the road , but imagine the car runing under the land , that is underground , or yet better , flying and running at the same time in the air and land . it would be possible to drive a car on the road and air like flying car a we can see those kind of car in the movie . technology is becoming more and more sophisticated , and it will make our dream realized in the future . second , there will be alternative power source available in the future . people who think there will be fewer car in use in the future probably considered the current energy problem . it is ture that the fossil fuel are limited , and other energy source have n't been yet practical . however , the possibility of using alternative energy source such a solar energy and geothermal energy is being intensively studied , and near future it will be much more real than now . in addition , a number of scientist are currently involved in developing feasible future energy source , showing a good prospect for the future . in conclusion , i strongly disagree with the remark that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . automobiles will be one of the best transportation mean available in the future a it is today .
