i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i think that this statement is true because often when i watch an advertisement i think that the product seems good but when i saw the same product for real , i think the opposite . however , i is the aim of advertisement to make product look good a a result people want to buy the product . first i think that advertisments never represent the truth and i am often disappointed when i see a product by myself . for instance the last advertisement that i saw wa one for food , some kind of bread which seems to be so good and tasty . as a result when i went to the shop i had a look at that bread but when i found it i wa very angry because it wa n't the same that on the advertisement . i know that advertisment are often opposite to the reality but somtimes i like to think that it would be what i wa espected to be . thus sometimes i try to see if advertisement join the reality . then i know that the aim of advertisement is to make people dream so i can understand why there are often far from the reality . moreover people like to dream behind advertisement and like to think that life could be better and could tend to be the one they see in advertisement . nowadays , there are a lot of software to change picture and make them look what people wanted to . as a result we are used to transform the reality and to brighten it and we are used to see the thing a there are not . the fiction ha barely take the place of the reality . therfor it is hard to know whether people have adapt themselves to advertisement or advertisement have adapt to t \ people 's expectation . in conclusion i agree with that statement but i do n't think that i can blame advertiser for that .
