the statment is really general and i disagree with that . i think the category of young people should be divided in different group . surely the first division should be of two big group : teen and young people from 20 to 26 . teens should go on studying becouse , a we now , their help to their communitie will be bigger if they can do some usefull work . but at the same time i think , in that period , a teen must hold a part of the day for his couriosity . people from 20 to 26 , that is the category in which i am , could yet be a worker on could still be a student . and i think in both of the situation they are helping their communitie . obviously there could be some exception of people that , for different reason , do n't found their own way . but they are exeptions . than , in italy , we can decide to give social service to society , also stopping to study for a year , and work in hospital or old people 's house or something similar . but i always think the better way to help your community it is to find your own position a worker inside the system . and to do that young people must do what they do . what sould they be supposed to do more ? i really would like to understand becouse i read statement like this from when i wa child . i think that the past world war did private young people of their youth . and i think that 's not right . so when i realize that i 'm living in a really beatiful time and in a really comfortable place i think that is a must of mine going on to study , improve my work and enjoy my self . and when i do all of this thing i think i 'm helping my communitie .
