in my country , the educational system both teach you to understand idea and concept and to learn fact . these two concept have their own advantage . however , i believe it is more important to understand idea and concept . that is why i agree with the statement . first , l think that learning fact is not a clever method to follow because it doe not lead to create intelectual stimulation . indeed , even if i agree to say that it could be a nice way to strike student by giving funny or odd example , the thing is that you can not simply remember all the fact you are supposed to learn . for example , during my history class in college , i had to remember long list of event and fact without connection between them . this wa so dense and unclever that i did not remember half of them ! on the contrary , understanding idea and concept is more useful . first , by understanding them you will be able to implement them in the future , contrary to the fact or event which you can not obviously re create . second , school is supposed to prepare you for your professional life . so if you understand the idea and concept , you will understand how doe it work and will be able to deal efficiently with challenge . for instance , i attended some economics course . thanks to my understnading of some key concept , i now better understand how doe the world work , and especially the political system . thus , because student are supposed to face the professional life with the most numerous key possible in order to deal with it successfully , i strongly think that understanding idea and concept is more important than simply learn by heart fact and event .
