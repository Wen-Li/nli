i agree with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . '' . first , a broader knowledge of many academic subject enables an individual to be diverse : being involved in different project , conversation , and work group . by concentrating on one single subject specifically , a person might always be involved with the same people , performing the same task , and thinking in a similar way . by having knowledge , a broad a it might be , of different subject , an individual is rescued from monotony and involved in interesting and dynamic conversation and group work . let u say that a student is specializing in biology . if he only work on this specific academic subject he might grow tired of having the same conversation and working on the same type of project . if , on the other hand , he included some subject on engineering and art , for example , he would get involved in different conversation , making his life more interesting and helping him grow , maybe even in the area of his preference , biology . second , knowledge of many different subject enables one to know , identify , and appreciate the connection and relationship between different subject . this is especially important in problem solving . for example , a specialist in manufacturing process might normally deal with problem related to equipment , tolerance , and procedure . faced with a problem not related to what he would normally deal with , this person might feel overwhelmed and not know how to deal with the problem . however , if this individual decided to acquire a general knowledge about logistics , administration , and human resource he might know , at least , what direction to take in order to solve the problem . knowing an array of different academic subject in a broad level compared to specializing on a specific subject , ensures diversity , scope expansion and more developed problem solving skill .
