i agree with the statement , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . maybe to learn fact is important to student . but i think if they understand idea and concept , they will get fact , too . i think to understand idea and concept are more easy to understand , instead of just learn fact . when i study the biology , and history in english , my tutor always give me an example , and idea . and it is always helpful to me , and i will never forget about it . for the foreign language student , the idea and example are helpful . because they can not understand the english well a americans do , they could not just learn fact from the book . so , the idea or concept are very important to them to learn fact . to understand idea and cocepts are more fun to do . if student get idea , concept , and example on the picture , they can understand more clearly . to draw picture or diagram , student will have fun in the class . it is like laboratory in the biology class . the laboratory exercise is so much fun , and student can get main idea of what they are studying . i think the statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn facts. '' is true . if teacher and student can learn lesson together , and if the lesson are fun , student would like to go to school and they would like to learn in the school .
