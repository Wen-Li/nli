well i think it 's very difficult to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do . the first quesiton is , what are old people , and what are young people ? it mainly depends on the person . let u say young people are between 18 and 30 and eldery people are about 60 year old . in this case , young people have other interest than eldery people have . for example , young people are visiting disco or concert with loud music , whereas eldery people are enjoing a good dinner in a calm and relaxed atmosphere with classical music in the backround . but i have to mention , that i also know people who are about 60 who still attend concert with loud music . for example the generation who grows up with rollingstonse or acdc still go to their concert . the only difference is , that young people normaly are in better shape then eldery people are . the older you are the more problem your are getting with your physical condition . for example , young people can make more sport . eldery people have to care more about themselve . maybe young people are often more flexibel but this is also a stereotype . after my opinion this is not very important to enjoy life . usually , eldery people can do the same thing like younger people can do if they are carefully . they even have one important advantage , because they usually have more time and more money to enjoy their life than younger people have . if they have enough money , they can fly or travel to each place where they want to , whereas the younger one have to go to school , to university or to work . the young people either have n't enough money to do thing or they have n't enough time . like i have written at the beginning of this text , how you enjoy life depends on your pesonaltiy and on your flexability . if you stay in life and if you stil have fun , the age is n't so importan for enjoing life .
