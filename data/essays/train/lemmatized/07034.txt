i agree with the opinion that people success more often when they try new thing and take risk , rather than only doing what they are already farmiliar with . there are two reason for this : motivation and chance . first , when people try something that can be challenging to them , they are motivated . in fact , they try their best . when people try their best , they have more chance of succeeding . however , when people do something that they know how to do well , they do not try their best because they already know what the limit is and what they can do with it . however , when people try new thing , they are motivated to learn more about it . also , they do not yet know how far they can go with it , so they are motivated to know whay they can do . second , when people try new thing , they have more chance to encounter something that is in their interest but did not know the existance of . what they already know how to do well is probablly something that other people already know and is farmiliar to all of them . if they take risk , they are more likely to encounter something that is challenging , but is interesting to them at the same time . if people try thing that are uncommon , they are more likely to be succesful because people have not yet explored that territory yet . people can feel that they are doing something special . i believe people should take risk and try new thing rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . it is challenging to take risk , but taking them lead to success . people have more chance of encountering something people can be successful on , which brings up their motivation .
