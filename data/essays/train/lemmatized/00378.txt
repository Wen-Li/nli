i dont agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than old '' . in the fast moving era everything in the universe is at constant change . everyone want to learn more and more inorder to compete with the computer generation . if person ha good job skill he or she is considered a intellegent . other wise they are beeing considered a mere pippets . so i feel older generation is enjoying more than young people . while i wa in college i almost spent most of my week end doing some assignment or preparing for presentation . my grand-father used to ask me to go with him for live conserts . which take place in the other end of our street . but i never used to go . because i have to work hard inorder to get good grade . he used to talk about those show for many day . he truely enjoyed those time . if one want to enjoy he need money . he ha to think about many thing , if he is the only one who is earning in the house . he ha to devide his salary to house hold expense , child education and also to pay tax . but when he get old most of the expences will be eliminated . like child education and tax . so this is the time they will see some money in their hand . so they try to enjoy it for their own life . not only that lately many young people are suffering from lot of stress because of work load . even if they get vacation they are not able enjoy that time because of stress . which inturn lead to many more health problem like high blood pressure or diabetis in their early age . but elderly are far away from all this work related stress a they are nolonger working . whoever have no tension in life they enjoy the most . in my guess thet are old people . according to me elderly people in our comminity are enjoying the most than young generation . they get sufficient to go to club or entertainment center to pas their time which is not possible for youngster .
