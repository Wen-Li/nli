i agree with young people enjoy life more than older people do becouse there are two main point of my view about agreement . these are that young people enjoy their life in technological way and social way . first of all , recently , the technology wich surround our life astonishingly immproved a lot . several decade ago , noone could imagin how the technology develop like now generation . older people 's activity wa limitted due to unsufficient technology of their life . back in their day , they had to use old style technology to accomplish their purpose , in contrust , it wa n't efficient . it took more time and energy than now . it mean , older people 's enjoyable time wa robbed by efforting . on the other hand , new technology ha very high quality . it succeeded cutting off wasty time to do something compare with older people did . so , younger people can afford to having a good time a spending the time to their hobby and thing witch they ha interest . secondly , by using a high technology , the sociaty of younger people is expanded it range . now , there are a lot of way to communicate with unknown people like internet , cell phone , and some sort of book . we have many oppotunities to know each other and to make a new friendship with new people . to know new people , we can shear the time and our thought . it probably more enjoyable for young people . however , older people could n't do that becouse a i mantioned before , there is no way to accomplish this method at the age .
