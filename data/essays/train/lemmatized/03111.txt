honestly , i believe that it is a better to be a virtuoso in a particular field rather than being a dilletante . a person who tends to grope at everything at once , ultimately end up with empty hand . to cite an example , i would like to take up the case of doctor . how preposterous would it be to have a doctor repairing your denture and at the same time trying to perform a cardiac surgery on you . i for one would definitely not want to be at the mercy of such a person . the new age world demand specialization . it make more sense to perfect a task , rather than to jump from one thing to another . in today world professional are in great demand . as the title suggests , one expects a person to be professionally involved in a field and not just pursue in a a hobby . i would not like to go to far to adduce another example . my grandfather , who happens to be an undergraduate in liberal art , post graduate in marketing , and a diploma holder from iift chose to enter an industry a alien a the shoe industry . quite predictably he could not get a firm foothold in the industry and within a year , he switched over to an equally absurd field , construction . my grandfather who wa not even close to being an engineer wallowed meaninglessly in an arena which tacitly required a minimum of 4 year of engineering . quite understandably he could not survive in the cut throat competition among the architectural fraternity . i regret saying it but he now sits idle at home , next to a dying hearth with his numerous degree lying straggled around him . he still ha 4 year till retirement but unfortunately not a company to approach . in today world , competition requires you to be an ace at whatever you do . the kind of in-depth experience specialization lends to a person can not be achieved by merely scraping the surface of a particular subject . to sum it all up , if one lay waste his power in trying to dabble at anything and everything , he merely end up being a jack of all trade for who this world , blessed with specialist in their own field , ha no room .
