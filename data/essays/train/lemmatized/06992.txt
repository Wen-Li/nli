yes , i agree withn the statement that the successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what already know how to do well . without trying new thing we can not establish or invent any . so by trying the thing that no one can do by this we get name and fame . moreover name and fame we may give the newthing to the world . without taking risk we can not get a new thing . so many scientist created thing that are new to the world that we are usng now . they work hard for the new invention . without new invention the world may not move in progressive way . so , by the invention only we can more . for example if take a computer at first time when it is created it wa very larger than building . so , by the new thougts and risk only the size of the computer is reduced . not only computer many thing that we are now using are came out by trying the new thing and taking risk . but in some case trying new thing may create so many problem and at it is more risk to moderate the thing properly . but try new thing may not that much effective in every case . we can learn more by taking risk . so many new project are invented by try new thing . if it success we will get so many congratulation by others . all the time trying new thing is not much essential . but with out trying new thing we can learn more thing about what we are doing . so , in my view trying new thing may invent so many thing that we are not supossed by not taking risk . so i agree with my conclus
