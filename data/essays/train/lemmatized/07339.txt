i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are a several reason to support my opinnion . firstly , in twenty year some of the developing country will become economically stable . when that happens , a number of citizen in that country will be able to buy new car . for example , china is one of the country . now , it is becoming a economically enormous country and a lot of people are now purchasing new car . secondly , in a lot of western country like america or canada , except for large city it almost impossible to transport without car . people can not even go to school without car . of course small country like japan have a very nice subway and bus system , but not all country are like that . it also cost a lot of money to make that system and it not top priority in the country to do this so i think the use of car will not change or even increase . thirdly , according to the development in science , the price of car will go down . therefore , the people who could not afford to have car will be able to buy one and it will be easy for people to buy second , third , or even fourth car in the family . these day in developed nation , there are concern about the fact that using car effect the global warming , and instead of everybody using car , public transportation is being considered . however , there ha been a lot of research on car that prevent pollution . toyota 's `` prius '' is an example . in conclusion , i think that there will be more car in use than there are today .
