i totally agree with the statement , i think it is very important for student to learn and understand idea and concept , that stand behind the fact . studying history for example , we 're better know why the first and the second world war happened , than knowing how every single country organized it trupes for the conflict . what i reffear to is the importance of communicate what are the reason of the fact instead of knowing mererly what happened that day . going on with the example of historic issue , it ha a great relevance to understand the reason , the ideology , all the complex contest in which a fact is in . .. even becouse we are supposed to learn about those way of thinking that led ancient people , and contemporary people to great success , and to great disaster . . what wa the thread running through these event , how some dictator were able to strike a chord in people . .. that is what should be widely unsderstood . if we consider other matter , like studying mathematics or phisical and scientific study , i still believe that is more important to understand how to get to a certain theory than learning only that formula . moreover , a a matter of fact , we tend to forget mostly of thing we learn by chance , but we easily remember what we totally understood , becouse we undestood the mental process to get to that particular solution . in conclusion , learning the concept and the idea , we developp our mental and logical function . this help not only in succeed to examination and testis , but in every single thing we do in our life
