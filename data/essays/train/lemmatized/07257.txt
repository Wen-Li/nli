nowadays , tourism ha become an important part of the entertainement industry , especially in the western society . people tired - and sometimes fed up - with their job always keep an eye on their agenda , waiting for the next vacation . but when this day arrives , people usually have to face a dramatic dilemma : do they have to travel by their own or with a tour guide ? this issue ha been largely debated for the next ten year and is at the heart of the political campaign of many country . travelling by your own implies that you can be organized : you have to book the hotel yourself and you have to speak the language of the country you plan to visit . overall , it will be difficult to understand the story and to appreciate the monument you visit , except if you already know the culture of the country very well . actually , the choice depends of the type of vacation you like . for instance , if i go on vacation to the beach and that my aim is to have fun playing volley ball and having a nap while staring at the sea , it is not obvious that i need to be led by a tour guide . actually i can still do so , but the role of the guide will be slightly reduce , since there is nothing special to visit . on the other hand , if you prefer a cultural trip , thing are different , and you might need a tour guide a i said belove . i would say that being led by a tour guide is the best way to travel if you fancy cultural trip . my point of vue is that i prefer travelling on my own . thus i can make cultural discovery and meet the inhabitant of the country i am visiting . furthermore , i can practice my foreign language . that 's it : next vacation i will go to a english speaking country , so i could practice my english . i will lose my horrible french accent . and i will not need to pas the toefl exam anymore . therefore i will no longer bother an anonymous corrector with stupid essay ; )
