as i have to respond directly i 'd say i agree . but actually it 's a bit more complicating to answer thios question . if i think a little about the statement i would say that younger people could and should enjoy there life more . there are so mutch possibility to have fun when you 're young like sport friend and activity like that which we actually do n't use enough . i 'm saying this because when i look at my life it sometimes seems a it could have been much more fun and sometimes i can think of passage in my life where i probably did the best to have fun . when i think of the thing i have to do and of those my parent have to there is a huge difference , especially when i get in mind my father day . he work so long hour five or six day a week so that when he come home he ha dinner , maybe take out the dog for a walk and then go to bed because he ha to get up very early again . that 's why i think our young life are mcuh more fun and not so hard a adult 's life are . the main point of this is the free time we can spend also during the week after school is over . but often i think of especially this time and i look at what i 'm doing in the afternoon or what my friend do . i can see a lot of fun here when we do something together and when we go to sport club and so on , but on the other side i can also see a lot time wasted by computer , drinking and those useless thing . probably there are child and maybe also youth who actually never or at least seldom do such thing but even those who spend there time with this still have more great hour together then adult do . of course , there are advantage do be an adult , also when you look at the fun you have . if adult then after the lonk week have fun together this fun probably is `` much more fun '' then our `` youth fun '' and maybe it 's weight is just the same a that one of working .
