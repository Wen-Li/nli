the term `` knowledge '' a we see ha a ample number of branch to be described . one such branch that we are about to see is that of a student academic . a man is simply a learner in his own life . lets consider the case of an individual when he is in childhood stage . as a child he learns to crawl , eat , play etc . in this context he is a learner to go through all the varied functionality associated to him . later come the stage of being a grown up boy . here would prefer to walk on the ground rather than crawling , thus his interest ha got confined . in a similar way when we consider the case of a individual pursuing his academic . its would be better to excel in one specific subject rather than going through various subject . this would be beneficial not only to the individual but also to the career that he opts for . consider the case of an engineer , if he is made to go through the subject like , politics , medicine etc. then it would be infered that the chance of becoming an engineer are bleak . the same case may not be applicable to all other case . when we take the above case of an sucessful engeineer we can clearly state in the maximum case that , the inividual ha had a plenty of overview of his interest and the subject that he ha studied . on the other hand a person with only confined knowledge would excel only in his choosed field rather than being aware of the happening around him . lets take the case of any political leader . as we know leader are not born a leader , they are the people coming from different field . a leader may be a doctor , engineer , farmer etc . so the individual a a leader ha to be aware of all the happening going around him and also his region , province , country etc . thus here in this case we can say that a mere confined knowledge is not enough to be a perfect individual . so we can say that the method of having a broad knowlege of academic subject depends upon how an individual approach it , rather than making it a controversial methodology
