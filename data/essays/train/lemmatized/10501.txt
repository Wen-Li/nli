i agree that `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' because their main purpose is to sell people their product of service , and they would do whatever it take to increase their profit . a typical example of this marketing strategy would be the advertisement used in the food industry . some can , box or bag show their product really big , juicy and seeming tasty . however , when the costumer open the product , he see that the product is much smaller and most of the time is not even similar to the product they were showing in the package . some fast food restaurant also show tasty picture of their product , usually hamburguers , hot dog , or sandwich . these meal seem to be much bigger than they really are , with fresh vegetable and soft bread . but when the costumer actuallly recieves the meal , it turn out to be a small common burger . no only the food industry us those trick . a major industry that not only highlight the product itself , but the benefit it offer to the final user , is the beauty industry . this industry includes make ups , magic pill , gel or cream and all sort of product that promess to make someone beautiful , skinnier of younger . when trying to sell their newest product . it is typical to see the `` before and after '' ad , showing a fat lady and then after taking the pill , or applying the gel or cream , she look much better , skinny and healthy . a variety of example could be provided of how marketing people maximize the product ' capacity . but the thing is that they actually do it and it is not properly regulated . this is not only unethical for the costumer who buy the product , but for the potential costumer who is thinking about purchasing it . in my opinion , the solution for this problem is legal regulation . i think that all product ' ad that show better product than they actually are , should be taken away from the store . besides , if any client complains about a product that did not met his or her expecations based on the product advertisement , should get their money back . if a proper solution is not implemented , more people will be affected and finally , the company will loose actual and potential costumer , since no one want to be mocked again . and a costumer that is lost , is lost forever .
