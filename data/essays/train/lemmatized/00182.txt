in this period of time advertisement have a very strong impuls and influence in people 's life . first of all i have to say that i wa born in this generation where the industry more or le can not survive without advertisement . from sharing experience with my mother and reading magazine from the '' sixty '' , even back then advertisement played a big role in selling product . i agree with the fact that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are because that 's the best way to win customer . human being of course , only want to see , touch , feel , smell .. etc. the best a product can offer with the sens god gave them . regardless of the fact that a lot of product have disadvantage , people are prone to be blinded by the beauty and the advantage of the product itself . for instance , a simple product like '' soap '' , ha to fulfill it purpose . as a young lady i want to have soap that smell good , look good , a kind of soap that smoothens or even whitens my skin . it is proven and i have read a survey oh how many people read information on the package of the soap if this kind of soap is dermatologically tested or not . the low amount of customer that read this information stroke me . all what people want is what give them a good impression in any art of medium . newspapers , magazine , poster , tv and radio advertisement will try to do their best in this competitive world market . in order for a product to seem better , advertisement company would do everything to attract people . as i have mentioned there is great competition in the market . and i have learned during my highschool time of strategy advertisement take . for instance , if they want to attract young people the advertisement company will use a model who is popular , like a famous soccer player or a politician who wil of course try to impress and catch the eye of the viewer by wearing '' nike shoes '' . if one person buy those nike shoe , everybody else will . that | 's how we people are . i am aware that advertisement are exagerated and sometimes full of lie but i can not deny that i am a victim of this trend .
