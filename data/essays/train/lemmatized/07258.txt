it is essential to have broad knowledge of many academic subject in order to specialize in one specific subject . once an indivudual ha accquired a reasonable amount of knowledge on different academic subject , concentrating on a specific area of interest can be estremely beneficial . a teenager that want to study medicine ha to complete four to five year of med-school in order to specialize on a specific area of medicine . this is simply an example which can be applied to any other career choice in order to demonstrate the importance of a how general knowledge and common sense contribute to the success of any professional . when someone concentrate all their attention on a specific subject , he is creating a social barrier for himself . this social barrier consists on the following : when attending a social event , the communication this individual will have will be limited to his specific subject of interest . he/she will not be able to have great imput in a conversation between the people present because he/she will be focused on another subject most of the time . when attending college , this change . in my opinion , it is ideal to take one or two year of basic study or liberal art in order to have a strong base and be successful the following year . on the other hand , any professional that want to be prosperous in his career , will have to , at one point or another , focus most of his attention on his major or profession . this doe not mean that he/she will have to alienate himself from the world in order to do so . `` knowledge equal power '' , and in order to say that someone is knowledgable , he ha to have a vast scheem of interest and passion . when a balance in education and knwoledge is achieved , power and prosperity is the next step .
