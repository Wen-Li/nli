everybody dream secretly to be succesful at least one day in their life . to reach it , i am completly agreed to say that a good receipe for sucess is to take risk and try new thing rather than following the normal pattern of life . in fact , you need to show some caracteristics and to have the good personnality to accomplish this dream . first , i think that if you want to have sucess in your life , you need to risk a lot . you need to be strong and positive . there is a saying in french which is `` qui risque rien na rien '' . this mean that if you do not try , you are going to have nothing . for exemple , if somebody want to start his own business and he need to put everythings he ha for it , this person is taking a enormous risk . maybe he need to take all his money to invest in his compagnie . doing that , this person can lose everything but can also succeed , and becaome rich . and all this is because of all his effort and risk he took . futhermore , a second thing is necessary to reach success . this important thing is to be able also to try new thing . sometime , you can not be sure about doing something but i think people who really succeed are them who try everything even if they are not sure at 100 % . these person just feel it and they go for it for exemple , any artist need to try new thing to keep their success . people around them are there to giving them tip and the artist need to chose which new thing they are going to try . it is not all the time really easy but it is part of the receipe to success . if you think about all the sucessful people , you will realise how much they had taken risk in their life
