the `` understand '' function is an asset when it come to learn something . learning without understanding can bring people to a simple repetition or reproduction of what they have learn . robots , and ape used during experiment learn th way . the pavlov experiment when a dog learn to be prepared for food-time instinctively is a great example to show that learning do not require much effort . human being have more faculty to develop by understandig , though they still have to learn . understanding a concept developed in class help the student to relate this concept to similar situation where the concept wa applied . the student , in th case , is able to review the concept in any kind of situation and is free from his book theory for this part of the subject . for example if someone do not understand the concept of what is the natural purpose of having sex , this person might be interested by the fact that having sex just provide him a personal satisfaction . on the other hand , by understanding the concept , he would know that he is not the only one being pleased , that the sex can bring a child , and we can go further if we consider the psychological , and physical dimension of a human . as for the example , the student might understand the concept , learn better the subject , be able to transmit the idea to others , and find more example for explanation of what he have learn . in addition without frequent repetition the student will be able to recall the concept and then the fact more faster than a simple fact learning ( view a a repetitive exercise ) . it is difficult to visualize a fact that you have never learned , or experienced from a book . because more academic book present concept first , then example ; it would be more easy for a student who understand the concept to create an example of his own and go further in the lesson that one who only lern the example . at the test the one who learn is more likely to answer wrong a lot of question related to the concept he never understood . history ha shown that research are developed by people who understood the concept left by others . they devevelop the concept , and then use experiment and example to support and verify their view . as student are supposed to study the matter they are faced to , it is more important for them to `` understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
