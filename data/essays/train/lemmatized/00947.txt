i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . advertisements are to help the company to commercial their own product to people , to make better profit out of it for themselves . then with that fact , it is obvious that they should make the product seem much better so that people would buy it more . i myself , and everyone might have experienced it at least once in their life , that whenever you go to resturant or stop at the food place , you will see all these picture of the food in the menu . they all seem very delicious and look nice , but sometimes it doe not taste or look a what you expected it to be . advertisements doe this to make you eat their food , which will help them to make money for themselves . no one will want to waste their money by purchasing anything wrong or bad . people look for better and good one 's for themselves , therefore , advertisement try to show best ability out of the product a much a they can . sometimes even by making up the fact that really doe n't refer to the actual product , they compeat with other company to sell more of their product than other 's . in my opinion , it is understandable that they do this . since we already know that most of product are commercialized and exaggurated in a better and good way by the advertisement , we could avoid buying any fake or bad product . plus , it actually feel better for u to buy something that ha more fancy and nicer advertisement than the one that are not very commercialized . becuase by that we could know if the company is well and rich enough to support the product , which again will tell u that company ha been making good profit for themselves by a lot of people who ha been buying their product . therefore , i agree the fact that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are which is true and understandable in many way .
