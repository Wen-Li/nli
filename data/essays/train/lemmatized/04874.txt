the young people of today are very commonly reffered to a the leader and the great mind of tomorrow , yet we find ourselves asking wether the youth help it community . my responce to this would be that the young people are just a concious a the elder and they fell just a responsible for the welfare of the community . to ensure that the young adult feel responsible towards their community , they are inculcated with these value a child by making the child feel more responsible towards their srounding world . this is done by incorporating a community service section into their school curriculims and allowing the child to discover the satisfaction of sharing . these young influence are carried along with the youth and a they grow , so doe their sense of responsibility to society . then these young people do infact spend time from their busy schedule to serve the community . nowadays we continually see student-run organization and event that are held for the benifit of the community and also function a awareness program to show the adult of the community what the problem within their own sorroundings are . the profit from these type of fund are then put into good use to benifit society . one such example in my life that we , a the student of my school achieved for the international organization , the red cross wa that we had a fund raising event that wa in the form of a party to the young childre . we had ortganzed game and other such event that fascinated the kid and earned u enough money to make a considerable donation to the foundation for earthquake relief in gujrat , india . i would like to draw attention to the fact that the young people of today are just a concerned for the preccious comunity that we live in a are the adult . after all , what is the point of being a leader tommorrow if we can not preserve our community and hertage today ?
