is it more importent for student to understand idea and concept than it for them to learn fact ? this question offenly asked by parent that have dificultis with the academic level of thier child . in my opinion it better for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . an idea or a concept may sometimes be the result that becomes a fact . so if we understanded the idea we could conclude the fact but if we memroize a fact we can not conclude it idea since we dont no have the main base which is the idea . if we take for example ineshtine , when he discovered the nuclears a wide path of both good and bad invention were discovered . the teacher in the school explains for student idea and concept then let them memorize fact becouse sometimes a whole lesson can talk about one idea that result many fact . if you want to understand and memorize the lesson 's fact you must know the main idea that the lesson is talkin about . solving a math problem is the best example for this idea . supose u need to prove the fact that this equation is defined or not , you will began solving using the conepts and evntually end up with fact that it defined or not . although a fact seam to most of u easier to memorize than understanding a concept or an idea . but if we only memrized a fact it will have no meaning or no logical explanation for it in our mind , so a a result , we forget it quickly . but if we knew the idea or the concept tne memorization will take no time and the fact will live in our memory for ever . finally , knowing and idea and a concept is much better than memorizing a fact and if the fact wa described a a location , i guess that the idea will be the bridge that will lead you to that location .
