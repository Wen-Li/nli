ideas and concept are very important to understand about the particular topic because without understanding the main concept about the particular topic one can not learn the fact hence in my point of view it wa very important for student to know about the main idea and concept of the particular topic . for example one student wa planned to pursue biotechnology course in masters degree before knowing about the main idea mean it application and idea mean what about the future job aspect in this course , what is the use of learning about the fact that in biotechnology mean many new medicine for many disease can discover ? aristotle wa the ` father of biology ' , let u think how he became . the anawer we got wa by studying about the main concept in biology and also gregor johan mendel who studied about the concept of pea plant and understanding the idea only he discoverded laws of inheritance . not only the above mentioned scientist louis pasteur by understanding the concept that microorganism are responsible for souring of wine , converting milk to curd , made him to discover many new finding in microbiology . so my final conclusion wa by learning the concept and main idea student can excel in their life like the above mentioned scientist not by only revealing and studying the fact
