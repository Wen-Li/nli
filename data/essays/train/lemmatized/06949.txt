some people say `` no risk , no fun '' and because of this no profit and furthermore no success . i definitely agree with these people and with the given statement . of course there are witnessed example of successful people who just copied idea in order to earn big profit . of course many people who do not run a business in which risk and creativity are daily question , are able to realize a nice career a well a high wage . and of course people who define success in a completely different way such a being a member of a kind of club maybe even the captain of a bowling team are successful with a high degree of riskaversion . but from my point of view people are only successful if they are able to change their environment significantly . i do not reffer to the direct environment a the personal social context of an individual . i am talking about changing the whole society or at least the business sector you are concerned with . what would our world look like without great reformer and visons of few people ? personalities like m. l. king , adam smith or mahatma gandhi changed their society with their invention , theory or opinion . but without taking risk or thinking in new dimension , development that occured a a result of their thinking would not have been possible until now . to be successful it demand a low level of riskaversion , a genious strategy ( that can be a simple strategy a well ) and the ability to implement it . and fact you already know might be the basic knowledge to explore several idea but without risk and the willingness to do something completely new success can not be realized . finally i totally agree with the given statement . i would like to strengthen my opinion again by repeating that from my point of view risk and success are strong partner that can not be changed .
