i support the idea that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i hold this believe because car have already caused too many damage to the environment and use a lot of natural resource , hence they will be eventually superseded by other highly environmental friendly transportation tool . let 's look at first what car have brought with u over the decade : pollution , trafic accident , waste of iron and used up of oil etc . those negative effect have already impact our life a lot . such a people will loose their best friend or relative during a trafic accident . more importantly , the negative espect also impact our enrionments . we all know that the world becoming warmer and warmer , while one primary factor contribute to the global warming is the excessive immission of gas used by million of car everyday etc . this harmed our world 's air and damaged the environment . consider all these negative impact , there are voice that already recommend to ban the production of car . further more , twenty year later , a producing more car will turn out to be not realistic because of the tightier resource constraint , people will stop producing car and turn to produce other transportation tool . given the rapid technology improvement , i stronly believe that car will be finally superseded with another more advanced transportation tool . this can be true after sentific research and many experiment . imgine a life that we can go anywhere via jet plane that similar like the situation just a dipicted in the fiction film . then , our life will be totally different a what we are today . in conclusion , twenty year from now on , i belive that there will be fewer and fewer car in use than there are a of today a a combined effort of sentists and the public . lets cross our figure to wish the environment of the world , the dearest place that we live together , can be better and better after our mutual effort for example to find other transportation tool that are more environmental friendly than car !
