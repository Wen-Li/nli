i disagree with the statement . from my point of view , i think it is more important for student to learn the fact rather than understanding idea and concept . my reason my go a the follows . starting off with the disadvantage for learning the concept , student will have a hardship to get invoulved in the society . although a student can be armed with lot of knowledge or deep thought , it is still unable for them to aknowledge the sofiscated society with out learning the fact . for instance , a graguade student form a well known university , it is still quite diffcult for him to find a job without any experience . that is why university offer many co-op program for the student . another point i would like to share is that learning fact can help the student with understand the idea and principle . a perfect example for this will be the experiment in school . many school spend thousand of money to improve the lab facility for student . that mean student should not only learn the principle but they need to know how doe the thing function in reality a well . practise make progress . in addition , learning the fact can help the student in handling the problem . this point happens alot on the soccer field . as well know , every team ha their own plan for the game . however , thing can be changed suddenly in the field . by the time the plan doe not work , the player on the field have to make change to slove the problem . and there it show the valueable of the experienced player . they encountered this kind of fact before , so they are quite good at it . to conclude , learning the fact is more important for the student because the several reason listed above .
