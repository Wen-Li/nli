cars are the main mean of transport these day in many part of the world . but i do not think that this would be a case in twenty year from now . many reason can be stated in support of this thesis . the first reason is that the cost of fuel is growing at an alarming rate a the petroleum reserve are becoming scarce . also there is no alternative to petroleum which is environmental friendly and economical . this will surely reduce the dependence of middle class on car . the second reason is that today 's city are growing at a rapid pace due to the migration of villager to the city in search of better work and living condition and also due to industrialization . this will increase the time taken to travel to work and other place . also there are traffic jam which can further increase the time . so people may prefer public transport like the rapid transit system which is cheap and fast . this will also help in the government in generating more money which it can spend for other useful purpose . the third reason is that there may be a new invention which can transport people quickly and comfortably . no type of transport wa constantly used from the time of early man . from horse to automobile man ha come a long way in inventing new type of transport . after such an invention the car might become a museum exhibit like the horse drawn cabin of the past . all these point can considerably bring down the number of car runing on the road . finding out new form of energy which are both renewable and environmental friendly should be an important concern of today 's government .
