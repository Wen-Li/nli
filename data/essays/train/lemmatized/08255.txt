it is a very interesting topic . as we know , every one want to be a knowledgebal person . being knowledgebal is very impotant and atractive . i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . now i will explain the main reason . having broad knowledge of many acadimec subject is better than ti specialize in one specific subject . a person who have broad knowledge of many academic subject is very wise and good , because he will have many information about all subject but these information were general information not specific information . as i see these general information will be good for this person , becaus if anyone ask him a question about any subject , he might know the answer . the main reason that the person who have broad knowledge of many academic subject , he will have self confedence on his self . on the ather hand , some people thought that if they learn about many subject , they will not be concentrate and they will be confused . as i see it also good to specialize in one specifi subject , to concentate well on it . to summarize , i encouredge people to learn about many subject not only one . also in univercitise
