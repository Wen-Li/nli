i agree with the given statement because in my opinion young people do not give enough time to helping their community . nowadays young people spend their leisure time with playing video game or watching television . they are surfing the internet and are putting on weight . only a few child go outside to play with friend or do team sport . nowadays most of the child are overweighted . they do not learn that there are other people with need , opinion and feeling , too , which have to be respected just like they want their need , opinion and feeling to be respected . unfortunately many child only care for themselves and they are not interested in the opinion or feeling of other person . they do thing only for their own advantage and most of them think that it is absolutely unnessesary to help or care for other people . maybe parent should give their child a pet so that the child can learn under the advice of their parent how to take responsibility for another living creature . i guess that helping their community would show them that they are not alone on earth and that it can be very satisfactory to know that you do something because it help another person . in every community are several people that could use some help and there are not enough people who can provide this help . young people could visit old people in retirement home for example . they could take the old people for a walk or talk to them or play card game for example . in a retirement home is not enough staff to care for each of the old people like they would like to . for the young people it would not be much work . they would only have to spend a little time with them . it would make the old people happier and this way the young people would do somthing to help their community .
