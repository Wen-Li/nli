the goal of an advertisement is the increase of a product 's sale and the company 's profit . it therefore seems a given that the item of sale is presented a positively a possible . not all prodcuts , however , can live up to the promise they make . bank loan , for example : very low interest rate and easy pay-back mean give the impression of fast money without much hassle and very little responsibility for the customer . rather hidden are tricky issue such a security or initial down payment , which have to be provided on a standard basis . the focus of the add doe not disclose the actual cost of such loan . therefore , a viewer can easily be led to believe that lending money from the bank is quite inexpensive , whereas she or he may in fact be running up a huge amount of debt when all aspect of loan taking are considered . in particular , the math between income , basic living expense and cost for a loan , are usually very revealing . another illusion that advertisement reinforces is that of look . research regularly show that particularly young woman feel pressurized by the appearance of person in ad . a recent study found that even woman who work in the advertisement industry and who know of the unhealthy lifestyle of most of the female model a well a the use of computer technique such a photo-shop , believe that their body are not the way the should be . one area where the claim of the ad and reality appear to be more balanced is medication : mandatory guidlines on dozage and recommended consultation with medical doctor seem to convey more caution than many of the `` easy doe it '' and bubbly commercial for general product . finally , something also need to be said about the consumer : while much of the responsibility for creating illusion obviously vest with the advertising industry , the consumer should also be held to a certain standard of scepticism and critical review .
