in my opinion , the appropriatness of traveling in a group led by a tour guide depends on the nature of the person and the place to be travelled . for an enthusiast like me , the schedule of a group travel will be very binding and i wo n't be able to enjoy a much . but for elderly people and people with kid , it will be more enjoyble if everything is taken care of by a tour guide . but in some circumstance , tour group becomes very essential . for example , if i am travelling in a foreign country and i do n't know their language , i will prefer travelling in a tour group . by doing that , i will save the pain of ordering wrong thing on the menu , and more importantly , i wo n't keep loosing my way because of sign board written in a foreign language . also , if i am travelling to a place of historical importance , i would like to be led by a tour guide who can give me more information about that place . in situation , when i have very little time on hand and there are lot of place to see , i think i will be better off a a part of a tour group . or else , i 'll waste most of my time , finding and reaching all the tourist spot on my own . on the other hand , if i am going on an adventure trip for camping and trekking , tour group will be the last thing on my mind . also , if i am on a spiritual or relaxing trip , to a calm place with not many thing to explore , the tour group will not be very useful . i feel tour group led by tour guide are important , but it depends on traveller discreation to decide if it is the best way to travel . as a conclusion , i would like to state that i do not agree with the given statement .
