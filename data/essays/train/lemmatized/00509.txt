we are living in a consumption world . in such a buy-consume-rebuy world advertisement constitutes a great part of our life even though we are not aware of it . have you ever watched a match or a series in tv or walked to your local market without seeing any advertisement ? i guess your answer is no . many of these advertisement are showing u how their product is really nice and high quality . do you think are they honest ? my point of view is that most of these advertisement make product seem much better than they originally are because of the competition both in the market and between the advertisement company . the first reason why most advertisement show product better than they really are is that there are many company that are selling the same product . therefore , there is too much competition in the market . to be able to compete with other firm and stay in the market , company spend unbelievable amount of money in advertisement and show their product a the ` best ' product that is in sale . as an instance , in my country a candy brand called ulker made an advertisement in which there wa a quote saying that `` you can forget it name , but never it taste . '' when i ate this candy , i saw no difference in it taste than any other brand ' candy . secondly , besides the competition between company that spend money to these advertisement , there is also competition between advertisement company . to make their advertisement liked by the company that hire them they should prepare the advertisement such that they will persuade the company worker that this product will be sold . therefore , most of the time advertisement company are exaggerating the feature or the quality of the product in order to be liked by the product owner and be hired again in the next time . all in all , because of the competition between company that are producing the product and the company that are making the advertisement , most of the time the product advertised are shown a better than they really are . thus , consumer should be careful about those advertisement and should not rely on them .
