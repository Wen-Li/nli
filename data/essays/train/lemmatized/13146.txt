yes i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject . is important because none can go up without basic knowledge also no one can reach to higher step without first foundation step . so that , to specialize in one subject is easy key towards the success . for example child can not allow to sit directly in higher class he has to go throge certain normsunder educational level so he should start from his first standered class only . furthermore , from getting or gattering datta from differnt subject helps student in acqisition information about subject in which he want to specialized also become more practical in subject . because when you are going through the subject your basic knowledge should be powerful with explanation with stratagiesand skill should be appropiateto the your conclusion that makes you perfect in your specialization subject . the main ida you will get from oter subject only because without that how your thesis get comlete with better complement . so your idea should be clear with good examples and more understandig words . so i prefer that we all should study different subject for more knowledge and more information which sustain our project work more precisely . so it all comes rom oter subject knowledge which improve our intellectual thinkin
