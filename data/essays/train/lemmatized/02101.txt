in my opinion , i feel that the opinion is preferable that understanding idea and concept are more significant than learning fact for student because of several reason . first , it would not be interesting to learn fact too much . by teaching for student idea and concept , the student would be getting interested in the subject which is fact more . for example , for my case , i did not like biology because it seems so difficult for me . when i read about biological textbook , i gave up reading soon after i started to read the book . however , during the biology class , my biology teacher showed u familiar example and some idea and concept . after the class , i could read the textbook once i gave up before without thinking that it is difficult . it wa quite interesting . because of the teacher , now i like biology and in the future i would like to get job that is related to biology . due to this case occured for me before , i think it is more important to understand them rather than to learn fact . second , it is going to be very debatable if the student received an education about idea and concept more than fact . it mean that both the teacher and the student enjoy the class because the student would suggest many opinion against the idea and concept . i think it encourages the teacher to teach something . it is because if the teacher teach fact too much and do n't teach concept , the student would not be able to understand about fact , and they would not pay attention about the topic . for teacher , it should be avoidable thing . third , the process to understand idea and concept are quite significant than understanding fact . it let student to think about something , so they can state their own opinion . it is really important to have your own opinion today 's world , so i agree the idea . facts are important too , but you ca n't actually learn without understanding idea and concept for anything .
