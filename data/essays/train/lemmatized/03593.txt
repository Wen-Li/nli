most of u feel overwhelmed by advertisement every day . we see it everywhere in town , even along the highway . many people do not like it because it seems penetrant and unhonest to them . but is it really trying only to fool consumer ? advertisement is information , first of all , it informs u about a new product . and it is a comfort and easy way to get to know what 's new on the market . and no one can force anybody to buy the thing . in many country there are rule for company - they are not allowed to advertize something by lying about it . but it is evident that limit are not clear , when doe suggestion end and lying start ? if a perfume company engages a model to tell the consumer that she or he feel attractive and irresistable by using the perfume this might be true . there is no guarantee that the consumer will feel the same but it is suggested . advertisment want to attract people by promising them a great and wonderful product that will change their life . rationally thought it is clear that not every new hamburger , perfume or shaver will change our life . but advertisement try to attract the inconscient part of the brain . we often do not think about it rationally and long time . many company promise the potential consumer to fulfil their deepest wish - if they just buy the product they will be beautiful , intelligent and loved . i think that most advertisement definitely make product seem better than they really are and i think that many or most of the suggestion made by advertisement can not be fulfilled . so it is necessary to handle advertisemant with a certain attention and prudency . i also like being informed about new product but it is essential to think about it real use . of course company try to influence people only because they want to make profit but on the other hand it 's the people 's decision to buy their product or not .
