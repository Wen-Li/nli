i do n't think young people enoy life than older people do . it seem to be so , because younger people are energic and spirited than elder people , and the range of action they can do are wider than elder . that 's why elder people say `` the yourth enjoy their lif than u . '' however , i doubt young people is more enjoyed their life than elder people ? the first reason is that the the yourth impossible to escape from comming across the lot of ploblems . the ploblems are may be about friend , parent , future , and oneselfs . they do n't know how to handle them . they have to think over about ploblems , and expelience difficult situtation , and spend hardtime . and then , they finaly find the way of solution by oneself . this process need for growing to adult . and then , when they mature enough , they finally know how to enjoy the life accutually . sometimes , the yourth enjoying themselves mean ecaping from uneasy . so it 's not real enjoy . just discourse . and there is also money aspect . for exsample , i love music very much , and also desire to go the gig of the favorite artist . however when i wa high school student , i never go the gig , just because id did n't have enough money . but after entering university , i started to work a a ppirt time , and finaly could go the gig . that wa wonderful expeliene . but still now , the time i could go the gig is limited . because the capital is shortage . my friend who is already work a full-part time can go the gig whenever she want . so thai think elder people well know the solution way of difficults they encounter by expelience and have well finance . so , they afford to enjoy their life than the yourth .
