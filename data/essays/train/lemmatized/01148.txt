i agree with the statement that `` it is more important for student to understand ideas and cocepts than it is for them to learn fact '' because understanding give clarity on the issue . understanding a concept or an idea will help the student in better implementation . when a problem occurs during the implementation of concept , it is important that student know exactly where to look . this calrity can be attained only by understanding the concept and not by merely learning it . for example , when a student after his graduation join a software technology firm a a fresher , he is relatively new to the real world . when asked to work on a project , he would feel comfortable with it if he understands the topic . and in the middle stage of implementation , if a problem ha occured he will know exactly where to look for . learning fact will not help in understanding complex task . there is a danger of gettting stuck , unable to find answer . and also , understanding concept and idea help in learnig complex task related to the topic . for example , a student who ha learned c language in college might find it difficult to learn java . but , a student who understands the concept of c language will find it easy to understand java even though he might not have taken c language a a course in college . after all basic are the foundation for healthy higher learning . this phenomenon can be witnesse from the college level also . a student who is well versed in the basic concept of high school education ha a higher chance of making it to the college than a student who is not . hence i conclude , saying that understanding idea and concept is better for a student than it is to learn them just for the sake of learning .
