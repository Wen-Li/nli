nowadays , in our country we have a huge number of car running on the highway , and it seems that something need to happen to avoid this situation that sometimes becomes problematic . in any case , i do not complety agree with the question . let me explain better , on one hand , we know the importance that the transnational company car have for the economy . the motor industry is one of the most important industry in the world . so , i suggest that it is impossible to stop the production of the car , without affecting other field , or aspect of the economy . and maybe it could have impredecible effect . i am not considering the economy a the most important thing , this is not my aim , but unfortunatelly , we have to think on this fact , because we need to have good economy to avoid conflict in the future . on the other hand , we have new alternative to support the impact that the car have in the planet . in this point , we should speak about car that use other kind of energy and more or le have the same capacity to move u . these car use gas , or vegetal oil . we have to ass this point to achieve that the idea of individual freedom remains . in conclusion , in my opinion it is early to know if in the future there will be more or few car in the planet , because it is not easy to answer this question . usually the people seem to think just in the negative aspect of the car , forgetting the possitive point of view . i mean , we have to consider that the car is one important aspect of our common life , and not just for enjoying , but for working or travelling . i try to explain that , apart from considering the number of car , we have to know if it will exist the possibility for avoding the damage that the car do in the enviroment . i think that the people will create a new kind of car on this goal , for the future . i hope so .
