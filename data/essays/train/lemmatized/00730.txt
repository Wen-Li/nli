in general it is always difficult to decide definitely for one possibility . because both of them contain some advantage but also some disadvantage , it would be the best to decide for a mixture . whereas a broad knowledge of many subject refers to the ideal of humanism which ha been supported for a long time and partially is still being supported , specialization is a phenomenon of modern time . we are living in a time of change . scientific and technical progress have coined the last century more than any time before . with the term `` globalization '' i only want to mention one of the new challenge we have to master . as a reaction on these change the idea of specialization ha developped . today , there is much more discovered than in former time so you even have to learn much more to get along in a certain profession or academical direction . as a result specialization is definitely necessary . nevertheless i regard a certain broad knowledge to be absolutely necessary for everyone . our world is so complex and also complicated that people have to know the essential thing about almost all subject to give an reliable feedback for example to politician leading a nation . if people are not a well educated there will be the risk of creating a society leaded by a few people not thinking about entire people 's problem . so i would prefer a mixture of generalized and specialized knowledge . all people should learn the most important element out of all academic subject . in school there is the possibility to do so . later they might decide to be teached in one subject and in subject related to this chosen one . after that , people may really specialize in their subject . by this way it would take a longer time until people start working but it surely would be an advantage for society .
