in my opinion the statement is true that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . to confirm my opinion i will give several example . for example if you think of a product filled in bag like soup and then of a commercial in television . the soup look colorfull and it seems that many thing are in it . but if you will buy it and cook it on your own at home there are not a much noodle in it a the commercial want to make people believe . this happens on an special purpose . advertisements are made to sell something to people . people who make advertisement are specially trained to know what people want to have , so they will only show u the thing we want to see . in my example this are more noodle in the soup then there actually are . another example is advertisement for underwear on large poster everywhere outside . on these poster you can see beautifull men and woman , and the underwear fit them perfectly . the inventers of such advertisement did this perfect thing to make people think that they can look like these people too if they will buy the product . so it is all about what buyer want to see and feel when they look at advertisement . the maker of advertisement mostly pretend to have the best and perfect product and to convince buyer to believe so too , they exagerate in demonstrating good item a perfect item . no one want to spend his or her money on thing that are not worth it , but they also have to believe in advertisement .
