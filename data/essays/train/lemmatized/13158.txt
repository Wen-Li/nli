i think it depends on the age of the student . for young student , like secondary and high school it will be more important to to know about idea and concept . students at this age still at beginning stage or we can say learning state . they have learn much more theory to support their opinion in the future . even they may learn from what happening in the history . by learning theory , student will think about what will happened in the application of the theory . while the older student , at university for example , have to learn more the fact . they may create new idea or concept from the fact they get . without idea or concept , student will not know whether it is right or not . older student should apply the theory they get in real life . then , by knowing the result , the new idea or concept will come again and create new result . this will be worthfull experience for stude for example , they are two kind of cost in production , fix and variable cost . fix cost should not be change at any sum of production . but when we increase or quantity any certain level , the fix cost will change . thus , idea or concept and fact support each other . learning from the fact will not be useful without knowing the idea or concept . because some of the fact may be come from idea or concept . the plane can fly is the fact . how the plane can fly came from the concept of researcher in their good calculation when making the plane .
