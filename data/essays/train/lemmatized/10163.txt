as everyone konws travelling is a thing full of fun . by the acient time we have lot of traveller who traveled to the peopleless place and wrote down many liberty for the following people . one of my dream used to be a traveller some day and travel all over the world . but , will travelling in a group led by a tour guide really good ? i do n't think so . the most important thing for travelling is discovering . as everyone 's childhood , what i wanted to do is to go further from our house , discover my `` new world '' . this is also the reason for why i want to be a traveller . if you travel with a group led by a guide , it will lose lot of fun . the guide will tell you everything he or she know about the place . this can make me crazy . you can discover nothing . just like you are drinking water but you feel you are still thirsty . so that 's why i do n't like travel with a group led by a guide . the second important thing is being along . most people want to travel just because they want to have a rest . as the pace of our life is getting faster and faster , we need more and more relax . traveling with a group could never make you relax . the guide will take you everywhere . if you are in the group you may get tired for the whole trip . that 's why most of the people in the group sleeping on the way , take photo at the sightseeing and forget everything when they get back . the third and the last thing is , we need free . people are getting could n't stand about sleeping in cage like apartment everyday . what they need is free . travelling by oneself , you can go anywhere whenever you want . so if you travel with a group led by a guide . what you do is just like walking after a leader and walk , walk , and walk . in conclusion , travelling in a group led by a tour guide will make no sense . you may lose all the fun of the trip . somehow , that may equal to a waist of time . so , just try to travel by yourself .
