when it come to the question of whether it is important for student to understand idea and concept or for the student to learn fact , different people might have totally different answer to the question . in my view , it is more important for the student to learn fact . the reason go a fellow . first of all , the fact are about experience . to learn the fact can make the study more practical . considering that if a student just learn the idea and the concept in his or her study , he or she just know what it is because the concept told him or her . however , he or she may not understand how to use it or what it is for to learn such thing . the problem is that they did not related the idea and concept to fact . they should learn to analysis fact use the learning of concept , making their study more practical . in addition , it is more usefl for the student to learn fact . as we know , the purpose for people to study idea and concept is to use it and make contribution to our life . our life consist many of fact , and we need to study the fact and make them useful to u . if we just study idea and concept , it mean nothing to our scociety . the idea and concept are just the basis of fact . it is ture that we need to learn the idea and concept first and then we can learn and understand the fact better . it is also true that leaning idea and concept is the basis thing for u to practice our knowledge . i also admit that idea and concept play important role in human study . however , in comparision with the importance to fianlly get used to our life , fact is more important . in conclusion , based on the resons i discussed above , even though others may have totally different opinoins with me , i still belive that fact is more important .
