nowadays , most of young people do n't know what misery is . i 'm talking about country like france , usa or germany , and so on . country that are rich . when you have evrything you need , you can not imagine that you could help people who will love to have your help . i agree that nowadays , young people do not give enough time to helping their comminuties . but this is not true only for young people . nowadays , in our society , everyone think about him before someone else . it 's called ` selfish ' . and i definitivelly can not agree with this because even if we have the chance to leave in a ritch country , poorety exist . young people and also adult have to pay attention to their community . but if we want young people to help , adult have to show the example . we must have bunch of people who help each other because this is so much easier to live this way . first , when you help someone , you bring him so much happiness that he will feel much better quicly , and you give yourself a good satisfaction by doing it . but the man , or woman you did help will do it for someone else . and this other person for another , and so on . by the way , if you think about this , by helping each other , this is all the society who will feel better , and if there are more people doing this , after a while , le people will need help . i know it 's not possible to solve enyone problem , but it 's a dream who can become true . there are 6 billon people on earth , so is it better to have 6 billion people who do n't care except thereself , ot is it better to have 6 billion people who are a crew . i will finish like this . even if it 's look like enoying to help someone , what you feel inside by doing that is the best reward you can ever have . young people need to mouve and care for their community , because without a community , human is nothing .
