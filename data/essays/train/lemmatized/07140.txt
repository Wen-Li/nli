nowadays it may seem at first sight , watching the daily news about the terrible , careless and lazy youth , that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . in my opinion this statement doe not show how reality really look like . of course there are young people who do n't do anything for their community , but there are still a lot of young , intelligent and involved people who show their best leadership and invest hard work into supporting and helping their community on a volunteer base . the cause of the statement shown above might be the always existing and never ending generation conflict that reflames in every country and in every century . but young people do help their community these day too . for example at my university there are a lot of possibility for student to get involved in community service a a volunteer . of course not every student get involved with community work but most of my friend do . let me give some certain example : there is a law club that give legal adive to people who can not afford a lawyer . the people who come there do not have enough money to pay a normal lawyer , so the student organised a club where they help people to find legal advice , but do not take any money for it . ( this happens in poland , in germany it is forbidden ) . another student club take care for the environment , another teach little child to speak foreign language , and another help unemployed people to organise a company or firm and take the first legal and economic step to it by developing business plan . a lot of student get involved in their ` international ' community a well , joining amnesty international for instance and fighting for human right through organising different action like writing letter to different government , governements who are violating human right . some of my friend get involved socially . they go to school and do a social year in their own country or in foreign country for example . ina , a friend of mine , did that in a middle school for handicaped child in cologne . she wa helping out there a a volunteer , and did not get any benefit from it ( except her personal experience of course ) . another example is that young men help out a a ` zivi ' between their graduation from high school and study at a university or other jobtraining , to avoid going to the army for one year . the most common is for them to help out in hospital or home for older people . and they do n't just do it to avoid the army . some of them , a my friend for example , stay longer at the institution . there are far more example of how student and other young people get involved in helping their community . they do care , no matter what adult or older people might say and how bad the generation conflict might get . it prof that the young people nowadays are not a careless a one might think .
