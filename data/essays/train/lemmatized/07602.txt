there is a great range of opinons about whether people agree with this statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . some people might agree with this statement and other people might disagree with this statement . as far a i am concerned , i disagree with this statement because many people can achieve their success by not taking risk and improving what is well-known . i like to focus on these reason in more detail . the first and primary reason for my belief is that many people can achieve their success by avoiding risk . for example , if people can learn a lot of information from other 's failure , they might be successful without taking risk . to give my family 's example , when my grandfather started new business in any field , he always reseached about the failure example conducted by other people because failture example taught him why these business were not successful . he wa so prudent that he could make his success without taking any risk . this example show that people can be successful not by taking risk but by avoiding risk . that is why i disagree with this statement . another reason why i disagree with this statement is that people also can be successful not by trying newthings but by improving what is well-known . one example that come to mind quickly is the japanese internet shopping site , so-called rakten . this internet site always did not provide new technology and method to customer . however , this company wa always thinking about how to attract their cuctomers and make customer buy easily . then it improved their site constantly . finally , this company dominated internet shopping site without introduing new technology . i think this example show people can be successful without trying new thing . considering all these fact i mentioned above , there is no doubt that i disagree with this statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . of course , i can not deny that many successful people tried new thing and took risk . for example , sony , a famous global company in japan , always tried new thing and provied new electric appliance , such a portable radio and video game . however , i still disagree with this statement because many people can achieve their success by avoiding risk and improving what is well-know .
