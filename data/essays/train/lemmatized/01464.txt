having a broad knowledge of many academic subject without a specific specialization would give one information that is excessive , irrelevant , desultory in nature if it ha to be applied to one 's vocation , service , a profession . so i would disagree with the pursuit of many field of study without any subject to specialize in . for example , if a student of engineering pursues course in performing art , like dance , it might enhance the talent and social value of the person but it would not contribute to his performance in his role a an academician or a professional a an engineer . each subject ha many specialization within it field . education in itself is expensive . compared to the working population , for various reason , a relatively smaller percentage of people pursue education after high school , earn a baccalaureate degree and then begin , complete graduate school also . for example , psychology ha other sub-fields of clinical , counseling , education which serve different purpose in helping the recipient of it service . or let 's take the example of a doctor who ha taken course in various subject rather than emphasizing his learning in surgery , or medicine , or cancer . how can he/she help patient to get well with a broad knowledge that cover subject of political science , medicine , english etc . ? if the school of higher learning do not build their department around a particular subject , for example , social work or social policy ; the administration , teaching , evaluation the course being taught would suffer seriously . till secondary school level , many academic subject can be learnt and it is good for our general knowledge . but a the focus of education shift to college and university , it make sense intellectually , practically , knowledge-wise to specialize in one specific subject . this would help people to fulfil various role , perform the service required to have a functional society . the society , it educational , social and health system would be in chaos in the event of a scenario where education would lack focus , training , depth in every particular field of study .
