in my point of view , people should try for new thing rather than doing the old thing repetedly . because sucess full thing lead to do many new thing that are use full for man kind . peole who are in research field they use to invent new thing that are use full for man kind , for example in the field of medical and space research . in the medical field there are so many disease to be known and they should be cured . for example cancer & aid etc , researcher are doing continious invenctions how to find the new medicans that can cure 100 percent a man . so there should be some new thing to do reaserch that it can be cured in some other way . comming to the electrical and mechanical thing without taking risk , how people can invent the bulb and rotatory eqipements . so there should be some new thing which thing lead to change in history . but , a part from inventing new thing there should be some updations what thay have earlier invented . for example computer wa first invented by abuscus and the mechine wa also prety large and heavy . but comming to the present computer have designed in a fashion that a man can carry from place to place without any need of help or with out any assistance . so there should be also a continous up gariation when some thing is inventd to make it ussage simple day by day . so , from the above point of explantion it can be said that people should invent to new thing a well a old thing . there shold be some manner of processure to do the thing in a sucessfull manner . the thing that are invented should support the environment it shold not distrub the man kind . and there shold be and regulary updation of the thing that heve been invented and should be cheked wether it is in a proper condition or not
