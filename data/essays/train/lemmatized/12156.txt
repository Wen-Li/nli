we can always hearing people saying that life of some old people are become more and colorful , even more that some of their grandchild . this is true . however , bacically , it is no doubt that the old people can enjoy le fun than the young , we can just deduce it by looking the old people around u . first of all , a geting older , it is inevitable for the older to have more problem on thier health . so they can not doing what they what equally a the young , they can hardly play football dancing the hip-hop , or even just ride a bike around the park . moreover with the decay of vitality , the older people do n't even to do such kind of thing , which in my opinion is obviously the happiness that life ha offer . second , the young are not only physically stronger than the older , but they are more open-minded and have curiosity to try something new . the joy and satisfaction that one can get should never be underestimated . thirdly , a for the older people , one alligation often made is that they do have much more sparetime , to do whatever they like . they can spend the whole day sitting beside the river bank waiting for some ignorant poor fish to eat their bite , or take care of their plant and vegetable in the garden . but i my mind , this is only one kind of enjoyment , which can not compare with those what the young have when they achieve great accomplishment . althoght it would be hard for a scientist to discover a new theory , or for a business man to make their company larger and more well-known , yet the satifaciton thereafter are an not be underestimated . althought it is hard for some older to accepte that fact that they can enjoy le enjoyment , yet they have to facing to reality .
