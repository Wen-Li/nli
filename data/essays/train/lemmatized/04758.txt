i agree with those who believe that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their community , for the following reason : in my town there a lot of helping centre , many young guy take part to activity for disadvantage people and i am an example of young boy who help someone else . first of all , in my country there are fifty ( more or le ) association that are pawned in social aspect , like drug or child sick , that look for young people to learn the meaning of helping other and want to insert them in these community . for example the abio association , which deal with child with great disease , ha got a specif group of teenager from 16 to 19 year old that three day a week go to the hospital and they take care child or they organize something of amusement for them . furthermore in many school of my town , guy , who help others , meet the student in a conference to tell them their experience and how helping community his enjoyable for their soul . i took part in one of this conference and i remembered an episod . one of these guy showed u some photograph of child who lived in africa . they were very ill , most of them died at the early age of 5-6 year . during this demonstration a big silent fell in the room and everyone made a reflection about what he or she ha just saw . i wa 17 year old , and from that moment i understood that in the world there are a lot of disadvantage child that should live a moment of happiness in their life . so i made a decision and now i am one of the numerosous young people that two or three time a week dedicate their free time to make a smile in which child who are suffering for a terrible disease . to sum up , i think that every guy should look in your heart and should prove to help the others . if it is necessary i will enjoy to teach it them when i will be qualified a the boy that i met .
