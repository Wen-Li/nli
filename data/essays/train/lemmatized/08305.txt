some people believe that to disminish air pollution there will be some effort to reduce the use of car . so that in twenty year fewer car will be seen in road and city . as far a i am concerned i desagree with them for several reason . the first reason i do not believe that in the future there will be le car than today is that in our world and way of life , car are used everyday and have become necessary object for year , like computer are today . it is true that if you live in a big city you can avoid to take your car to go to work , because there is enough common transportation , like subway or bus , but how many worker use it ? i think that if everybody take the subway or bus there will be no place at all to breath . in addition it will be not enough bus to transport all the people . and then if you live in countryside there is not often good common transportation so you must take your car to go to work or even go to the supermarket . the second one is that today goverments all around the world are not agree on this subject . in fact there is a strongh difference between devolopped country and those who are in developping . the latest need more and more car because their economy is increased so there are more and more people who come in city to find job . in contrary , in the usa or in france for example car firm are looking for new energy in order to avoid the global warning to increase , but noone seems to think about reduce the number of car . the latest reason but not the least i thing there will not fewer car is to do this , goverments and politics have to make agrrement for that . i mean give more money to city in order to allow them to built more line of subway , more road specific for bus and built more car parking around the city so that people who do not live in the city can parked their car an then take the suibway . to conclude i thing that to decrease the number of car in the world , we have to improve common transportation and their access because today too much people do not have the possibility to take it .
