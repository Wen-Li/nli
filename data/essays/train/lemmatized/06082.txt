nowadays , student are leading to learn more theory , but have a lack of knowledge of the real fact . in my opinion , i do n't think it is more important to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact . to prove my opinion , i have three reason . first of all , we all livein the real world , everyday we see grass , flower , tree , bird , etc. they are all the creature , we can touch , smell , and hear . students should be taught how to admire these real thing ( fact ) in our daily life , the idea and concept can not help student to learn more about the creature . second of all , most of the idea and concept are in the book , if student are just studing thesis idea and concept , than they will lose many chance to be in touch with nature . in contrast , nature may help child find more idea and concept than in the book throughout the practice in the outside . last but not the leat , the idea and concept are the result from the scientist or the phylogists , they may get these idea and concept in wrong way . according to today 's registration , many new and correct idea and concept are out . but in student ' book , the idea and concept do n't be improved , so student may get the wrong information about the fact . then , at this time , experiment is much more important , let student get correct idea and concept by themselves . for example , physic and chemistry can not lust learn the idea and concept , student must have a objective configuration of the physical and chemical fact . to sum up , the nature , the practice , and the experiment are the better mean for student to get idea and concept of the fact . in these way , they can not only learn the truth in the book , but also learn more about fact throuth the process of getting knowlege .
