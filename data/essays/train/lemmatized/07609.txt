well i agree with the statement . young poople do actually enjoy life more than older people . its important here to define what one mean by `` enjoyment '' . if one mean that enjoyment mean having your dream car , more money to spend , going to late naight party and club , then yes youth are indeed at an advantage because they have the youthfull energy and charisma and are not prone to health problem a older people are usually prone to . but if one defines enjoyment a having peace of mind , relaxation and trouble free life then there cant be happier retired person whose son stay with him and who ha all the time in the world to play with his 1 yr old grandson . young people have the advantage of flexibility . they can adapt to a new situation more easily than old people who usually become reserved with age . if you have to shift from one city to another , a a youth you will be able to adjust very easily to the new city and start enjoying your life but a an oldie you wont be able to come to the term of the new city and make new friend easily . the most important factor is of health . old age often brings many disease along with it . and a one grow old he 's bound to have one or the another disease . this health factor also contributes a lot to the fact that older people dont enjoy much because even if they are youthful at heart , they cant be physically because their health wont permit . science and technology have become internal part of our life . every day there are new gadget to be found in the nearby store and very quickly they make way into our home . internet ha shrinked the world but the it the youth that are making the most use of it . todays youth is more technically inclined and he know how to make the best use of the technolgy that is being discovered and enjoys it to it fullest . the problem with older people is that they are not that much technically inclined and a a consequence are not inclined towards such gadget which would make there life more enjoyable .
