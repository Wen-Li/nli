i am a young person and i agree with this statement . i thing we do not give enough time to helping our community . in fact we do not give enough time a lot of thing . for example we do not read enough or we do not go to cinema and theatre enough . we spent huge time for internet chat and computer game . .. etc . and i thing chat and computer game are very unnecessary thing . but unfortunately chat and computer game have commoned very easy and fastly . i thing we correct this situation shortly time . if we do not correct this situation our young people will give up helping their community . for example using the telephone ha decreased since the internet commonly . young people chat with they do not know everyone . and they do not know that they are lier . also young people do not give enough time our friend . we choose play computer game or chat . so our friend is decrease . finally i think we are giving enough time to helping our community .
