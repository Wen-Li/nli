` community ' is the sole of any civilization . the stronger the community is the better would be the civilization . since community consructs the society and socity ha a big impact on the life style of the people living in the society and the literature written , and all these thing reflect the progress and prosperity of the nation . as far a the role of young people in the developmant of the society or community is concern , i am completely agree with the fact that young people are not paying much attention towards their society now day . young people act a the base for any society because thay have the energy and courage . they are the flag carry of their community . any commuinity is reflected by it younger generation . but now day young people are not understanding their duty towards their community and their nation . people are geeting more and more self centred and this selfishness is leading them towards this . people should realize that it only the community that is going to help them . one can not live in isolation . let u take a example to explain this point . suppose if we isolate a person from a community then would the person will servive ? the answer is definitely negative . one can not survive without an environment . the person is dependent on the community for his basic need . all the function of a community are inter-dependent . one can not perform all the fuctions alone . so here the youth need to understant the fact that they can not survive without a society . secondly , if you are living in an environment then there would be a proper balance between you and the environment . your environment must be a developed one in the same way a you are . to explain this point let u take the example of a tree surrounded by a dirty land then definetly that dirty surroundings are going to hinder the growth of the tree . so we must learn here the importance of community and it development . nowdays youth are not contributing towards the development of their community . they must reallize the fact that development can not be made alone . you wo n't be cosidered a the developed person until unless you belong to a developed nation . so in conclusion of my view i would like to state that young people , including me a well , should reallize their duty towards their community and should come forward to uplift it . i would like to urge them to work for the prosperity and development of their community .
