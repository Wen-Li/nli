you did your reseach and chose a very good tour . you brought your map , your back pack , your camera and some candy for the trip . you expect to cover every single city that the program includes . sounds great ! ... but you just found out ( already on the bus , train , whatever ) that you have 30 min to spend in each place , and you start to think that it is not what you expected . .. well , that is what commonly happens when you travel in a group , with a tour guide ( policeman ) , checking on you every step of the way , fixing your schedule , telling you not to roam to far and sometimes even telling you what to eat . traveling in a group mean that you are part of a bunch of people going to every place together , sometimes having to hold conversation that you do n't want to have , and observing a schedule that is not even suitable for you . even though traveling in a group could have good thing , a for example , you can cover a lot of area and place in a specific time , because every thing is scheduled , you should also have to deal with the contraints of it , that commonly get traduced to frustration and that sense of `` not enough time '' in certain place , museum , city of even a sidewalk . for u that like to have more time to spend freely while traveling , and being open for the espontaneus stuff , it is certainly not the way to go ! i prefer to travel by myself , in order to have the liberty to decide what i would like to do in a specific moment . if a would like to stay for one more day in a specific city i can just ask myself ( and my wallet ) to receive an answer and that 's all . in conlcusion , i believe that if you want to visit a lot of place in a short period of time , and have somebody to control your agenda , traveling in a group is for you . but if you want to have a more local perspective of place , and the opportunity to decide in the moment wether what to do , stay away from the traveling group !
