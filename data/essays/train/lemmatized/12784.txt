i agree to the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . eventhough it is also important to learn fact , it is more valueable to get the idea or concept of everything for several reason . first of all , it is easy to know fact everytime after you get older . in contrast , it is harder to understand the concept of some fundamental thing . ideas and concept should be obtained in your young age to contract the right way of thinking . for example there is quite a lot of low that constrain people 's behavior such a that people can not kill the other people . it is quite easy to know the fact , but the most important thing a person should know is why there are such low and understand correctly the concept of them . secondly , the important thing for people is to apply the idea to the other situation . even if you learned fact , it is worhless unless you understand the concept behind the fact . for an instance , you learn a new formula in math class . the formula is a `` fact '' in this case . you can solve a simple question using it , however , it is hard to solve difficult or complicated question for you if you do n't understand the basic idea of the formula . in the real world , people will meet several difficult problem . to solve them , people need to apply what they learned into the completely different situation . the fact will not help them at that time . therefore i recommend student to understand the idea or the concept than to acknowledge only the fact .
