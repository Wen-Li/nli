i completely agree with this statement . it cost a lot of money to have a car especially in japan . people will find that there is no deal to use car a transportation . this considerable reason are cost , and other way of transportation . it is expensive to charge gasoline , because of decreasing . the place where we can get gasoline is now the stage of the war . i have read that there will be no energy fifty year later . not only that it is expensive , but also people are afraid of their future life without energy power , so am i . there are many kind of public transportation around u such a bus , train , and air plane . it save gasoline not to use private car . it cost about sixty dollar for a car filled up gu . on the other hand , it cost about two hundred dollar to get an air plane ticket , then we can go abroad . in addition , there are so many advantage to use public transportation . therefore , people do not have to rely on their own car . in conclution , there will be fewer car in use than there are today , because people will not be able to pay the expense , and there are other useful foot in our life . moreover , we can say that the le people to support riding own car , the better reaction to the earth . it mean that it is good for environment a well . i think there are too much car around u .
