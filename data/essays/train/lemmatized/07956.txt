some people think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , i disagree , i think there will be more car a car are very succesful investment , it is very important way of transportation , and it is a wonderful tool to enjoy your life . first of all , car are succesful investment , every one know well that these factory that producing car earn million of dollar every year , these factory are in great competition with each others they do their best in order to produce unique , stylish car in order to sell more and more car and so earn more money , every year we find hundred of new model from different country , such a competetion is increasing every day and so car increasing also . another imporatant point is that car is considered a one of the most imporant transportation , if you have your own car you could go to any place at any time taking your family member with you and it only cost you the price of gasoline , such a job would be so diffecult if you decide to use another way of transportation such a bus , taxi or train , it would cost you more time , money and more effort , a a result car is considered a essential need nowadays and so it `` s number is markedly increasing . in addition to have a car mean you could enjoy your time , you could out together with your friend and go to any interesting or exciting place . you could make a tour on your city , you can visit your friend whose house are far away from yours , a car s are considered a a way of entertainment , it become a comon gift at these day , i cant deny that the most important gift i have ever received is the car i received from my father at my graduation day . i think in twenty year there will be more car in use a factory produce more and more car in order to earn more money , and a our need of car is markedly increase either a a good way of transportation , or a a gift .
