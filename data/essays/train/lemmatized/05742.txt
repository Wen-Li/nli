some pupil often claim about the fact that they have to learn so much fact on thing that they are not really interested in . but this problem is sometimes only based on the thing that pupil just have not understood the idea of the theme . therefore i think it is more important for pupil a well a for student to get clear with the idea and how these idea are developed than just to learn about the fact . i agree that theory is important but all the other thing should be then strengthen by practising . the most important argument is that without having understand the idea or the concept of the special topic that is being worked on in class it is just useless for the student to learn the fact based on the topic . in a certain test the student may can list all the fact that he ha learned but doe absolutely not understand in what context they are . secondly , i think it is more important that the student learn about the theory in the lesson and than practice it in the world . if there is for instance a student of medicine who ha always learned very carefully all the factor that have something to do with anatomy it is the best way to strengthen his skill by giving him the opportunity to have an exam on a real dead body . lastly , students may just be overwhelmed by all the fact they are supposed to learn and can therefore just forget the real content of the idea . looking behind the facade is very important for a student so that eventually he can really cope with all the factor and of course also the problem connected with this concept . in conclusion it is absolutely more important for a student to understand the idea than to learn the fact , because practise is more important than theory and student should not be overwhelmed by the fact of a certain topic .
