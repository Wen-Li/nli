the world we are living in is a globalized and competitive one , a economy have come closer to each other , producer and consumer are growingly becoming part of one single global market . goods and service can now be offered through out the world with very little barrier and similar technology available to almost every producer . therefore , product are becoming increasingly difficult to be differentiated . in order to differentiate , produce look for the objetive and subjective quality that can make the product unique or distinctive , and then they must communicate these quality to it potential consumer , mainly through advertisement . so every day we face endless promise of how good and special a product can be , some time appealing to the objective quality or the subjective quality , or perhaps a combination of both . i consider this is to be fair right that producer have in order to succeed in this competitive market . the statement that false promise are made by produce is rather unfair , since mostly it refers to the subjective quality of the product . in the end , it will always be the customer choice to purchase the product based on his or her personal preference . lets consider the example of a car advertisement where they first explain the specification of the engine and technical feature . this is are mostly objetive quality , and the producer ha the responsibility of being truthful , actually , false claim are not only illegal but also harmful to the manufacurer long term success . on the other hand , when they explain the subjective element that will make you buy the car , they are appealing to your personal taste , which will be the judge of how good or not the car is , leaving no room for seeming to be what it is not . in conclusion , i must disagree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are , since it is founded on the premise that the advertiser could be liable for difference in judgement on subjetive matter .
