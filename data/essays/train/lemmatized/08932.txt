i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not use enough time to helping their community . i think that it depends on the education and the economic condition which young people and thier community have . first of all , japan , where i live in , ha many volunteer organization which help local community . many young people belong to these organization to help the older people and the handicapped person in their community . in my experience , when i wa university 's student , i belonged to several volunteer organization . the organization wa established by student to help the local community . many young student worked sincerely for there to get satisfactories of their mind . in japan , we can find many volunteer organization founded by young people . in japan , we learned the importance of helping our own community . in this result , many japanese have helped other person and community since child . i think that it depends on the education which they were given whether young people help others or not . secondly , i think that it also depends on the economic condition on their community . especially , in japan , some of area which have much budget on welfare , young people do not help their community very much . in these reasions , the local social organization help their community mainly by using enormous budget on welfare . to help community is the social enterprise in which much of unemployed people work to get money . in such condition , many young people do not need to help thier community . for these reason , i disagree with the statement that young people do not use enough time to helping thier community . i think that it mainly depends on between the education which young people had and the economic condition which their community have .
