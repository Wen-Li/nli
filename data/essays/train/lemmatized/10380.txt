lately a sharp increase in adverisment wa sensed in every part of the us . the majority of advertisment are seen while watching televsion . you can not possibly watch a game or show without being intrupted by two dozen of commercial . indeed most advertisment make product seem much better than they really are . digital imaging and color enhancments ha created product that doe not exist . bussiness owner relay on the diversty of people out there , to sell their product . moreaver they use these fancy adevertisment to trap people into their store . recent inovations in the world of imaging ; made everything possible . also the use of computer to enhance color , and enhance the image or object ; made everything seem fake . for example my sister went out shopping for a dress she saw in a fancy catalog . she wa stunned the real dress did not look anything like the picture in the catalog . another example might be the nice juciy sandwich you see in the commercial ; but never get to see them in real life . simply becasue they are the invetntion of a camera and a cameraman . most businessmen relay on the diversty of people . you might not think that this is the product you ' ve seen the other day . other individual might think the opposite way . people are not the same ; and they precive thing diffrently . other businessmen try to grab the attnetion of the costumer . for example ; i went to change my car 's tier . one store had this big sign `` 4 tiers for $ 99 '' . imediatly i step in ; however the associate informed me that this offer is not for the size i am looking for . a freind later told me that he used four diffrent car , and he could not get the offer .
