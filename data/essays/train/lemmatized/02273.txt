in order to be successful , people use method , in accordance to their personality , problem solving method , and style of life . throughout history , we see people who became successful by simply doing what is done before , or taking the way no one have taken before . to start with , i can say that majority of people try to be successful with using already established method . some have the result which are supposed to be had , some even fails to apply a method , and some had extraordinary result due to various reason . as an example , i can say that sir alex ferguson , scottish manager of manchester united football team , is one of the most success people that i have ever seen during my life . he is having his twentieth season a the manager of the club , and he not only had several achievement a a manager , but also honored by the queen by being given the honorific `` sir '' . i can also state that he is having the same type of managing since the first day a a manager , and never gave exceptations from his rule , his tactic and his managing style . we all witnessed his fight with his squad 's star player , like david beckham and ruud van nistelrooy in order not to make any exceptations . he wa the same when he used to manage the scottish club , whose name i can not remember at the moment , thus , i can say that he is simply doing what he know how to do well . on the other hand , there are also people who had success by trying thing that were never tried before , andd taking risk . for example , austrian psychologist sigmund freud , who is also called father of psychology by some expert , tried a lot of new thing , claimed many new thing about the human psychology , and founded the school of `` psychoanalysis '' . he added new term to the literature of psychology like ; id , ego , superego and defense mechanism . he tried his own method with his client , and certainly wa very successful at that . there are many theory whics have their basis in psychoanalysis , and many theory were constructed in opposite to pschoanalysis . to summarize , i believe that it is the person that becomes successful , no matter what his \ her way is . if he or she ha the strength and put enough effort , there is no reason not to be successful . just have faith in yourself , and and you are half way away to being successful .
