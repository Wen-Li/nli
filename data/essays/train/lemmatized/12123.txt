traveling for me is a important a eating and sleeping . in fact , i would like to travel three time per year if i have the chance but that never happend . in my opinion , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more realibul and more enjouabul esspichally for visiting a new place . therefore , traveling with a group led by a tour guide will be always my choice because that will save my time and money , give me the background information about this new place , and give me the chance to meet and know new people in the group . first of all , since my budget is always law and fixed , traveling with a group is menimize my spending cost . also , i will save time rather than weasting it in seeing bad place or get lost when i want to go to a good place . on the other hand , i will find a time for haunging out by my self on the street because the tour time is limited during the day . another main reason , the tour guide will be the most knwn person about the history , musemus , culture , and food of the people of this country . as a result , i will benefit of listin to these information and add it to my knolwdge . finally , most of the time i like to travel by me self , so , it will be a great chance to meet and know a new people from all over the world and have a new friend and talk about their culturs , in brief , traveling in a groub will be always my choice and i will recomend this way of traveling to my friend and my child in the future .
