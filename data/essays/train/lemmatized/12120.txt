according to the statement , the number of car in use will decrease in the next twenty year . three reason for that decrease can be stated . first of all , it is stated that most of the people in france live in or nearby big city , and work everyday in the city . these people choose to go to work by car . because the traffic is very high every morning and every evenig , some of them start to be fed up with their car and think of other possibility to go to work , such a using the metro or even biking . additionaly , the government insists on the necessity to decrease pollution . since the car is the most polluting travel mean , the government encourages people not to use it by widening the opening time of the metro . indeed , many people use their car because the metro close at midnight , and they are conseauently not able to come back home without using a taxi after that time . because taxi are too expensive , they prefer to use their car . this decision will convince people not to use their car anymore . finally , another reason why people will not use their car a much a they used to is that the average age of the population is increasing . in twenty year from now , most baby-boomers will not be able to drive a car anymore . this will consequently reduce the number of driver and the number of car in use will decrease . as a conclusion , it is obvious that people will still need their car , to travel for example . however , many effort are made by the government and the people to decrease the pollution level , and the easiest way to do so is to reduce the use of car . it seems to me that , in twenty year , fewer car will be in use than there are today .
