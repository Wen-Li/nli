of course , the car is a kind of very important transfer tool . today , we can not go out without one car . however , it ha some problem resulted from using car , like air pollution , traffic jam and so on . so some people said that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . i believe that the car is the essential tool which the number of it can not decrease . first , because car benefit our life a lot . for example , you can not image that the ups employee transfer package on foot . all the recivers of these letter and package would be very painfull . and also all of the airline would be explosed by thousand of people , if we want go to see someone near your city , i think the only way you can choose is by bike or by plane . the problem that car bring i think is the most major reason of some people think it will be fewer in the future . let u see that problem , first it would be the air pollution that is very bad for people 's heathy . and maybe the oil resouses destory is another problem . but these question already be watched by scientist , and they are inventing and discoverying some new `` oil '' . depending on today 's techonlogies , it 's easy to deal . second , the traffic jam is a obvious problem , but some auto designer who i known in some auto company , like benz , bmw , ford , and so on , are developing some new car that fit the city road system . also , the more and more city planner realize this problem .
