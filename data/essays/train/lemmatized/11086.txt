i agree with successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . if you want to be successful , you should try new thing , take risk and be brave . first of all , success come up with trying new thing which have never done before . you should investigate , think about new thing and make your decision step by step . after all of them you should start what you want to do . for example , bill gates left out from university and created microsoft which would be number one in the world . he found a useful program which named windows . people all over the world us it because it is new and it ha no alternative . he is number one because they always do thing never done before secondly , without risk you can not be success . ' life equal to risk ' say rahmi koc who is the head of the turkish biggest company koc holding . moreover , if you do not want to take risk , you can not make any progress in your life . also , you can not make any step . you should take risk and try to do your best . at last , you should be brave what ever you do to be successful . because , when you are afraid of doing something new , you can not never be successful in your whole life . you should think the step you are going to make , but you should n't think it twice . when you think it twice , it will be too late to do it . in conclusion , to be successful , you should do thing which have never done before , take risk and never afraid of anything . when you do all them , there will be any reason to succeed . life is short and there is nothing you can not do .
