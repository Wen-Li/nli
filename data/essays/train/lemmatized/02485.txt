there are many way we can choose in our trip . there are two major and popular way for trip . one is travel in a group led by a tour guide , the other is travel by oneself . in my opoinion , i do n't agree with the following statement about `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . '' i have travelled in a different place since i wa a child . i travelled both in a group led by a tour guide and by myself . during these experience , i disagree with the following statement about `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . '' there are some reason and example to support my answer a follows . in my opinion , first , it 's waste time to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . many people will choose to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , becasuse they think it 's safe , especially they are in a foreign country . but , i think too many people will waste many time . because different people have different interest , travelling is in a group led by a tour guide , they ca n't make all of you feel the trip is just for you . sometimes travelling is in a group led by a tour guide will guide you to visit some place which are unnecessary or you do n't like . because travel agency ca n't satifify all of you . the second reason to support my answer is it 's waste money . when you join in a group led by a tour guide . it is certain they can arrange all your plan in a trip totally and you do n't have to worry many thing . but they will ask you to give them extra fee and tip in many way . third and last reason is you do n't have free and flexible time . as for me , i went to foreign country for studying for one month by meself . although i 'm not good at the language , comparing with other people i had much more free time and learned many thing in travel by myself . i have many different experience in traveling . this is way i disagree `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
