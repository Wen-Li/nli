in my opinion would be great to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject but to be more realistic i think that is better to specialize in one or a very narrow range of specific subject . first of all i guess that it would be very difficult to learn about many subject and that who want to follow this way have to spend so many effort on it . i totally disagree with the statement and the reason , which i mentioned previously , is because i prefer to be more realistic , in fact i think that if you are specialize in a specific subject you can improve your skill about it and you can get a job or be hired from someone more likely than if you have few notion about many thing . another important point is that if you are spacializing in a particular thing you are supposed to be very interested in it and you can really enjoy to study it and go more in depth . with a broad knowledge of many academic subject you can probably just have a shallow knowledge of them instead of study them deeply . at last i think that is pretty wrong to have a wide knowledge spread among a lot of subject even because i think that without specialist , the world , would n't be a it is know , i guess that it would be still a it wa in the past , without all the new invention that changed history society and our way of live . i know that probably i did n't argument my idea in depth and i am probably too confused but that is because i wa trying to disguise that i do n't agree with the statement because i do n't believe to be able to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject and i am disappointed about it . lol .
