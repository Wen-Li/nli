i think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in 20 year . there are three reason suppoting my opinion . first , many scientist take research to invent another moving method . foe example , flying vehicle can appear in near future because the speed of scientific progression is very fast . using this vehicle , we are free from the traffic jam and can move quicker than before from our home to our working place . as time go by , car may be diappeared on the earth . second , we can contact easily through internet-based commucation system . we do n't need to go to our company with car or something . exchanging e-mail and joining team-committe through telephone , we can check our work with our co-worker . now , we are not controlled by distance when we have a meeting . this is due to on-l ne lastly , people concern seriously their health . in modern life , there are no time to excercise because we are very busy . we have to work overtime , take care for our chidren and build up social-relationship . so , we can use commuting time effectively for our good health . instead of driving , we can ride a bicycle and jog to our work . in my company , one of my senior ride a bicycle everyday from his home to work . he is in a good shape and play well tennis and basketball . this activity could be help to boost out health condition up .
