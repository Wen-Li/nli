when it come to the matter wether it better for student to understand concept or learning fact i believe it more important for them to learn fact and it more is more convincing for several reason . the first reason i believe that why learning fact is better understanding fact and concept because i think learning fact is more useful to student in their life . like when a student understand an idea or a concept it should n't be right or true or it might not be a good idea or a concept that will not be useful for him or her , on the other hand when they learn fact they can form their idea about anything . the second reason why i think learning fact is more important than understanding idea , because i believe that fact can enourmosly develop the student 's character , the way he think about thing around him and the way he talk . like when a student are a part of discussion of a subject or any matter in life . he surely can participate in the discussion with the fact that he learned , on the other hand understanding idea wo n't do him any good in this area . the third reason why i think learning fact is more important than understanding idea because idea might be more useful at later age but in the age of studets learning fact is more efficent and effective on them i also believe that fact are easier for student to comprehend . for all these reason above , i strongly suggest that student should be more interested in learning fact than understanding the idea .
