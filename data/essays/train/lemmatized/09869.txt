i completely agree to the statement that adversitements really make the product look different and much better than it acually is . this is just a mode of increasing the sale of that product . advertisements do highlight the advantage of the product but every coin ha two side and all that look beautiful from outside is not always not so . they just exagerrate and present everything . lets not forget that people do beilieve these advertisement and end up loosening many time . some time back there wa an advertisement about some new hair product on tv and i it seemed so attractive that i could n't help getting it . the result were n't very impressive . i ended up with falling of my hair and dandruff problem which i never had . one shoud n't just beleive in what is presented externally , it is n't what it is actually . yesterday only i saw that advertisement about the quiznos sub stating that what they offer is much more , not only this but they also degraded the product of another competent . i do n't think that any one ha a right to do that . advertising your own product is acceptable but not degrading others . in my country the rule are different , people ca n't really do that . sometimes i really think that advertisement are just a mode for fooling people and nothing more , before buying anything at all one should find out the advantage and disadvantage both and than decide . dont just blindly believe in what is being presented . all that glitter is not gold . similarly all that lookes good is not always so . it is very easy to spend money but very diificult to earn . so dont just spend your hard money on these useless advertisement but think logically before you take a step . advertisements are helpful but not always .
