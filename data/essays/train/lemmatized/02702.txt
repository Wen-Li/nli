for decade researcher are to find an answer for this argument . who enjoys the life more young people or old . enjoying life doe not really depend on age it mostly depends on how much somebody like to live , wealth , and life condition . the first step of enjoying the life is loving it . at the age of twelve or fourty it doe not matter if somebody love to live he can enjoy his life more than anybody in this universe . also the way of enjoying life depends on what you like to do . because of the age advantage people think that young people enjoy the life more than the elder . the main reason for that is appropriate and inappropriate behavior . of course there are certaing thing that differs the young from the old but still this doe not mean young people enjoy life more than old people do . a wealthy person can do what ever he want . he can travel all around the world , eat all kind of food , and experience many different culture . this is what majortiy of the people think about enjoying life . if this is the only way to enjoy the life how should a person who life in an economy budget , can only afford living expense , and barely shop for himself feel . again this is just a fact to enjoy life is not the only way to enjoy it . enjoying life doe not depend on certain thing , especially age , wealth , or life condition . to be able to enjoy the circumstance and the condition for everybody might not be easy but otherwise all of u would be unhappy and the life would be miserable .
