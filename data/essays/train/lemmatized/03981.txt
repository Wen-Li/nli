advertisement industry ha marked a great change in last few year . people all over the world see advertisments either on television or read in news paper because they come to know about the new and latest product through advertisments . there is advertising for each and everything you name , computer , tour , kitchen appliance . .. etc . the advertisment either market the product or the supplier . anyways . .. i agree that most of the advertisement make procucts seems much better than they really are for the following reason . firstly , advertisers fool people by making there product more attractive and by presenting their product by a famous personality . let take an example , let take an add of a tooth paste . we all know tooth paste is used to brush our teeth and the advertiser make it attractive by adding some beautiful color , some flavour and inaddition the toothpaste is advertised by a foothball player . what happens next ? we the fan of the football player think that if the player is using that tooth paste than even we should use it . we dont even think what is so good in that toothpaste , it just colorful and attractive . secondly , sometime the product is not worth the price it is named . big company product have big price tag . lets look at this example , there are two company which are manufacturing jean , both us same material for the jean but the brand name are different . say one is lee and other is some brand . now when you go to a store and you want to buy a jean , which one will you choose ? i know it lee because it ha a brand name and it with a greater price . lastly , people are just attracted to the fancy and big thing . people thing that a more meet burger good than the same price a the veggie burger but here the qyantity differs . pay more and get le . all in all . it is all about business , all about money .
