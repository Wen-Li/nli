it is common opinion , that successful people have to try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . when i think of a successful discovery , the first thing that come to my mind is the discovery of america . christopher columbus tried to find a new sea way to india . but instead of finding a cheaper and better connection to india , he discovered america by accident . he took the risk of failure , because many people believed , that there can just exist one possible seaway . the thesis , that the earth is a plate and not a globe , supported their idea . instead of taking the usual , common way , christoph columbus tried to risk something new and succeeded in the end . but at the same time , new experiements and idea ma also turn into a catastrophy . one example can be the invention of nuclear weapon . einstein did not intend to destroy the world with his discovery . but if a new invention or knowledge get into the wrong hand , it can also be used an evil way . atomic bomb are now used to destroy life instead of secure it . another reason , why past tradition , idea and way are a equal important a new discovery and invention is the learning aspect . people have to learn from their failure and mistake , in order to succeed further . however , some thing can only develope when they had been already experienced before . in this way , people could discover their positive and negative aspect . we need the knowledge and the tradition of the past in order to find new and easier way . at the one hand , it is important to develope new idea to achieve success . but at the other , people are just able to learn , when they understand and observe past idea and thesis .
