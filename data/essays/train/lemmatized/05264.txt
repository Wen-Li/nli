as an undergraduate student i know the importance of understanding idea and concept more than fact . why ? well because i believe that the idea ha the important information . sometimes it is not necessary to know specific thing about a theme , it is more important to understand the central idea , so that the fact can be used a reference . for example , if a topic is a difficult one , it can be easier for someone to understand the idea first , so that later he or she can analyze the fact , solve problem using the fact , or investigate other fact . i think that if someone undestands the central idea and if that person is able to explain it to someone else , in a way that he can understand it too , it mean that he ha already learned the important thing . i am sure that to explain the idea he will use the fact he analized before , so he ha already relationed the fact and the idea . if the person remembers the fact . i am not sure , but i believe that most people can not accept a fact unless they understand why is that . it is not easy to tell somebody that something is going to happen in a certain way if something else . as a good example we have kid , they are always asking why is this , or that , and they do not stop asking until they understand the answer , and a they grow up they learn that fact have an explanation . i know that there are some fact that someone ha to know , some basic thing people ha to understand , like the meaning of a green light , because this is a sign that mean the same in the whole world , but fact like this are few , that is why i think that it is more important to understand the idea o concept .
