the travel in a group led by a tour guide is the safest way to do it , apart from the fum of being with the group and willing to have the best out of your tour , it will be wise and safe to have a tour guide who not only will guid you according to his knowledge and information but we will benefit from an experienced and skilled person to make our trip a safe trip together with fun side of it . let me share my experience with you ; whn i first arrived sydney 1981 and while i wa studying english class for the hour which i am entitle to , a a group in one class we decieded to go to blue mountian a our excersion , so we all agreed on that and one of our teacher will be the tour guide for u because previousely she did wa an official tour guide with the blue mountain . we all were very happy on the day when we got the train from central station to blue mountian and got off the train and catch a bus to get u to the right spot . we start bush walking and cliaming the mountian following our keader , chating , giggling and having abusoltley a good time while the seenery took our breath of the most beautiful view we ever seen when you look across and all what you see is one green piece of art . through out our jerouny we came cave and water full .. we had a few accedents of slipping on a weat rock , but alos we did a break to share our food together and talk about our life , then when we continued our trip it start to rain and the wind blowes , and unexpected one of our friend slipped and broke her ancle and could not walk so her husband had to carry her and because of that we were delayed in reaching th epoint were there two official people from the blue mountian waiting to receive u , because of our delay the official people alret the ranger to look for u , sany whay l
