i agree with the statement about traveling with the tourguide with a group is the best way . because of the following reason . you can learn lot of information about the famous place . i t 's cheap , you wo n't be lonely during the travel . and you wo n't have problem talking to the foreigner . these are the following reason and example to the question . the first reason is that by traveling with a tour guide , you can learn many new information about the famous place you are traveling . the tour guide can expain all the important thing and history about the place and help you understand more easily . second reason is that it is cheaper when you are traveling in a group rather than yourself . you can save a lot of money and if you are a student this can be the advantage to save money . money is really valuable , that is why everybody is saving them . i once visited italy with school friend when i wa young , we saved alot of money . third reason is that you wo n't be loney during the journey . when i wa traveling around italy with my friend i saw some people traveling alone and i thought that they looked really loney . when you are with the group you can chat and discus how you feel about what you see and stuff . and also you can make good relationship with the member of the group . you can talk to friend you have never talked with . i made alot of friend while i wa traveling and i 'm still in contact with one too . finally , sometimes when you are traveling alone , you can face problem talking with the resident that live on that country or any other foeigners . at this point a tour guide is very useful . he can translate and talk to them at your point of view . you can be confident with no frustration . for the conclusion i think traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better because you can gain many thing . information , save money , make new friend and be confident .
