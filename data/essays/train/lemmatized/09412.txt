i disagree with the statement because i do n't think that enjoying life ha anything to do with age . i believe there are more issue that have to be take into consideration in order to establish whether a person at any particular age doe or doe not enjoy life . health , for instance , is crucial for happiness and therefore can be determinant for enjoying or not enjoying life . one 's character and emotional stability are also important factor . i 'm sure there are old people that suffer from bad health and are not able to enjoy life fully , but this could also be the case of a teenager suffering from leuchemia and feeling miserable . he is young but not necessarily enjoys life . on the other hand , there must be people that being old , have the blessing of having the best health and therefore enjoy life more than troubled teenager struggling with their banality . other factor can infuence the conception of self-hapiness of a person like family , social or cultural class , opportunity , income level , etc . all these factor impact people of all age . i also think that it is a matter of attitude . while there are outer factor that influence the way we enjoy life or feel happy , it is what everyone make out of the siuations what at the end of the day determines their conception of happiness . the way we deal with problem and our ability to solve them , the very thought of ourselves a free living being and the attitude we have towards our enviroment , are factor that will make the people that sorround u decide whether we are enjoying life or not . the statement is misleading beacise it inferrs that young people can do more thing than old people and can therefore enjoy life more .
