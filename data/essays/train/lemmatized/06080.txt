first of all , having broad knowledge in many academic subject is necessary to be able to understand the world we live in , particularly the economic , political and social issue . indeed , broad knowledge of many academic subject , which are espacially tought at school and at the university , allows you to get a general and personal culture of almost every subject , like history , geography or literrature . of course , in that way you can not be a specialist of all those subject , but at least you can discus with people and have your own opinion about thing . on top of that , broad knowledge of many academic subject make you more mature and confident to start learning additionnal specific subject . it is , then , necesary to have this general knowledge to be able to go on . however , specializing in on specific subject make you more performant on a specific topic you are interested in , and allows you to enhance your own skill by making research or reading magazine about it . thus , you become a specialist of the subject and may be the best in that subject . besides , when you are specialized and maybe passionnate about something , you can try to find a job related to your specialization and be good at it . as for me , the both statement expressed in that sentence are both correct and necessary . indeed , a we wo n't never be aware of all the subject , it is the best to have broad knowledge about the most possible thing , to be able to understand the issue , the problem and more generally the world . but then , we should specialize in a subject we really like , in order to concentrate on a personnal interest and to improve our knowledge about a specific topic . that is why , the best for me would be to combine both of those aspect that is to say first learn the most academic subject we can to be able , then , to specialize and be good in a specific subject .
