yes . i think so it is not fine that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in on specific subject . because people having different idea of their subject . some people go for different subject like social and some people go for science . it depends apon how they study . some people having broad knowledge of their academy subject . and other dont . their should be information abot the academic what is the matter and what it matter . it all depends upon them . i prefer to go with broad knowledge of many academic subject . because iy help u to have more knowledge about the subject and we can easily understand the subject . broad knowledge help u to discus and share our opinion about a particular subject which mainly we choose . it is easy to specify the subject with a broad knowlede help to get good score in particular subject . so broad knowledge specialize and specify the subject easily . so gaining extra knowledge of subject is good . we know about the topic correctly and perfectly they we can futher proceed to next subject . this is what advantage to u that we have many information about the subject and how it help u in studting . ex ; a person who ha a little knowledge of subject get le mark . where a the other student have a good or broad knowledge about the subject will get more mareks because it is better for the student to have broad thinking . so this is only why the broad help u to allow u to collect more information u can knowledge help u ti have broad knowledge of many subject . it ok to choose a subject . i prefer it is better to have broad knowledge of many subject than one specific subject .
