there are so many advertisement in the tv , newspaters , and magazine . the purpose of the advertisement is the increse of the sale . maybe it work very well , for the advertisement still exist even though the cost of advertisement is so expensive . i agree with the statement that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i can easily find the example that the advertisement work well . my mother ha good conditioned refrigerator . there are no problem to preserve the food or to freeze the ice , but after she watched repeatedly the advertisement which explains the new and good funciton of the refrigerator during the tv drama , she considers whether to change the refrigerator to new model or not . i think the real funciton of the new refrigerator is not different from the old one we have . however , advertisement make her think the new refrigerator have better function and buy it . second , advertisment also provide people the illusion by showing that the famouse people use the product . famouse person like actor and sport star use the product and persuade the people to use the product in the advertisement . this type of advertisement make the image that the product is good because famous person use the product . the advertisement misleads someone to buy the prodcut even though the quality of the product is not good . in conclusion , the advertisments make people to buy product more if the advertisement doe not exist . the advertisement give the information of the product , but because the purpose of the advertisement is not only giving the information but also persuading the people to buy the product , thd advertisement definitely exaggerate the quality of the product and make the some image that differ from the real product .
