i do agree with the statement that succesful people try new thing and take new risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . it is the calculated risk that a person take that show his confidence and attitude towards life . trying out new thing keep a person from getting bored with the routine type of work . taking new risk always ha a chance for growth not only in what he/she is doing but also a a person . i can state my own experience a an example . i 've always been a topper in high school with excellence in mathematics . after graduating from high school most were taking up engineering and account for undergraduation . i realised i had an interest in science and dared to take the risk to face the competion to enter into a medical school . finally not only did i get into one of the top medical school with 98.5 % but also got a financial aid . all through the way i believed in myself and never let my confidence fall apart . and then i realised that i had a taste for music , which led me to become a disc jockey . i used it a a way to relax my tension from my academic curriculum . people thought how can a ` ld be doctor possibly be a dj . well , i know it sound weird , but i wanted to try someting new . it wa just the start and the list went on from organising medical camps , awareness campaign to starting a student organisation for sincerity , service and development . although you need discipline , hardwork and patience to reach goal , it is the difference which you make that matter . it show the attitude towards life and the confidence with which we move ahead . successful people are confident people with a positive attitude who try out something new always and try to make a difference in others ' life . every new task is a challenge for proficiency and confidence . they always want to see life in a broader prespective filled with challenge . as a matter of fact , everybody should try out new thing , which will develop their attitude towards life and will make them a better person .
