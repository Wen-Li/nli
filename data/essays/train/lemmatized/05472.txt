in today 's world , successful people try new thing while others doing what they already know how to do well . i agree that successful people always try new thing in other to succed . because people need new information and important to get new thing . first of all , if people never try new thing how can they succeed in their business . one of my friend 's mother ha her own food store she always try to find new information and think about how can increase customer more and more . even though she already know how to do well and what to do well . i think that is why she can keep her own business seccessfully . second , these day technology is amazing and increasing so that mean people make a lot of new thing and find new thing . every country are getting change in these day . in my opinion , sucessful people always try to find what is the best way and good . and then people can succeed perfectly . third , if people doing what they know how to do well , that is not enough and must be failed afterwards . every one know how to do well . however , it depends on how much people can try new thing and make good in order to succed . it doe n't matter that how to do well . my friend is also succed her own business when she tried to find new thing . this is the one of the good way if one doe n't want to fail one business . threrfore , i totally agree successful people always try new thing . then they will succeed .
