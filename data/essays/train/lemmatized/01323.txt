travling one of many thing the poeple like to do it . each persone or group ( family or friend ) who travil togther ha or have own way . one of these way is travel in group led by a tour guid . i diagree with the people who do or like that for many reason . first of all , always the tour guide ha a specfic time to do his jop every day . if you miss the group you miss all think . one of my friend who tried this before he unhappy and advise me to do not take it all of my live . when he wa in italy with the group . the people did not wake up in the morning and all day scuall wa done . second , some of the tour guide give the people who wuold like to travil with them the deams vecation . the try to make the group begger and complite the seat and room withch they maed reasvitions . in addation , when you spend this day you see lot of diffrentces . then you understand them . thired , you can do all of activeties by your self with your friend or family . search on the internet ask people who visitted the please you would like to spend your vacetion . you will save many , time , and have privesy ( privet ) . we like the tour guide ad and program . but still the travel with your group is the best . for all thes reason i complitlly disagree with the people who do or like that .
