young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . maybe . it 's also true that nowadays community that need to be helped are lot more than in the past . i think the main question is too big for being resumed in these two line . young people , right now , is more dedicated in avoiding it own big problem such drug , aid , racism and so on . describing the help a person can give to his community begin from the little . i can talk about my personal impression and action . in the city i live , milano , the helping attitude in general is so low , and people basically go on their own business . they do n't understand that giving help to someone may cost time , energy and can go over the rule . personally , i 'm training kid living in the suburb doing graffiti , an art that know how to create without loosing the feeling of the street . sometimes what we do could seem wrong to someone else , but i know i 'm taking with me those kid and keeping them away from really wrong habit they could begin to have . what me and few friend do is not helped by no church , organization or organized group : is something we do because we feel we can do something with those skill god gave u . is an action that go little , dedicated , moving in the shadow : we just know that those kid will have something right , colourful and creative to do in their street instead of beginning something wrong . beside that , every day is plenty of little but not le important occasion to helping people : giving your seat to someone more needful , bringing your old clothes to the local church , help someone crossing the street . little by little . sometimes a smile can last for day , even if it 's a glimpse . carlo .
