i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk . if some one would like to become bigger he should take risk because some obne doe not know thing work or not without trying . even you doing some thing already know you have develop your way of doing and folow the modernism that brought by the age that we live . every day need of people and treatment toward the life are chanching . i would like to illustrate my opinion with an example . i would like to tell you about a simple farmer who wa becoming the king of oil producer in turkey . it is not important the name of the person but it is important the way that he done thing . this person used to grow olive and sunflower in izmir one of the biggest city in west turkey . and he thought to produce olive and sunflower oil rather than sell his production . he could earn much if he produce oil from the plant that he growed . an d bought an old oil factory and started his own company . he worked day and night and won the belife of the consumer and growed and growed . the second of the person life wich also demonstrate the benefical site having risk to try new thing that . when the date showed late sixty people have started to chanche their way to buy oil . they before pereferred to buy 20 kg can but now they buy 2 kg pet bin . so our hero see need of the new need and bought some new machinery to produce the pet bin that the oil factory . finially , i can say that if this person did not try new thing to do , i thing he ha still remained a a simple farmer .
