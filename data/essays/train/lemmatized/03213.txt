i completely agree with this statement . there is no point in knowing fact without capturing the essence of the idea . this applies to all field of study . as a civil engineering student in mexico city i had to learn many formula and technique to solve many problem . we would concentrate mainly on structural design , having to learn to apply these method by heart . there wa not much sence in learning the formula because in the real world we are able to open a book . the real important part came when we had to understand the effect and the cause that interact with the structure at study . a good engineer is the one that really understands the structural behavior of what he is building . the same applies to a history student . there is no point in knowing all the exact date of historical event if there is no understandig of the essence of the study . what good would it do if the student doe not have a feel on how a culture lived , what they ate or what they thought which lead to the historical event . the date will stay in almanac forever but the real learning come from understandig the idea and the concept . schools today tend to lean towards a more understanding way of teaching . they focus mainly on atracting the student 's attention by taking them on field trip or by having more interactive material to teach with . computers and the internet help to visualize and understand concept that would have been difficult to explain without them . there are also easier way to obtain factual information now than before . this make it almost useless for a student to learn the fact . they have to focus on understanding the idea and be able to apply their knowledge in real life . the only way to do so is by having the right education .
