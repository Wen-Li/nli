can you imagine a world without car ? i think that in this society we are living is very difficult thinking about it , because we have only few referements on our life , and one is the car . we use the car for everything : going to work , to school , for making shopping , going to the supermarket , for having a trip . . for everything . we have lost the capacity of thinking that we can use . . leg or bicycle . we are becoming even more lazy that in the past , and we do n't want to spend energy on walking . that is a pety because everyone know the importance of the enviromental problem . every day we are reading on the newspaper that pollution is a real problem for the earth and should be soved . . but is not easy when peolple think only for themselves and not for the entire society . it 's even true that to maintein a car , people spend a lot of money every year . . for gazoline , and assicurances , and all paper you have to make in order to make your car able to be driven . but in contrast , is evident that car are very usefull , and solve communication problem : car let to think nearby to someone that really life far away from you , and permit to have experience of life . for example permit you to make a cheap trip around a region , or around a continent , giving you the possibility of having a sicure place to sleep , and for young people ( who do n't have much money . . ) that is an important thing . in conclusion , for all these reason , i think that the use of car will not diminuish because it is a sourse of confortability , and benefit for the middle class person .
