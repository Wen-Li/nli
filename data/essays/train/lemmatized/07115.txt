what 's is the successful people ? some people may say they have a lot of money and hard worker . i think it mean the successful person try new thing and take risk . i think successful person try to make the new world , study harder and they have a big dream . people do n't respect the nomal person . peopel respect the successful person because they try to do the thing which the nomal person could't to do that . so people called the successful people and they can get a lot of money . first , they try to make the new world . for instance computer programer make a atractive world . nowadays we can easy to show this skill in the movie and enjoy that . they can make everything in the computer such a background , animal and universe . this skill make u increase our imagination . however computer programer try to make the new world everyday because they must give u the new thing which make u surprise and ca n't image . they must try to be left behind the world . otherwise they lost the job . second , they study so hard . for example i usually watch the student in the bus . they try to make the picture hardly . they must try to do again and again and admit from the people . just enjoy the picture doe n't make money . the successful people are very few . if you make the success , you should try harder . third , they have a big dream . everyone want to get a success and get the money . and everyone hope to respect from somebody . for example i can tell you about me . i came here to study about nursing . even though my native language is different and sometimes i ca n't comunicate with people . but i try to continue to study because i want to be a resercher in japan . it took long time and big money for me . but i want to believe my future . if i continue to work in japan , i can get the good life . that 's why i agree with this opinion . and i think the successful person is a hard worker and good dreamer . i hope to be like that .
