i agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i think that all people need to basic skill and knowledge . if i did not know launguage , i did not study at all . when i got the job that is very supecific jpb , if i did not broad knowledge , i would not work at all . for instance , mr takenaka who wa japanese prime minister , is specilized in economics . he decided a lot of effective economics bill . but mr takenaka did not know other progrems well . he made some happening in sumit because he is locking knowledge of international rule . and he made bad effect wellfere bill because of his locking knowledge . so , mr takenaka 's example say that good economist who specilize someone did not always good prime mminister . thus we should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than spcialize in one specific subject . if you want to change your job , you can easy to change because you have broad knouledge of many academic subject . but i did not disagree with having knowledge specialize in one specific subject . if i have specidic skill and knouledge , i can be charastaristic . and i can easy to get my job . so i suggested that pepole , who want to study , should study about broad knowledge of many academic subject a people find supecific subject that they want get knowledge . in my experience , i wa high school student . i would like to became a doctor . but i did not study specalize in sicology . i studeied many subject , and i reconsider what i want to become . as day go by , i would like to become a international accountant . so i can change my future easily , because i had broad knowledge of many academic subject . and now i major in economics in university . so i think that it is important to get broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
