i think it is more important to use their idea and depend on their imagination . of couse every idea can be based by fact . but sometimes it 's worng because student have to try to think creat thing someyears ago . many school forced student to study with fomula and memorize only fact . they did n't allow student to speak their opinons freely . but these day , many system have changed in school . they ecourages student creative activity . when the childhood is important to student they do n't know well about the society and future and around many thing . the free thinking can be helpful in our society . these thinking can produce more advaced future . just to learn the fact and memorizes block them from free thinking and the ability to imagine about everything a much a they can . for example , i read the book a few day ago after reading the book i agreed with it . the book include about fomula education . the childeren learn mathmathics in school they have to solve the problem but they ca n't count the number well . when they learned mathmathics they were foced to remeber the formula and they always studied almost same question . sometimes they faced higer problem but also they depended on the fomula . so , oneday their homeroom teacher asked them `` which is bigger , 1/4 or 1/2 ? '' child answered `` 1/4 '' they knew only bigger number . they could n't think about the amout and range and degree . so i suggest that they shoud be learnd with new way like experiment and expression their think , even if it 's worng . another one is about the art . art include alot of thing . such a drawing and taking a picture and acting so on . i want to say about the acting actor or actress do n't know how to act and speak before getting the paper with their role . they have to act depend on themselves . and have to imagine and understand the situation . the fact out the situation is not enough to make a movie audience expect to see the scenery which they ca n't do and ca n't think . so the filmmaker have to satisfy such the people . in conclusion , i think it is better to understand and concept about the problem and situation and everything than to learn only fact .
