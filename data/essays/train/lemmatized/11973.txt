fewer car in twenty tear ? only time will show if the statement that there will be fewer car in the future might be true . nowadays this seems more like wishful thinking . during the last twenty year the number of car ha surely increased causing traffic almost to collapse and polluting the environment in an alarming way . the way this situation ha been developing , it is clear that it could not go on forever . happily , people become more aware of the damage the traffic and the pollution are causing and have started to rethink their relationship to their beloved car . since people realize that change have to be made , they try to build group and drive together in only one car or make more use of bike or other transportation option such a bus and train . also the government ha been trying to encourage the use of other mean of transportation by raising the tax on gasoline and supporting the train or admitting tax refund for car that meet higher ecological standard . another point , that might even be the decisive one , is that the reserve of gasoline will not last forever . ther will come a point where there will be no gasoline left . despite all this , the car industry is also adapting to these problem , building car that use le gasoline or can burn hydrogene or even alcohol . this would indicate , that there probably will not be fewer car but different and more ecological car . on the other hand it would kill thousand of job , if the automobile industry would produce fewer car . as for the traffic problem , new street and new traffic system are beeing planned . there are godd reason to believe that there will be fewer car in the future but ther also are the same amount of reason to doubt this . i belive that there will not be fewer car but it would make me happy to see that peole get more aware of the damge they can cause and use car le than today . i also belive that there will be a improvement on the ecological effect fo car diminushing the polllution und the use of gasoline
