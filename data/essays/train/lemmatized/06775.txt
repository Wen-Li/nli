most people love to travel to different place . the question here is whether we have to go alone by ourselves or to go by a group that will led by a tour guide . my opinion is to travel in a group led by a tour guide . i agree to this and i will explain you about my opinion . first if you think you are going by yourselves . you only planned the trip . your hotel booking everything wa done through internet . even though you listed the visiting site from the internet . if you travel to that place with out the tour guide , that trip thats not at all going to be fun why because travel guide know the history of each and every place we are going to visit . he will explain in you detail . if any thing happens to you like if you will be sick suddenly what will happen you just imagine this kind of situation . second is travel in a group that will be led by tour guide . there are many advantage . fisrt thing is in a group mean you surely will have lot of fun . travel guide take to different place , he will explain the history of those visiting place . one more thing he will fix the timing like at what time you have to get up ? , at what time you have to leave one place and go to another place . so you wont have much tension about this planning . travel guide will take care of all these . one more thing is we will get lot of concession in lodging because a we are going by a group and travel guide might be knowing some familiar hotel , where he will get some concession obviously amount of money we need to pay will be le . one important thing if suddenly we will be sick he will arrange u to go to the hospital a we are new to that place being a travel guide he might have known all the place and facility what we will get . as there is a saying in english '' every coin has two sides '' . there are advantage and disadvantage but my advantage out weigh the disadvantage . over all conclusion is every person once in their life time will travel to different place . if you travel in a group that led by tour guide you surely will enjoy the trip , you are going to have lot of fun . you are going to meet lot of different people , you can exchange their view , you can know about different culture provided all this can be done , if we are guided by a travel guide . travel guide take care of every thing . he will take our tension by making u happy and he will see that we enjoy the trip .
