ideas are caused by thinking intensely or doing indepth research about any particular subject . understanding the concept will make the person researching that particular subject a versatile in that particular subject . a fact may leave the student only with the outer layer of an indepth knowledge related to that subject rather than understanding `` what lie beneath '' . during my tenure a a trainer with a particular organization i trained a lot of student to become effective worker . and this experience make me suggest that understanding idea and concept is much more important than knowing fact . when i trained employee regarding a product i.e aquring transportation permit for various truck and tractor , i always had to talk about indepth detail , about `` concept '' . otherwise the person will not be able to decipher from the request a to what kind of permit he/she ha to order for . the concept of what decides a requiremnt should be understood rather than just knowing the requirement . for example , a customer request for a permit for a particular type of vehicle to travel interstate ( that it is not licensed for ) , which usually is provided by the company and if the vehicle is used by a red cross organization which doe not necessarily have to acquire a per the law . now theoritically the agent taking the request should provide the permit . now this is where concept and idea play a vital role . if the agent did not pay attention to these concept during training he/she will probably end up issuing a permit which is not required . another simple example : if a student know a fact that the light bulb function with just a press of a switch , he know pretty much what he is supposed to know . but , when faced a challenge with the light bulb not functioning if he doe not know what different component of that tubelight emit light and what other product make it work , he probably will not be able to make it work . instead , he would be wasting time waiting for a technician to attend to it . an equally interesting example is mathematics . if student do not understand the idea and concept of formula and how to work with them to find a solution for a particular problem then knowing just the fact which is just a formula would not help them solve differnbt problem of the same nature . therefore , i conclude by saying that student should definitely pay more attention to understanding idea and concept more than just learning fact . not just student at school but student in all walk of life .
