the issue at hand is whether there will be fewer number of car in usage in the next twenty year . in my view a the technology is progerssing at a faster pace and the economy of an induvidual will be increased so there will be increase in the number of car in the next twenty year . firstly , when we consider from a point of improvement in the technology many advancement have been made in the field of technology when we deal with the car of the past they used to give a lesser mileage than the sophisticated and welly improvised car of today offer . when we relate technology to the economic condition of any country , a there is an improvement in the technology and hence it would create employment for the people there by the economic status of the induvidual increase and hence the car being the symbol of luxury everyone want to travel in a car so in my view the usage of number of car would drastically increase in the next twenty year . futhermore , when we look at the issue from other point of view like when the time is taken into considerartion the car of today are much faster basically because of the technology used . for example in olden day in the sense in the nineteenth century the mean of transport wa mainly by bus , cycle and tram , but after the foray of the car into the world of transport it revolutionised the field by not only providing luxury , and comfort but also people were able to reach their destination in time . in a busy world of today where every thing is run by machine time is the major constraint . so for the people to reach their destination a early a possible car provide a basic mean of transport . lastly when we consider the fuel which is used in the car there ha been a drastic improvement . initially it wa petrol and diesel , now due to the advancement of technology the car are driven by using battery , by using latest technology of using a motor-generator set mechanism which bought a revolution in the field , so people will have various option to choose from and the research is still going on in this field to find out a cheaper fuel on which the car will run so it will affordable to all the section of people , so the usage of car is going to increase in the future . i disagree with the issue that there will be fewer number of car in the next twenty year because improvement of technology , foray of various kind of fuel on which the car can run , and the economic condition of the country , the life style of people - these are the various factor which contribute to more usage of the car in the next twenty year and near future .
