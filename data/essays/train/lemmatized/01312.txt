in japan , where i live , there are many traveler around famous place such a kyoto , fukuoka , and tokyo . as the way of trip , some people feel that travel in a group with a tour guide is the best way . however , in my opinion , i disagree that the best way is to travel in a group . i prefer to travel individually . more importantly , i can go to travel when i feel to want travel . if i plan to go somewhere , immediately i can go everywhere and everytime . however , if i go to travel in a group , it is necessary to arrange the time that member in a group can gather . for example , last sunday i went to hotspring alone in okutama , which is famous for hotspring location in japan . at that time , i could go there soon because i did not need to gather friend . additionally , individual travel ha a lot of chance to touch local people . when i travel individually . i try to talk to local people for knowing the real situation that i can never know from reading a guide book . when i went to the united states individually this january , i got wonderful experience thanks to talk to local people . when i spoke to police in new york , i could enjoy to speak english and have fruitful talk with police . if i went to new york in a group , i could not have such an experience . therefore , from these reason i do not agree that the best way for trip is in a group led by a tour guide .
