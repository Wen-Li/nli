aactual fact are more realistic than fact and concept , i totally disagree that is it is more important for student to understand idea and concept though they will be helpful to a certain extent , but fact are different , having an idea to achieve certain objective and setting a goal to achieve is a good thought , but in it way of reaching the objective you will find it difficult , so when you plan to achieve something dealt it with fact of the real life and try to reach your gaol every idea can not be put into practice if it is put into practice one should look into procs and con of the result what a waste of time when you can not take thing which are fact here an example of a mountaineer who want to climb mount everest he take certain precautionary measure before going for a expedition like the climatic condition , medical equipment , food and other thing while climbing he face the actual realty of how difficult it is to climb in the case of student it hold good a well meagre having ideal you can not real your goal a intended you should also think of the procs and con bearing actual fact on the mind the concept to achieve a particular goal is also veryimportant a personcan acieve alot in his life by having an idea thus alot of discovery are made based upon the idea and concept but once should estimate it thorougly by making into account thereal fact and the result these ideal and concept will lead u into it is verygood to have idea and concept for a student whowants to be good , honest , gentle , hardworking but in real world it is upto him whether he can follow it or not , if he can follow it is well and good for him and the society
