life is the best present for all people from god . everbody use it in so many different way , so many different place and inside completely different people . also in every age life become different too . however young people do n't enjoy life than the older people every time due to chracter of human and belief of people . chracter of human determine every detail of the human life . some people can kill themselves im the spring of their life and some of them try to survive after a terrible accident and a few of them achieve incredible work after they are 70 . this is completely independent from the age . if a person is optimistic , if his or her family support him in his bad term , in big trouble . if they have good friend to help them people enjoy life even after 100 year old ! believes of people can also make difference in human life . consider about a child . whether his mother dead after a horriable accident , how can we explain this complicated situation to him . his life become a nightmare all over his he can not enjoy his life . however , if we explain everthing in religion side and we said him ` your mother is in the heaven now and she is happier than us` , everthing in his life make sense after that . then he can enjoy his lkife forever . to sum up , enjoying life is not about age , it is about character of people and human belief . the happiest person in the world could be 80 year old . unfortunately , most of the people who killed themselves in the world are young people . if a person can not understand the meaning of life he can not enjoy anything but if a person is optimistic he can write love poem just only looking at the sun rising ! god bless u . ..
