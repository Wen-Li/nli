i am agree with this statement and there are several reason in my opinion ; first , young people think differently than older because they do n't have the same way of thinking . young people are not self consencious , they often prefer playing instead of work at school . .. they do n't have the same p more they often do n't have responsability like work to win money and to live in good condition , keep their child . .. that 's why then , young people are not responsable yet , contrary to their parent for exemple . generally they do n't have child . so they often go in the club , go to the party with friend . .. but we can say the contrary because sometimes , older people are enjoying life more than younger . for exemple , when they finished to work , they often decide to make a trip , travel , do their garden , cooking . .. they profite to realize some hobby . because they won money during her life
