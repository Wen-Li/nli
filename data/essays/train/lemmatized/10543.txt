i think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . in fact ; you may come across few situation that some people have broad knowledge of many academic subject . but you ca n't see this kind of people generally . because they are very clever and hardworker than the normal people . if we talk about in general except this kind of people , i agree with the statement about specializing in one specific subject . the first reason of this choice is that the concentration on one subject is easier than more subject . you can focus on that subject , make good preparation and think much way of that subject many time . second you may not have much time for being qualified in many subject . so you can spend your time only one subject and get more information and make yourself well educated about that subject . otherwise , you are supposed to dividing your time and power all the subject that you interest in . third , if you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , you may pay a lot of money for that . and you wo n't be well qualified in ne subject . and all you know will be on the surface of those subject . you can never go deeper about the subject . fourth , when people ask you your professionallity , are you going to say to them `` i have broad information many subject but not one particular field . '' ? it will be funny . so if you want to be admitted from the university or the academic environment , you have to meke yourself professional in one subject . otherwise they wo n't approve your ability . finally , you have to choose one subject that you realy like and adapt yourself very well and try to be qualified in that subject . you will see that you make the right chose .
