i would definetly disagree with the statement . i say this because i am of the opinion that nobody is good at everything . students can not cope up with the pressure of learning and handling such vastly diverse knowledge . to have such a general base of knowledge with many subject at once can bring in the effect of a student not being good at any of them . i agree that there are case where some exceptional student might be good at many subject , but thats not the general case . the general student can take only so much amount of knowledge . i believe that one must learn aleast one thing perfectly rather than half-learn a hundred thing . in today 's world of highly advanced technology there is too much information and knowledge to learn and it becomes hard for student to master even one subject perfectly . such being the case , a broad array of subject will only increase the strain on the student , which may lead for him to get confused about the actual subject that he is really interested in . for example , what good doe a math student get from learning chemistry ? it will only put him through a lot of strain to learn a thing which he really is n't interested in . and i think it is really bad for student who have a focus in their life and have set goal to excel in a particular field , to have many academic subject . it will only bring down their enthusiam and zeal to learn more about their favourite subject . and in event like when they fail to clear a subject which they dont like , they have to end up studying it all over again . this only add to their stress and delay in trying to study what they actually want to study . also , people who get the oppurtunity to learn what they rally like will definetly excel in it . their brain will work better for the subject they like . and it will unfair to judge everyone by the same yardstick if we have many subject . i mean to say that while some people will be good at one subject they might fare really bad at the rest . so u can not have a common benchmark a such , to judge their talent . and so i totally disagree with the statement that `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of academic subject rather than specialize in one subject '' .
