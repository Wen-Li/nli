have you ever bought any item that you do n't have serious need to use ? if you have experienced this case , it is because of a drastic advertisement . people who live in modern world are member of capitalistic society . an advertimest ha a role of making consumer buy it product . so , i think that advertisement usually make people overestimate the price of product . it is because of the purpose of advertisement , the model of advertisement , and the indirect feature of advertisement . first of all , i think the purpose of advertisement is the important reason to make people misjudge product . the role of advertisments are to urge consumer to buy everything the company sell . in order to fulfill their goal , company is going to whatever they can do . therefore , most company merely want to emphasize the good aspect of their product . as a result , product look better than they pratically are . secondly , i believe that the model of advertisement make product look much better . usually , most advertisement tend to hire famous star , sport player , and any super star a their model . people can believe whatever super star say in advertisement because super start so famous that people regard them a reliable human . so , using super star for advertisement is another reason for overestimating . thirdly , it is obvious that people ca n't esimate any product directly by advertisement . through any advertisement , everything look good all the time . however , all aspect of the product are indirect experience . people ca n't touch , use , smell , hold and even see directly through any advertisement . therefore , it make product look better to consumer . most people live in capitalistic society . every company want to make consumer buy their item by it advertisement . because of the purpose of it , the model , and indirect feature of a advertiment , people can overestimate the quality of product .
