i agree with the fact that most of the advertisement that we see on television , on magazine , on the news paper and on the radio make the produts that they are trying to sell so much better than they really are . first of all because they know exacly what would attract the men , the woman , the teenager and the kid . they would adapte any product for the client by telling them what they want to hear . it 's like a brain wash . we are all in this century , in this buble were there are icones and thing we do just because everyone doe . we just all follow . the worst is when on the television or the magazine they use model for the publicity just to attract the most they can . and a a matter of fact people actually fall in this completely , of course they will rather buy a orange top that they saw on a celebrety than a radom top bought in the supermarket . it 's nothing we can do about this right now because we are in the middle of it , i 'm myself influence by the trend and everythings . i admit it . but there is a limite to this because soon or later we wont be thinking ourselves , the people that decides and rule all of the trend , publicity will controle u , will set up what we think is nice or good etc . .. hopefully we are going to stop looking up at the advertisement and choose from ourselves within we like something or not and not to be influence . i 'm not drastic about this i just get a bit mad when i start to think about all of that because the product with the best advertisment are much more expensive nad there is a lot of kid that ca n't follow up with the trend and that will anything to .
