i agree that to have broad knowlege of many academic is better than to specialize in one specific subject . i have two reason why i agree this opinion : the goal of education and feature of modern society . first of all , the goal of education make a good person who is adapted the society . to make a good person , the school teach many academic subject . because the person must study the many academic subject , he would be adapted the society . for example , two high school in korea had another curiculums . the one had many academic subject in curiculum , and the other high school had a one specifiec subject in curiculum . which high school 's student were succeeded ? answer is the former . also , the modern society want to multipalyer who performs various task . as one might expected , to specilize in one specific skill is better than to have broad skill of various field . however , this society make a multiplayer . in my experience , i work my company which ha many task . because i do n't have no various academic knowledge , i can not promote the manger first time . it is commly belived that to specilize in specific subject is better than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . but , this opnion is not available nowadays . to know many thing is allowed to victory the competition .
