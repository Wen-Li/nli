in my opinion you have to consider a lot of thing for when you are traveling this all different thing will affect where you go and how you spend your time wherever you will go . in my opinion traveling in a group led by a tour guide ha a lot of good and bad thing . the good thing are that you get to see museum to learn about a lot of stuff of the place you are visiting it is also easier to travel with someone that know the place you are going and who can understand the language of the place they are going . but you are also limited to the number of thing you can do or the number of place you can go if you were with no tour guide . on the other hand traveling in a group with no tour guide ha many positive and many negative thing . some of the positive thing have to do with the night life you can go wherever you want at whatever time you want , you can change plan whenever you want like if you planned to go to italy and in the last minute you decided you want to go to germany instead then you would just by a plane ticket that easy !!! some of the bad thing is that you could get lost or something could happen to you and there wa nothign you could do if you didnt have someone who knew the place and spoke the same language . in my opinon the best way to travel is with no tour guide because i like taking risk and going to place by myself .
