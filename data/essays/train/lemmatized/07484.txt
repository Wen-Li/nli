i believe learning idea and concept is far more rewarding for student than only learning a bunch of meaningless fact . specially a the student start to progress in his knowledge , idea and concept should become more and more relevant than fact alone . even though the normal process to reach a concept or idea requires u to learn fact before understanding them , it is clearly of higher importance to understand the concept a whole . in fact , understanding the concept is the only way to apply all the fact we learn . for instance , in my working experience i have noticed how two different person aproach problem . the first one try to memorize the solution and doe not care about the underling reason of the problem . the second one reaserches the fact for the superior task of understanding the problem a a whole . clearly the second one always come with new and suported idea on how to resolve the situation , however , the first one is always talking about specific information that doe not help the solution at all . another example of the higher importance understanding idea have over learning fact is the following . when there is a complete understanding of the concept you can apply the same concept to a similar situation regardless of the different fact you may encounter . addittionally , the sum of idea and concept can even form a more complete and complex reasoning for a wide variety of situation . on the contrary , the sum of fact would not lead u to the same aplication regarding diferent situation . the fact that idea and concept are of higher value is the only fact student should have on their mind a they progress in their knowledge . i definatly believe it is more important for studentes to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
