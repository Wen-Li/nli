i disagree with the statement . i think there will be a increasing need to own car around the world majorly due to ( i ) worldwide population growth and ( ii ) industrialization of under or le developed country . even though the rate of increase seems to modify , the global population is still in increase , thereby creating basic ground for the need of new car . as you may easily imagine , the more people live in the earth , the more personal vehicle they will need , and certainly no other personal vehicle ever invented will outbeat the car in the foreseeable future . the industrialization of under or le developed country , such a those in africa or asia , will also create new need for the car . looking back the history of 20th century , it is reasonable to think that there will be many under or le developed country will grow to be more industrialized in 20 year . the industrialization will stimulate the construction of the infrastructure , such a the road and increase the level of income of each people . when two thing combined , the massive need for the new car will be created . taking for example , korea , my home country , there were not many car in 1980 's . however , together with the rapid industrialization , a number of car used in korea ha increased dramatically . one may argue that a the people grows older , they tend not to drive a car and a the average life of people around the world get longer and longer , it will cut the number of car used in the future . i agree , in part , to such argument , but in my view , when people get older , they normally do not buy new car when their car get outdated , rather than immediately dispose of the car that they owned . therefore , such an impact , even though it may be real , will not be huge . putting such factor into consideration , i trust that the car which will be in use after 20 year will outnumber the be
