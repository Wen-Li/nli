a lot of people want to be successful , and they try to succeed in different way . some people prefer to take risk and try new thing , while others prefer to succeed by doing thing that they master . i always succeed because i do thing that i do well . i do n't like to feel the uncertainty of doing something new , i do n't like to make mistake , and i do n't like to waste my money . primarily , when i do something new , i do not know what is going to be the result . i feel better when i have the certainty of the thing , and i always succeed . i need to turn unknown thing into known thing because i will have more probability to do better thing in my life . i have been successful all my life because i always try to master the performance of many activity in my daily life . secondarily , doing new thing inplies many mistake because people have to try many time in order to improve their performance . when people make mistake often , they can lose credibility with other people . if other people are observing me , i try to perform better my activity . finally , trying new thing offer the invovenience of spending a lot of money . each effort ha a high cost because the possibility of failure is great when i do new thing . experiencing with new trhings requires either new material and equipment or more people . all these resource are very expensive . therefore , i prefer to save money and do thing that i do well . successful people do thing in a different manner . while some of them try to do somethiong new , others do thigs that they do well . i do not like to take risk in my life , so i try to do thing well all the time . taking riks is insecure , risky , and expensive .
