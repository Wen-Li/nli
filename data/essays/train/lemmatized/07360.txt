ideas and concept are more important because if student understand they will learn more information and is easier to a student to understand the class if they know the principal idea and concept . the principal idea and concept of a topic make easier learning for the student . because they do not have unuseful information . firstly , tacking into account that all the student have to learn more information about the world , they have to understand what the teacher is telling . so they have to learn understanding only the principal idea and the principal concept of the topic . if they try to learn all the thins that the teacher are telling they will not understand so they have to learn only the main idea and the main cocept of the topic . secondly , all school would have only preparated teacher because there are a lot of school that have very bad and not preparated teacher . preparated teacher know how to transmit the information that they know to the student , but they have to transmit it in an easy way to the student . they have to resume all the topic becuse the student only have to learn the useful thins that are only idea and concept . finally , teacher in all the world have to preparate theirs self to teach better the student because the student need new concept and new idea to grow intelectually . as a final analisys , preparated teacher have a lot of form to transmit information to the student . but they have to give only the principal idea and the principal concept of that information to make easier the understanding of the student . but also student have to put a lot of attention in the class that the teacher are giving to learn the new information that the world ha on this day .
