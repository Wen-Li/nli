in our modern society , we more frequently come across zoung people laughing and entertaining than older people . does it really convey the idea that young people enjoy life more than people do ? i believe that with maturity come experience and a tremendous knowledge which help individual navigate their life more easily and have more time for fun and entertainment . we will see how the period of life , the personality of each of u and our aim drive our enjoyment of life . it is a matter of fact that different period of life offer different opportunity for enjoyment . a younger person will believe he ha his whole life in front of him . naturally he will feel le concerned about his future and long-term objective . usually younger person have a better health and feel invicible like if they would never die . taking all these concern away is probalbly the reason why people who just came of age give the impression of enjoying very much their life . going through study , youngers are for the first time facing their first fundamental question : what do they want to do in their life ? older people have already gone through these fundamental question and have their life accomplished , giving them more opportunity to relax and enjoy life . of course , given the fact that each of u is unique , we indeed have different personality . personally i am an anxious person who always think about my future and the next step in my life . for this reason i sometime have the impression to enjoy le my life when i should like many other have a more cursory attitude towards life . older people when they reach the third age are concerned about how people will remember them and what they have accomplished in their life . although we all experience stress and difficulty at different period of our life , it is important to see the positive aspect of life and benefit from the experience we build throuhout our life . therefore i believe there is no specific age for enjoying more life . what is important is to keep an open and positive attitude whatever difficulty we go through .
