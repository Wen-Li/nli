`successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing whwt they already know how to do well ' yes i agree with this statement . in general successful people have done this step before i know many people how have taking a risk in order to arrive to their aim . for exemple mr. mohammed is a director of a company of construction . he wa a modest worker before . one day he say . why not having my own company / ? so he get a llong experience in construction then he try to buy a small area of land then after he sell it by a high price then he buy other land . after that he get a lot of money to realize his company . at this time he want to have an other company for his son . at the moment his son is a student at the institute of technology in the same field according to this exemple i 'm plaised to enter in a big risk to improve my situation and i 'm ready to support all risk that i will have in the future . most famous people do that . to sum up having a risk can improve and help people to have a success life but it should be taken with a long study and responsability
