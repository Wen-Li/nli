i personally agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to helping their community . it 's quite usual to see that several young people hanging out in a pub or a football field , but it 's unusually to see they are appearing at community centre or a aged person 's back yard to help him/her to clean . the world is becoming more attractive to young people than ever before . the internet , various computer game , gaming console , fancy toy and etc. have been taking a lot of time from the young generation . compared to the past , young people used to spend more time on studying , and also more time on participating community activity , and helping and learning from each other . the relationship between people , especially in urban area , are getting far more looser than before , which partially cause young generation are more relying on themselves than on the neighbourhood . everyone is busying on their own stuff and trying to make more money to get so called better life while ignoring the importance of the community that they belong to . family teaching may be another reason why young people prefer staying away from others . lots of fact showed that our society are not becoming safer . instead , we are seeing moer and more criminal reported everyday , our neighbourhood are no long a safe place to be . lots of parent are more likely to leave their child at home while they are busying on their own business . from very young , child learnt to play with themselves at home , and to spent their time at home . to conclude , young people should be taught to engage in more community activity which will help them to understand an important part of life , which is to help others to make the society more beautiful .
