to be honest , i disagree with the given statement , which suggets that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , for many reason . in my opinion , if you travel accompanied by a guide and a group , you will not be totally free of any movement . i mean , usually , this kind of organized travel plan the trip from the beginning to the end and you have no other choice than to follow it . when i am travelling , i prefer to remain able to decide where i want to go and what i want to see . the guided tour will obviously take me to the most touristic point in the country i am visiting , but usually , those place are not the most interesting , judging by the differents trip i had the chance to do . it is not rare while visiting a city or a country to find surprising place , mainly ignored by the tourist but many time more attractive and pleasant than the well-known sight . when i decide to leave my daily routine to enjoy the pleasure of a trip abroad , it is always to go somewhere i can be alone . i live in geneva , switzerland , in downtown , so i am used to live surrounded by a lot of people . so for me , travelling mean going a far away a i can go from that , and doing it with a group doe not exactly help to find this tranquility . i do not talk about leaving with a friend or a few people , even though i have never travelled with more than one person , but it is still a huge difference compared to travelling with a bunch of people you mostly do not know . another point which make me disagree with the statement is that i absolutely hate the guided tour . do not get me wrong , it is not that i do not like the cultural aspect which can lead me to learn a lot of interesting thing , but i find utterly boring to listen to someone who repeated his speech so many time he doe not take any pleasure to do it anymore . i prefer get the cultural information from a travel book or from a local citizen , who often love to proudly talk about the history of his country . you can not even stop some once they started , but at least they do it led by their heart . to sum up , i could say i do not have any interest by going in vacation with a group and a guide .
