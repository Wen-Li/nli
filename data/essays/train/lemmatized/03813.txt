well to start with i utterly disagree with such statement because i believe that a man 's life resembles the different semester of the year , in each lie beauty and happiness a well a problem and solution . younger people are more motivated to start thier journey in life , they feel stronger and more motivated to prove themselves , they have different kind of activity and interest . they are in the spring semester of their llives , where they are still green and growing fast . they have a vast majority of choice and a load of decision to make . while older people are more relaxed , they are in the autum semester of thier life , they made thier mind about the most crucial thing in life , they took desicions and they are handling life more maturely , they are le motivated , but more aware . what am trying to do is to shed more light on the mentality and the status of people at different stage of thier life although it doesnt effect or interact with how much they enjoy their life . but , in my opinion , what doe effect the level of happiness , pleasure or enjoyment in life differs from one individual to another , it is totally related to one perception of life and his prioreties and goal . how much did i achieved till now ? what i want from life ? what i need in life ? do i have it ? we ask ourselves these question all the time . so , doe young people enjoy life more that older people ? ! not really . to sum up must say that people enjoy life regerdless of thier age . thus what doe make the difference is not the age , it is the individual personality and it look towards life , it achievments and the level of sucess and failure .
