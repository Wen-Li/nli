learning is a never ending process . but it is very important for one to know `` how much to know '' . putting forth my disagreement for the statement i would like to present my opinion about the topic . in my opinion having knowledge of many academic subject is fairly justified to a very primary level , till the time one get 's to know the basic of that subject . but it is very important to have detailed knowledge about one subject in particular . to elaborate this point further i would like to detail the factor of one aptitude that come into play . it is not necessary for a person to have strong affinity for a whole array of subjets than compared to a subject in particular . this affinity can be potentially put to use by furher breeding one liking for a paticular subject . this can only be achieved by gaining detailed knowledge about that specific subject . lets take an example of a creative field like architecture , where the primary education that the syllabus provides give one a rough idea about lot of subject pertaining to history , evolution and practical implication of architectural design . but the entire course focus and deal with these subject at a very primary level . the amount of contribution a good architect can make to the society can be very crucial in defining the era a society come from and to be in a position to make that level of contribution and ha to have a very deep rooted understandng of the stratum of society , the nature and behavorial pattern of people . and this can be achieved only when one understands the nuance of a subject in concern . this not only provides a zest and encouragement to do better but can set example for the comming generation . this understanding ha to be inculcated at a very nascent stage so that right decision can be taken by individual which broadens the horizon not only for one personal development but could lead u into a refined and a resolved tommorow .
