my personal belief is that learning fact is more important and helpful in life than understanding concept . first , is it clear that a person who ha learnt a lot of fact , in a word who ha a great experience , adapts more easily to new situation than the one who first try to understand the underlying cause of this event . the former is able to imitate what he ha already seen or done himself and to react quickly whereas the latter need time to think it over and build his behaviour . coming back to the cause of anything to understand the hidden mechanism of action is starting from scratch every time and a hugh loss of time . it is a if you do n't trust what others have done before in similar situation . a lack of trust is basically a kind of anxiety that prevents from adapting to unforeseen event . second , knowing past fact increase one 's action effectivity . finding a solution is quicker when comparing to a similar problem that ha already occurred than when modelising it into abstract scheme . now one could argue that experience is of little help to solve problem that are completely new and that one would be more successful if he understands the cause of the problem . well on the contrary , i believe that experience stimulates creativity and that it can inspire new solution for new problem . third , learning fact is getting a realistic approach to life . focusing on idea and concept is too abstract in my view . of course this is can be seen a a superficial understanding of life but at least this brings liveliness and pragmatism . and living is all about reactivity and ability to get in contact and communication with others . understanding deep cause of action is too theoretical and may cut counication sometines .
