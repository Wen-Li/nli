this can be true or false . it depends on how you see it . you can think that in few year time car will desapear because we will use other kind of transport such a train or plane to travel far away or the bus and the bicycle to go around the city . nowadays more and more people are conserned with the environment so in my opinion , there will be a large increase on the people who will use other kind of transport in state of car . on the other hand , it is true that sometimes it is the most cheaper , confortable and quicklier way to travel because you can take it when ever you want , with the people you want and go exackly to the place you want to go . because this reason i think there wo n't be fewer car in twenty year time . now i am studying to have my driving licence and there is a lot of people like me because it ha been a thing that everybody need not only to go on big trip but also to go to work or to university when you do n't have bus . to conclude i will say that the thing i supposes it is going to happen is that people will continue using their car like today or more but the car will be environmentanly friendly so they will consume le petrol than now or they wo n't consume it . maybe they will use solar energy . this would be grate . so last but not least i need to say that i expect myself in twenty year which a solar car traveling around the world and looking that everyone ha his car .
