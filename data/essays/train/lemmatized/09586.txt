i definitely agree with the statement that young people enjoy their life much more than that the older people do . but there are few people who can enjoy happily at their older age also . the main factor why youg people enjoy a lot wa , their mind may not be much matured , their will be very le problem to face when we are in the childhood stage , and also they were attracted by many thing . firstly when young people enter to their school or collage they feel very happy they make a lot of friend and they would spend a lot of time by chatting to them differant thing such a foot ball match which take place in few day back , and they also spend lot of time in the play ground are at cinema theater , and many other place they tried to enjoy a lot because their would be not much problem sorrounding them , their is no need earn money either their is no need to do a job , and even though a student is going for a part time job he like to enjoy the weekands a lot . secondly when people are young they attracted to several thing such a riding a car , going to new film , attracted to a new fasions or style . people at their young age they would be attracted to a lot of thing , childreans mainly spent a lot of time by playing vedio game daily . they will be attached to their tv set long time . and many people like playing outdoor game such a football , rugby , cricket so on . young people spend lot of time in enjoying their daily life . finally most of the young people spend their most of the time to enjoy only , but in the end of the day they should realise that they should work hard in the present day then only they can build their happy feauters . if they spend all the time by playing , watching tvs they can not survive in they meare feauter they should face many problem , so every student should ellocate some time to study and plan their feauters .
