nowadays we can watch at television a great deal of advertisement for a lot of product . consequently , we can wonder whether the product we see at television are really good or not . i totally disagree with advertisement because they turn people to be stupid . most people buy product only because they have seen them at television and think that they are good . most of time the product are not really so good . for example , there are a lot of advertisement for food whereas everybody know that these product are very bad for one 's health . that is why i think that advertisement is really a con and is here only to attract naive people and so that businessmen might make a lot of money on those poor people . moreover , in my opinion most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . western country are living under the reign of money . money attracts money , that is capitalism and this is one of the reason why advertisement exists . in the other hand , food scandal are more or le the consequence of advertised product . for example , i can quote the foot and mouse disease or the mad cow 's disease . it can also be added that because of the bad quality of certain product , some unscrupulous people dare to send these '' rubbish '' to lower developped country and it is a shame
