i do not think it a good idea to take a group trip led by a tour guide . i have to admit that there are some advantage of this stye of travelling . there are no troublesome decision making , no worry about nasty trouble , and most importantly , it is cheap . actually , i used to make use of this when i wa an university student . but now i realized that a group trip is simply boring and is not worth paying even little money . i will give two reason for my opinion . firstly , you can not fully enjoy your travel , unless you explore the town by your self . the good part of taking a trip lie in the point that you might come across strange and new thing and people in a new environment . you can find out an unknow part of yourself and some new perspective on life itself . if you take a group trip , however , you can not appreciate this point , since you are always bound up by the tight schedule . secondly , you could easily end up buying load of unattractive good at the extraordinary high price , if you join a group tour . as is well know , the reason why a group tour is cheap is that it ha a strong connection with local shop . when i went to chine in a group tour , i wa so annoyed by shop assistant desperately selling expensive good with their fluent japanese . it definitely ruined the great part of my pleasure in the trip . for these reason , i hate taking a group trip led by a busy and materialistic tour guide . even if i had the chance to visit a primitive island where there are nobody who can help me , i would not chose a guiding tour .
