some people said that young people enjoy life more than older people do , i think i agree this statement . there are many reason to support my opinion , first of all , since young people often own a younger and `` fresh '' heart , so in them eye , everything are shining and intresting , they have many hope so they want to try everything in their younger time , by this way , thay could have more changse than old people , even through they could make some mistake , but those mistake still can became young people 's valuble esperents , like poeple said , there are always a thread by sunshine under the dark cloud , the sunshine always come and gose in a secound , to keep up hope is how can make the sunshine stay . secondly , young people were able to get more new idea or messege than older people , thay brave to make more new way to sove problem , by this way , they can enjoy the fresh feeling too , so it make young people enjoy the life . moreover , whit the time going on , more and more involution come into people ' life , for instance , computer , internet , ktv and so on , those thing offere more change to young people enjoy their life . fanilly , besause older people had a full life , so maybe they fell tired , so they want quite and pices rather than `` try '' , it is so different with young peolpe . in one word , in my opinion , young people have more energe than older people to enjoy their life , and also young people 's body are able to help them to finesh their hope , so i think young people enjoy life more than older people .
