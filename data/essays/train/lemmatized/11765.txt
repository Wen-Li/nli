i disagree with that say that after twenty year there will be fewer of car than today , which can be answered at once without even thinking of reason and someone would say : how we are going to move ? . and after thinking in the sentence , then all the thing and sircumstances around u doesnt agree with this sentence . first , until now the most effective and cheapest way to move from a special place to one another is to use my own car , in which i will be the owner of my self , and i can go from any place to another in conveient and cheap way . and if we think in a different way , like bus or train , then i preffer using my own car to move rather than to use train or bus , especially in short movement , and because of beautiful thing that are exist in car those day , in which you can feel you are at home . the second reason , is that the number of peaple using car those day is increasing , and the need of car is incresing , for example ; before 10 year there wa only one car in my house , but now after we grow up , we need our own car for me , a car for my mother , another for my sister . and that is clear for not only my family , for a lot of family . although , the demand of doing thing quickly ask u for more car . the final reason , a the oil exist , then we will have car to move , especially , car age now is 100 year , and the technology of prodction car is now 100 year , so what can come in car place and do what car do with the same quality , the same luxury , the same performane with le problem . although , is it possible to find peaple to deal with any new technology within 20 year ? in a conclusion , i can say that it imposible to abanden car if there is not anything better to take car place , especially we didnt hear any reasercher come with anythin new to take car place . also , i think that the use of car is incresing , and will continue incease .
