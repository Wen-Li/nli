young people enjoying life today i 'm going to right about my opinion about people enjoying there life more when they are younger . i think there are two main resons that support my opinion , the first one is that when you are younger you have alot le responsebelty than you do when your younger . the secound one will be that when you are younger you have so many new experiance 's to do that you will never find the time to do it when you are a grown up person . in this paragraph i 'm going to talk more about the first reson . when you are a child you can enjoy life a mush a you can . for example you can play some soccer for so many hour without thinking about other stuff to do later on ( no responsebelty ) . you can also gather with your friend alot because they also dont have anything to do like you , but when your older you wont be able to stay with them not even a half the time you used to do , but in the same time no one can live like a child all his your you must have some responsebelty 's later on this is how life is . regarding the secound opinion when you are a small kid you have so many new experiances to explode even if they are wrong someone will tell you maybe your dad , mom , ets ... , so baseicly you dont get in so mush truble becuase of your age not like when you do when your old . but anouther disadvantage is that you dont think before you do stuff and if there is no one to put you in the right way you are going to grow up in a wrong way . finally after talking about young people have fun more than older people it only an opinion . like this kind of subject you can never say if your wrong or right it an opinion issue . so i hope that who ever read my opinion that he like what i said . at the end of a day you can never stop having fun so it doe n't matter if you are young or old .
