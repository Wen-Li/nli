it seems to me that young people spend time on something they enjoy at the moment , but that doe not mean that young people enjoy life mroe than older people . in my opinion , older people enjoy their life more than young people do . my father , who is 57 year old and have life time job , seems enjoying the life more than my younger brother , who is 15 year old and still attending school . there are some reason why i think that way . my younger brother go to school everyday , yet he still have more time to spend on whatever he want to do . is he enjoying his life ? the answer is no . he is often worried about the future and all the problem he ha to face in order to succeed in the future . he still ha no idea what he would become later in life , and there are many concern to achieve what he want to be . on the other hand , my father work at the company and he is busy all the time . it seems that he ha no spare time to spend but he is enjoying the life very much . he is more experienced than my younger brother and have more knowledge . when it come to the question of whether person is enjoying the life or not , i believe it is a lot to do with their experience . when you are older and more experienced , handling problem would be easier than when you have to face one in young age . since for my father , his life goal a to get the job that he want and have family is already achieved , he ha no concern about his future . therefore he can enjoy life much better than my younger brother because he ha no concern about life that it make the life more enjoyable . in conclusion , the case of family is not always true for every old people and young people . some people are able to achieve their goal when they are still young and perhaps such young people enjoy life more than some old people who is still struggling to achieve the goal . despite those case , i believe that older people enjoy life more than young people do .
