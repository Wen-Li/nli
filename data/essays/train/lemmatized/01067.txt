when we talk about traveling a lot of thing come to our mind like price , place to visit , time to expend in such place and if is good to be led by a tour guide or not . i think the best way to travel is by oneself , without a tour guide . there are many reason that support my idea . for example oneself could visit other place not offered in the tour , design their own schedule , and skip non interesting place . in a tour the guide take their group of tourist to an especific place , already planned by the travel agency . in contrast , without a tour guide oneself could go wherever he/she want . for instance , i traveled to toronto and i found interesting travel to place by myself . i had the chance to talk to people from the city and ask them the best place to visit from their point of view , they know better than tour guide . in a planned tour , the tourist have an schedule to follow . i prefer to plan my own schedule , according to my interest and necesities . for example , what if i want to go and relax all day on the beach . if i have the chance to elaborate my schedule . i can adjust my plan to visit other place in order to get what i want . finally , some tour agency have tour plan to visit place that are important to certain type of people . i went to visit florida for my vacation and i had bad luck because i traveled with a group of old people . they were not interested in visit place like busch gardens or exiting theme park like universal studios . they just wanted to stay at the beach , or go to quiet place . if i would traveled by myself without a tour guide , i would visited theme park with those exiting roller coaster , or visited beach full of young woman . in general , i consider a better option to travel without a tour guide . the experience is more exiting and suit to oneself interest . therefore , oneself could visit place interesting for the person instead of place interesting for the tour agency , create their own schedule and skip `` boring '' place to other more interesting .
