the question that who enjoys most ; an older person or a young lad , is debatable . on one hand older person are said to be wise and experienced that they take everything seriously while on the other hand younger one are called a the care free . they are seen enjoying life a none other doe . in my view it the younger generation who enjoy their life . there are difficulty in life which every one ha to suffer and solve . at the tender age the child are totally free from tension and play within themselves unaware of the worldly problem . till the age of teen the main task to them is to study and make the building block of future life . they enjoy their every moment while studying , interacting with new friend and preparing for their next school class . next stage is the time of earning and spending for themselves . these people go to theater and enjoy art . they go to party and keep them themselves aloof of the responsibility . dancing to the tune of saturday night and summer of 69 . riding bike and car and doing whatever they want . while on other hand older people get workoholic . they work most of the time and find it hard to spare time for them and for their family . in run to earning the living to live and fulfill the need . older people cover most of their life in similar fashion getting themselves engaged in monotonous routine of office to home and home to office . after a certain age they have time and money to do whatever they like but what lack is that they do not have the energy and company to do thing of their choice . retirement life brings again a life of boring routine where they find no one to talk to . thus instead of enjoying thier life they become even more tensed . various disease and ailment also contribute to their tension . so from the above point discueed i believe that the best time to enjoy life is the young age . younger generation extraxt the enjoyment most from their life .
