first of all , i disagree with the statment . i prefer to have a travel in group all my by ourselves . the reason that i disagree with the statment are , first , i will have le freedom on my trip . basically , going for a trip is a way to relax and have more private room for ourselves . so a led who usually is usually a stranger could interrupt our privacy . second , the tour guide may usually misleading u to some place where we are not willing to go . for example , if we are hoping for somewhere for excitments . by mostly , the tour guide may usually get u to some place purpose for shopping or those typical place for sightseeing which may probably cant fulful our wish . maybe you may doubt that what if we are not able to led our way when going to somewhere that we never been to ? of course , this will be hard to go . at this point , i will first suggest u to join with the tour guide for your first trip . because during the trip , you will get some of their advice and knowledge to help you go by yourselves in the future . when after that trip , you will be able to go for a trip all by yourselves . and , you will have chance to discover more excitments without the tour guide . going travel without any tour guide could be fun . there must be more unkowns and unpreditable result finally . during the travel , all disicions all make by ourselves and the time controlling ha no limit . we are able to stay or leave whenever we want . every moment we are having is great and exciting , becaus . and this is the main purpose to go travel . to explore , to experience , to taste the life .
