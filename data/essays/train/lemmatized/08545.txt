i completely agree with the statement . out of my own experience , i can say that it is much better to understand the idea and concept behind a certain topic . it make no sense to learn fact only be heart without understanding the real content and sense . when you simply learn something without really understanding it , you are likely to forget everything soon . after a few week , you will not be able to memorize what you have learned anymore . but when you really understand the idea and the concept , you will probably remember it much longer or even a life long . i experienced that phenomenon myself . it is now nearly one year ago that i passed my `` abitur '' . and i have to submit that i forgot a lot . .. things i learned by heart for instance in biology have disappeared nearly completely . but on the other hand , i can remember almost everything in math . that 's because i really understood the concept behind all these math operation . in my opinion , it is a shame that you learn so hard and in the end you forget everything again . that can not be the objective of effective learning ! so the only conclusion from this can be that it is essential to understand what you are learning . at the moment , i 'm studying business studies and in order to use all the concept i learn at university ( like audit method , accountibility , portofolio diversification etc . ) in my later job , it is important that i understand them . there is no other way ! you can only be good and successful when you know what you are actually doing . consequentely , i can only recommend everyone not to simply learn thing by heart . that make no sense ! teachers should support this idea a well . they should n't ask their pupil to learn fact and figure , but to understand the thing they have thought them .
