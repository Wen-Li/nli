i think that every age ha a different joy throughout a human 's life . young seem to do more activity and anjoy a lot but this doe not mean that older people do n't enjoy living . they also have fun but in their own way . young people have le responsibility so they are more careless . they only try to spend their time enjoying themselves . they live for the moment without thinking about past or future . they have more energy so they get involved in physical and outdoor activity such a sporting game , concert , party and park more often . they are much resistable and strong which let them to be able to take more risk . during school year there would be a lot of friend around to spend time together . on the other hand , a people get older they take more responsibilty so they change . usually , after school they start working and later they get married . they become more mature and they learn to enjoy life in other way . they may not go to party , take risk or have a plenty of friend but having success in work , maintaining a happy family , having a pleasant dinner with old , trustful friend are joy of life that ca n't be replaced with anything . as people grow they see the world from a wider perspective so life becomes more meaningful and tasteful . humans may get older and may have some disability because of age by time but living with good memory and seeing their grandchild is much valuable than going into pub . in summary , in my point of view it is very superficial to think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . people enjoy every stage of life if they live a successful and honored life . people should live their life in a way that when they look behind they should not regret anything .
