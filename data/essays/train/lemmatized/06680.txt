advertisments are helped the product to sell and advertiser trying to make a spical advertisment to their product . i 'm agree with this state `` most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are. '' advertiser are using some materels in thier advertisment to buy attintion from the audions . advertisment is the way to make the give succesful product . some advertisres use the advertisment because thier product are in the store . no one buy it even if it is good or bad product . for that they make the advertisment to this product . some company are used some popular people in thier advertisments to make a nice influnce in the costomers from thier product . for example , if britny make advertisment for coca cola company , 90 % pf people will buy coca cola instade of pepesi . the advertisment let the poeple to buy the product without knowing what doe it have . for example , when i wa young , i saw the advertisments about smoking . after a time , i started smoking a ciggret becuase the ciggret advertisment and i still somke until now . the point here is we buy some product without knowing what doe it have . in the conclution , avdvertisment is the way to succesed our broducts . the problem is the advertisments make the product seem better than they really are . we have to buy with our brain not with our felling .
