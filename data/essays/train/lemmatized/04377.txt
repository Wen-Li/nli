i do agree to the statement , that the undestanding of idea and concept is more important than to learn fact , but only to a certain extend . concepts and idea are structure , which are very versatile , what mean that the student is able to solve problem by himself using these thinking pattern , that make him independent . understanding of idea is in my opinion also very important when it come to have own one 's , because if a scientist had never undestood formulars , instead of just learning them , their could have never been any progress . another example is the way of thinking , that student learn in school , and when i say that , i mean the critical thinking , to question thing , and to take nothing for granted , which is a concept , a concept of thinking , which allows the student to work with in every job or part of life , it is the basis . therfore i do agree , that concept and idea are of great importance , but they could not exist without fact , that have to be learned simulantiously . questioning is good , but we need a knowledge , to be able to question something , and that knowledge of fact need to be learned . for exmaple , how could someone dicuss the meaning or the intent of literature if he had no knowledge about the time , the piece wa written in , or about the author or the genre ? in my opinion , concept , idea and fact do only unfold their full usefulness and reasonablity , when they go hand in hand , so that the owner of these ability can create idea , based on fact and worked out with concept .
