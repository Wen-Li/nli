young people today do not seems to care much about their community and do little to help them . the young generation seem to be too busy studying , working or relaxing to spend time for their community , but it is not only their fault . it is also the fast changing world that brought them to this stage , they do not seem to have time for anything but their own business . this is also because of the technological development that changed our life by making thing quicker and filling our day with more and more task to accomplish instead of keeping their number constant and giving u more time for ourselves or our community . the result is that at the end of the day we are a lot more stressed and tired and only care of relaxing . a good example is mobile phone that make u reacheble for work matter even while taking a walk in the park after office hour , often there is no clear cut between work and private life . young people are normally those who take innovation more seriously and so they are the one that always find something to do , no matter wheter it is useful or not , they are just not able to stop for a second . society today is also more self-centered : people is aiming more at personal success and wealth and this of course brings people away from dedicating time to their community because in their mind every second of time is precious for themselves and somebody else can take care of the community . if this is the stereotype of the modern man , it is also going to be the model for young people and since they are smart and very quick at learning ( thanks also the higher average level of education ) they will lose no time and forget about the community . it is easy to find evidence of this a always le people volunteer to work for charity , hospital and church , but we can also notice it in the little thing : so many people throw paper in the street like they do not care because somebody will clean it sooner or later , this is a sign of missing respect to the community and it is jut like not dedicating time to it since the environment is also part of the community . young people really do not know what it mean to dedicate time to their community because they hardly ever do , they look at it ha a waste of time and this is mainly because of the changing modern culture .
