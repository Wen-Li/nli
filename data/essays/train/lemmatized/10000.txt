nowadays , some people think that it is more important to understand idea and conceps than it is to learn fact . as far a i am concerned , i think it should be better to learn fact especially for student . in the following line , i will developp my point of view . firstly , idea and conceps are not always true . they can often be based for example on myth or on rumor . in that way , if student fixe on an idea or a concept that is not true their education may not be right . that is it is important for student to learn fact . because by learning fact , they can discovering by themself that what they are learning is true . they will first start by a statement or a situation , analyse it and find why it is in that way . secondly , learning fact is more adapted in an academic environment . thirdly , learning in fact provide more information to student than learning idea or concept . for example , a concept is something that is already stated and your professor would only explain it to you . but if you learn fact , you will have certainly informatins from your professor but also you will get your own new information due to your discovery . to conclude , i can assert that learning fact in better for student than learning idea or concept because it provides more advantage to student .
