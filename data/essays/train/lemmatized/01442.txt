most of people use car a a part of their daily life for travelling . there are other way of travelling like moter cycle , aeroplane and train but these way of travelling have it own drawback . consider the case of motercycles : these are felt useful only when travelling distance le than 10 km . if the distance increase we feel uncomfortable with motercycles . moreover people see car a a status symbol consider the case of travelling by mean of train : teh train timmings are fixed and are not flexible to our reruirements and the facility are not htat much good in all train . we must be there at station strictly by time if we are littile bit late we will miss required train consider the case of travelling by mean of aeroplane : though the facilitie s in plane are good it is suitable only for travelling larger distance that is more than 200 km and more over cost of travelling by plane is not affordable to every one and timmings are not flexible to our requirement . construction of airport requires huge land and capital now consider the benfits by travelling in our own car : firstly the timmings are flexible to our requirement . we fell more comfortable in car than motercycle or train . it also reflect our status . in country like india people strive for status and most of the people buy car to show their status . more over in car around four people can travel at a time saving travelling fare . we can travel to rural area were travelling by train or plane is not possible . we can enjoy reading book magazine novel etc and listening to music sitting in seat behind driver . we can even watch movie traveling in car . we can stop at any place we want . more over complete all our work which are in the route by travelling in car which is not possible in case of travelling by train . thats why i agree to the statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewer in use than there are today ''
