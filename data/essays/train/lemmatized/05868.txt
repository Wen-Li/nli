although older people may enjoy their retirement and have gained a great amount of moneyto spend , i prefer to experience the life a a young person usually do . in the first place , young people do not have to deal with many illness . they are healthy and can spend their life with activity . for example , they join sport club or enjoy bungee jumping while older people may have to deal with cancer and have to stay at home or in hospital . second , patterning your further life appear to be an interesting stage of life . as a young adult one decide on studying or making an apprenticeship with a company . this decision-making process affect one 's whole future . beside that young people choose a marriage partner and search friend , who they may have contact with the rest of their life . consequently this period is very exciting and requires much engagement ; however , it offer the great opportunity to choose from all the option , which lay in one 's ability . third , there probably would never be a time , in which one can so easily make new friend . for example , i a a student met so many different people at university and sustain the possibility to learn from them or experience a whole new culture . i a a student for example have amazing friend from turkey and spain . beside that one can spend time with attending party and joining club offered by university or another organization . finally , young people are mostly only responsible for their own life and can decide on everything without caring about husband , wife or child . this offer a significant background for self-realization . during this beneficial time a student maybe choose to study abroad , an option which will offer both , personal and academic enrichment . consequently , i enjoy being a young person with all option but le responsibility and an interesting freetime
