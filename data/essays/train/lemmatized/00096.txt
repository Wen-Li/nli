i disagree with the statement that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is better than travelling individually without any form of guidence . my opinion is based on my past vacation experience and my personal preference in regard to organize my vacation time . travelling in a group ha the advantage that the traveller is instantly surrounded either by people he or she know or by other traveller with the same time schedule and intention . this eliminates the pressure to meet people for the purpose of socializing during vacation . furthermore , hiring or electing a tour guide waif the responsibility to plan and organize time schedule , sleeping arrangement and sight seeing trip to a third person . this reduces the stress and organizational effort prior to and during vacation . on the other hand , it limit the individual possibility to plan the vacation time according to my own and my fellow traveller 's preference . group trip are rather advantageous for shorter trip . whereas over the period of several day , individual personality tend to create minor or major conflict within the group . this is especially true for pretty heterogeneous group , ranging in age , profession , personal background , etc . whereas the excitement at the beginning of trip cause most people to subordinate their own preference to the group 's interest , this is likely to change over the course of a vacation . frustration , argument , and annoyment are only some example of negative personal conflict that i saw occuring during group trip in the past . and these can severely ruin the enjoyment of a vacation . based on my experience , tour guide have to the potential to limit the personal freedom to visit attraction that i wanted to see and group dynamic can have a negative impact on all member of the travel group . therefore , i prefer to travel individually . the freedom to create a schedule according to my preference and to choose who to interact and socialize with during my vacation offset the extra organizational effort prior to the trip . by travelling individually , the success and enjoyment of my vacation is in my own hand .
