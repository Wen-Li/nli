it is said that young people enjoy life more than older people . personally , i agree with this saying for two reason . one , young people like to explore new stuff , and learn about it . second reason , young people have more energy than older people . first , young people like to eplore new stuff like place . people like to explore new stuff , and see new thing . for exaple , when i watch something that i like , i tell my self , i want to try that thing , and i do . older people on the other hand , like to quistion every thing before doing it . one time i saw one of my friend riding a four wheel motercycle . i seid to my self `` i want to try that motercycle '' , so i stoped him , a nd told him that i wanted to ride with him on his motercycle . if i were an older man , i would n't of done that . second , younger people have more energy to do stuff . for exaple an older man or woman would not like to try skating . however younger people love skating , and they will try it even if they do n't know how to . as a fact , lately i have been travling alot , i travel in economy class , no matter how tired i git , because thats more fun than first class . in conclusion , older people , and younger people should learn how to enjoy life like it should be . pleasure dose n't know what you are . so enjoy your life , and live it to the fullest , old and young people . however in my country , an old man or an old woman is very respicted . so , when poeple see an older man having fun in a place where teenager are having fun too , people tend to think that that old man is living a teenager life , which is not very good .
