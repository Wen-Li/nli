who enjoys life more young poeple or old one . it is very important for u to enjoy our time in our life span owing to the fact that we fell positive and happy if we only enjoy our time . people often claim that young people enjoy life more than old people however i am inclined to belive that , old people can enjoy just a the same levvel or more/i have many reason to belive so . to start with according to me young people spend good time which is true they do not have many responsibelties , they can make many sport , ride their bike and the like but they are also in the term of their like they have being educated . i thing that this is a very hard time of one life they have to obbey to rule , to be dissipline which can be gloomy and sad . in this term of their life they do not have the apportunety to chose what they want . they are in control of their parent or their theachers . according to me , adult have the ability to chose what they want to do whicw is the most significant issue according to me . fredom is something which we enjoy in life naturely and instinctly . aspecialy if we choose a job that we tend to or have talend on i can not see any reason which can take an adult to be unhappy / taking everything in to accoud , i strongly belive that adult can also enjoy their life just a young one do or much more by chooseng the right job and controlling their self . working , earing money and spending it on something they enjoy .
