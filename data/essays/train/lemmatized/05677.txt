before going into medias race , i would like to show up some dependency a there are nature , recouces in term of engery like oel and human oppinion and fashion etc . if they all stay a they are at the moment ( no increase of katastrophes , alternative engeries , and having a car will still be a previlige and not unfeshioned ) car in use will be found in far bigger number in twenty year . sice scientist and examination say the world wide oel-recources will last formore than 50 year and we still wo n't have any opportunity to car , there will be much more car in use than today . one reason is , that pruducer release one new model after another in marginal peroides . nad that often in competition with other brand . an other point is that used , demolished and old car are not dumped but resold or shiped to some poor country , where they 're beeing rebuild to run for many year . at the same time population is increasing and more costomers get on the market , what also will have an effect on the number of car in use . if humanity is not changing it perspective of using car instead of some other , might be future way of transportation we 'll end in the picture i painted above . cars are our all favorite way of getting from one point to another , so we wo n't change out of a free will . in mz oppinion the only way to reduce number of car is to put tax ie . on them , or at least on the gazoline thez use . on practical example migth be calefornia , where gouvener schwarzenegger try with these method to get hold of the car - and with it the enviromental problem .
