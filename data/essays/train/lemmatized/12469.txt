i agree with this statement because i believe that who dare win . i basically think that doing only what we already know can be the starting point of a career but if we limited ourselves to it for our whole life , we can not achieve success . there are several reason why i agree with the above statement . firstly , i think that success is the outcome of creativity . if we see all the most important business men , for example briatore , we realize that they had to risk and start an activity without thinking about failure . all this obviously start from an interest , in this case briatore wa interested in formula 1 , but in my opinion he needed creativity to make an interest become a business . secondly , success is not a daily goal , on the contrary it is something really difficult to achieve , therefore it need not only knowledge but even the ability of a person to take risk . a a matter of fact , success is something that probably last for only a certain period of time and for this reason , i think that all the successful people are not scared of failure , they are aware of it . the pleasure of success is probably more important than the fear of a failure . thirdly , successful people have often some difficulty in their private life , because they do not have enough time to dedicate to their family , to their friend and partner although these are some very important aspect of a person existence . this reason support the opinion that a successful person must have the ability to take risk . a a matter of fact someone that doe not want to run any risk , will unlikely manage to achieve success . in conclusion , successful people must have the curiosity to try new thing , and the hability to take risk from an economical point of view but , above all , from a personal and private point of view .
