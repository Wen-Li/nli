the scholar system give u a global sight of the main subject in sciences , litterature , music , sport and other to allow u to find our way . when we are young it is very useful to try a lot of subject but when you grow up thing change . now i am not anymore interested in playing music or doing mathematics exercices so i am naturally going to specialize in what i like . thus i believe that is better to specialize in one specific subject . first of all , i really want to know more about a subject which really interest me a the economists . so it is obvious that i am an economy student at university . although i have already spent three year in that study and i think that is more and more interesting . my knowledge in economy ha increased a lot but i still want to learn more , i already know a lot of the main theory of economists a karl marx , adam smith , keynes . thus those knowledge are very useful for my study , it allow me to make my own economy theory . the second reason why i think is better to be specialized is to be a specialist in the economy field . i want to teach order to transmit my knowledge to the new generation of student and to make them attract by economy research to improve nowadays life . in my field i think most of the student are not really interested in economics that what i want to change in the future , i want student to love economics in the same way i do . to conclude it is better to specialize in one specific subject and now i want to be specialized in economy of developpment to help developping country to have a better standard of living and to get out of poverty . economy influence many kind of political , environmental 's decision so it is actually very important to understand the main mechanism of how doe the economy occurs .
