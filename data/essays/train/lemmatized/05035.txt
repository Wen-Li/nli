everyone want to be successfull . however cooking a pitza is not a success . the question is ` which accomplishment is a success ? ` . an accomplishment is called success when it is something rare . success come from trying and working for new , risky and higher level accomplishment . first of all , a successfull person can not be the model of an old successfull person . for example an architect build an extra-ordinary building and create a new approach which is second to none in his area . an other architect read many article about the above mentioned approach and build a new building with the same style , or approach . which one would you like to call successfull ? of course the first one . secondly , accomplishing something which is already accomplished by someone else is not success . take the risk and try something harder ! as an example , one racer finish the race in 5 minute . if the other one want to be successfull then he should risk his life and drive faster . moreover , in pc game the player is only successfull when he or she reach the top score , which mean he or she is better than the last player . in contrast , some lazy people argues that doing the thing they know the best is the success . i call them robot . do you see any difference ? robots are doing what they can do the best . they are of course successfull in being a robot , however not a successfull human . all in all , in my opinion there is a big difference between success and accomplishment . success is the new , risky and top level accomplishment . only doing what you already know how to do is next to nothing .
