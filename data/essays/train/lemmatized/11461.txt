ideas consist of fact , and the relation between the two concept is of a complicated kind . indeed , when we read the statement , it seems natural to argue that understanding idea is of a better use that to merely learn fact . the first is considered a such a noble and deep endeavor whereas the second is depicted a a narrow minded attitude . though we shall not come to conclusion of this kind in such a precaucious manner , and we will strive to analyse the question in a more thoughtfull way . since we would all , i presume , agree that understanding idea is more important than learning fact , we should then rather that argueing in this sense , try to explain why this answer seems so obvious and natural . why then , would we all , certainly , tend to value the firts idea and not the second one . this a priori , that we all share derives from the fact that we strongly believe that the activity of learning fact requires le of an effort than the one of understanding . this belief is widely spread , and it is shared for many good reason . understanding undoubtadly requires more time and concentration that the learning of fact . yet , most profession , now day , give more importance to act then they do to thought and deepness . to pas this test , we are not asked to truely understand the question that we are asked but simply to answer them in a superficial way . most of u have little or no knoledge of biology or of social science and yet , are goal is to sound like excperts and to bring exact answer . again , we are not asked to think neither about the question nor about the reason why we are here to pas the test , wich behavior would result in an immediate failure . but is society mistaken when it askes u to come to this center and pas the test ? no . because we should understand the importance of leraning fact . the two concept meet when the understanding serf our goal .
