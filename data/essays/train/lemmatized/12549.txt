in a lifetime , be successful is very hard and people usually try to be only good at something and not really successful . what is the difference between successful people and the rest of the world ? this question ha to be answered to understand why successful people are so special . if someone said that the key of success is trying new thing , i would strongly agree with this statement , because of many reason . one of the reason for what i agree with this idea is the way you become successful . successful people are special people , which mean they have done something special , something nobody ha done before them . the only way to make something special is trying new thing , which is already a risk to take . for example , a young and beautiful girl want to be a famous model . for what i know , the first step is being noticeable by a photographer , in meaning to be chosen between a large group of beautiful woman . it could be very difficult to do if this young woman doe n't try some new attitude , posture , even when she is n't sure about her move . another reason is that successful people are often venturous . they like venture and that why they can go further . they go over their own limit . once they know how to do something , they always want to learn something else over and over again . according to the `` people '' magazine , most of stars were poor in their childhood . they came from destroyed family , divorced family and all kind of big issue . however , they had the dream of becoming successful , so they decide do to something uncommon . they decided to leave all the thing they already knew , to do something they had n't done before . in conclusion , i think that the risk is the key of success for all successful people .
