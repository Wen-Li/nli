i totally agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , for two simple reason : personally , professionally , first of all , i think in my case i will grow more a a person , meaning that i will study more of many thing , not only concentrating in one specific subject . that make me , in my opinion , more interesting and usefull . for example : reading , which is part of studiying , is so important for u to obtain knowlege , so it will help u through getting all that broad knowlege we want . and eventually we have a lot more opportunity for job , which lead me to my second reason : professionally . this give me such an advantage in getting a job , because i cover many subject , so there are more open opportunity for me out there . it 's good to know many subject because you can be very usefull at not one , but many thing .
