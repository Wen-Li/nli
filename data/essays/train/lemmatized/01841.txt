i definetely agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . it 's the way to sell product for few time . first of all , for making good product , company need to have expensive and good material or thing . doesnt matter what kind of product it is , they do n't want to spend a lot of money on their product . because they want to earn more and everbody know that the best way to sell a product is advertising it . advertisements show these product like they are great . obviously they lie to people . but company doe n't know that it not a good idea to do that . maybe for few time they will earn money more than they expected . however later on , these product lose their popularity . because people understand that this product are not good a they hope . people absolutely know what is good for them . so that company will fall down a fast a it grew up ! it will lose all it money , probably more than it earned from the first time . i think the best way producing product are making it a good a company can . after this , they can advertise it and it will be so successful and popular for the people and actually they can make really good money in that way . i beleive that people must against these kind of product , because we spend our money on lie and nobody give it back to u . maybe if we should against this product that they arent good a adversisements show to u , maybe our grandchildrens wo n't see this kind of lie and bad product . if we against them and not to buy this kind of company product , they will be gone . after that actually we can trust the people . we dont have to think twice before we buy something . the most important point here that i wanna focus on is lying to people . if you lie to someone , even though you will say truth next time , they wont beleive you . the main point is not to think only ourselves . everybody ha to care about other people or even animal too . if do something wrong or not right , one day someone can do it back to u . we never forget this .
