i know lot of older people enjoy life after retired their job or grew up their child because they can have time and money that young people have , so they can do anything they want . however , i agree young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are several reason . first of all , young people are helthy because they are young , so they can be active and cheerful than older people . helthy is very important to do anything . it is easy to get sick or illness for older people that young people . for example , my uncle who had his own bussiness got illness after retired his job . when he wa young he had lot of hobby and he wa enjoying his life . eeven though he wa busy , he did make time to have fun because he wa helthy and very active person . however , since he got sick , it wa hard time to live , even though he had lot of money and time . secondly , young people can have dream more that older people because they can have time to live . older people feel limited to live , but young people never think about their death because they think it would not happen soon . it give young people lot of dream . when people have a dream , they can enjoy the time to acheane it . therefore , for these reason i agree young people enjoy life more than older perople do .
