culture ha to be very important for all people , it is better thet eachone know much information about differet argoment and topic . it is very beatiful study many academic subject because you could discover much thing that you do n't know . at same time i think that for working is better to specialize in one specific subject . for example before the last reform of school italian university give you many academic subject and le specific subject , you study in university a lot of book and after university you do n't know the way for enter in word 's job . for a student is very difficult understanding the application of information in a jo . i think that the general academic subject is important for myself and specific subject too . the best way for me to improve your culture and found a good job is that you have to learn very well all the information that school give you and after that , during the work , this information have to use for do a good job . now italian university is building in a different way than the past . you study for 3 year many academic subject ( many information about a different kind of disciplins ) and the and of this 3 yea you have a degree of first level . after you decide if you continue your study or not . if you continue to study you can choose one specialization and learn one specific subject for 2 year , during this time yuo at the and you have a degree of second level . in short i think that is better that i learn many academic subject for improve my culture and my life at the same time i learn one specific subject for found a job that i like me .
