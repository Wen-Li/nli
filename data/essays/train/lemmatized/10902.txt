in our daily life we encounter advertisement frequently . it start by listening to the radio in the morning , continues on our way to school and doe not end until we switch of the tv or computer at night . advertisment - that is so many thing : billboard , tv spot , commercial and so on . and the reason for it ? well there are two significant reason : for one thing to inform about a product but first and foremost to attract customer to buy the product . in my opinion the majority of advertisement make their product seem prior to it actual status , but in our time of life it seems like it ha to be like that . i am aware of the huge number of product there are for any purpose anyone could have . so therefore i can understand the marketing agent , when they try to get just a little attention for their product . suggerating an impossible result seems like a well-working marketing tool - if the buyer can take it with some humor . red bull for example : the drink is supposed to help you to be able to fly . obviously , consumer know that this promise is over the top , but when this drink first came to market i also thought this idea wa funny and i tried the drink . or take the example of the snickers bar . in a recent tv spot the producer claimed that this chocolate bar would give anyone who ate it magical super power . of course this is not true , but it is a humorous way to attract attention . the only time i think this kind of marketing strategy is not appropriate is for medical supply . in my opinion medical supply , like special technical appliance or medicine ( prescription drug ) should only state the feature of the product that it truly ha . otherwise it would be life-threatning . to sum up i can say that most advertisement make their product seems better than it actually is . but in my opinion everyone should , if he or she is not sure of what the product is really about , get more information and get aware of possible hazard .
