in my experience going to travel with a group led by a guide is much better than any other way . and that because these following reason . enconomic reason . going by group is much le expensive than going a individual becuase the le cost of group transportaion and reservation like hotel any other place . a lso being led by a guide will give more information from his experience about where is the best place to go with the most cheapest price . another point is that going with a group is more fun . really in my experience it is really more fun to have the pleasure of visting new place with a group and also let by the guide . and it give you more information about the region that you are visting because the guide will give you some important inforamtion about the historic place for example that you are visiting . and also you can share and take some expereince from the other memebers in the group . another point to focus on is going by a goup to some place is really more safety than going alone like mountain a an example . since having a memebers in the goup that may help if some thing happend to you is very important and having a tour guide who have the experince to pas these problem is also a basic . the last point which is more interesting and happened to me when i went with my partner to another country without a group is that we really have problem with the communication with the people over there . since the langauge and the custom are not the same , and that will not happened if we had a guide at time who can talk that language . and from that time i advice most the people to go with group letd by a tour guide .
