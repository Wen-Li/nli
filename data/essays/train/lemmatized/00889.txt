even though a travel with a tour guide is more comfortable , safe , convenience , i disagree that it is the best way to travel . there are several reason to support my idea . first , a group travel is not memorable and useful . i experienced both type of trip . when i accompanied with a male guide , he solved every problem and arranged all reservation . therfore , i could spend very peaceful time in japan . however , it did n't give any useful experience to me , and i totally forgot all my trip quickly . on the other hand , i went to china by myself . i reserved my airline ticket and hotel . also , i tried to communicate with chinese people with chinese to find some famous place , to buy gift and to eat traditional food . i met diverse people and learned a lot how to prepare for a trip . sometimes it wa too tired to do anything . however , it wa so exiting and exotic . eventually , i still remember everything in china . therefore , i do not agree with this statement that a group trip is the best way . next , a group travel is fixed . whenever i encounter many new interesting place in other country , i would like to change my schedule . however , it is impossible in a group travel since a guide have to arrange all tourist . in contrast , i can handle my plan accoding to my interest if i travel alone by myself . i can go everywhere i want to . in india , i met a kind woman . she wa interested in my country and me , so she wanted to invite me to her house . i could accept easily her suggestion because i wa alone . i met her husband and her three child , and she prepared very wonderful dinner for me . moreover , i selpt in her house . i experience indian traditional house , and saved my money . for these reason , i think a group travel with a guide is not the best way to travel . even though i may encounter dangerous or strange situation , i prefer traveling alone .
