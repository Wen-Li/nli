what is it to be successful ? it sometimes seems to be unusual , or not normal . when reading bibliography of successful people , they do unusual thigs . they are described a a stupid , annoying , breave but strange human-being . editson wa kicked out of the school because he kept asking a teacher why 1 plus 1 is equl to 2 . soldiers went to war even though they could actually see that the death wa waiting for them . is it true that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know ? does it mean that it is necesssary to have new point of view , try new thing and take risk to be successful ? assume that an apple suddenly fall on someone 's head . what would that person say out right away ? if it were me , i would say ` ouch ! ' but newton said ` why did it fall ? ' here is a significant difference between him and other people . newton wondered why the apple fall to the ground , not floating on the air , while everyone had already accepted it a a natural incident . as soon a he became curious and wondering , he started studying on it . that is what most scientist or inventor usually start their scientifical work . look at king . martin luther . he is very well-known black person who had been arguing about black people 's freedom and right . he must have had suffered a lot of risk while he wa arguing his opinion . not that he wa the only one who wa upset about white people 's unfairness . black people were also a upset a him , but none of them were a brave a him . he is now very famous , historical , heorical person in the history of the world . lastly , soldier in all kind of war . many people took the risk to die in the war , get tortured by enemy , and lose their family . they surely and obviously knew how much risky way they chose to follow . but they did not deny it . they followed it a if it wa what they must have done . historical , famous , well-know , and greatly successful people take risk a if that is what they were born to do . they think differently . they are always willing to try and do new thing rather than following what other people have thought or believed in .
