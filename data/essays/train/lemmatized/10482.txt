the statement say that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . we dont know for sure whether this statement is true or not . twenty year is a long time , and anything can happen . with all the new technology that are being invented everyday , it is possible to have fewer car in twenty year . today , we see that there are too many car being manufactured than the amount that is needed . in kuwait for example , every house ha about two to three car , if not more . having too many car can cause disaster . as a result , more accident will occur , and people would have to leave their home earlier because of any traffic or accident that would cause them to be late . in twenty year , we could have flying car , or a different trasportation system that would result in le car . more people might start using other form of transportation . in my opinion , i believe that there should be le car in use , and that people should use other form of transportation to get from one place to another . some other form of transportation are the use of bus , subway , or carpooling . if more people used bus and subway , there would be le car in use . carpooling is also a good method that can be used to reduce the amount of car in use today . if there wa a rule stating that each car should have a minimum of three people , le car would be in use . in conclusion , a possible solution is that in the future , people would realize the amount of money they are spending on gas , and how dangerous driving ha become . and who know how much gas will be available in twenty year .
