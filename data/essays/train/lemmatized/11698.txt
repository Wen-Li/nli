since the last century , the world ha been undergoing a globalisation movement . capitalism ha spread over the planet and new society considered a individualistic ha been settled down . more and more people seems to be more interested in their own success , their own life than in what could occur in the society . but can we say that people , or especially young people are not interested or involved anymore in community problem ? saying that young people are not interested in helping the community would be a wrong statement . it just ha to be considered that to help the community you have to know what is needed and where you can do it . young people of today are often student , but also sometimes young worker or unemployed people . these are three differents status that doe not offer to intergrate the community in the same way . most of the student are involved in their community life within activity in their school or university . young worker have to work more on it with discovering association and community service by themselves . unemplyed young people are often already in contact with community association .
