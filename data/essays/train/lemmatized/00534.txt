i agree successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because of several reason . first of all , successful people are possible to learn and realize various thing in their life and then they get the lot of information and knowledge through their trying to new thing . for example , the person to try to new thing and take risk can prospect and see the different field with his or her experience . on the contrary , the person not to try to new thing and take risk can not prospect and see different field and also he or she may be embarassed or surprised these circumstance because of no experience . in fact , only few people having the experience about new thing and risk can be possible to know the skill , like a `` how to do this dangerous position '' , `` how to manage some risk '' a `` the statistic of the management ability in the dangerous environment . '' actually , lot of successful people know this fact and they try to new thing in their various place or condition . second , people should be learned and experienced time to time because enviroment ha chaged and rapidly developed a technology . for instance , the person working for the computer science company specially is required the new skill and ability a the improvement of technology . finally , i agree this .
