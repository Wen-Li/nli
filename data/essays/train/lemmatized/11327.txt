i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . as we all know , technology and science is developing quickly nowadays . so there is a big market on producting and consuming on car . how could human being can drop this golden opportunity to make money ? fisrt , if you live in a big city with a car available , you can easily get to the destination where you want to be . you do n't need to get on crowded bus and waste a long time just for waiting bus ' coming . for example , in the late evening if you have something urgent and also we know that it is really hard to get a taxi or bus , then at that moment you got a car , your problem will be soon solved . second , now car are invented in different style and even you can choose what content in it . so they are access to your need such a high-quality stero inside the car . then you can enjoy the music during your driving . and more and more car will be produced by car factory . the price of car must be dropped to the level that ordinary people can afford it . finally , new energy are being invented by scientist . they will soon be used instead of petrol and gasoline . that is to say that car will scarcely pollute our environment . so we do n't need to worry about those gas such a carbon dioxide and acid rain which destroy atmosphere and constructures of our city . all in all , we can clearly see that how a car is convenient to our life . my friend always proud of that their can drive a car and they are very addicted to the enjoyment of process in driving . so we can infer that there will be more and more people who are willing to buy their own car and that will promote our country 's develpment .
