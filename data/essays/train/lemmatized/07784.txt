it is generally belived that the young people in today are le interested in their neighbor than previously . althogh some young people still spent their time on helping their community , in my opinion young people do n't enjoy their time spend with their community no more because of development of technology and competitive education . above all , the development of technology brings about the indivisualism . in other word , because each person ha amusment thing such a the tv , computer , p2p in each home , people do n't need people whom we enjoy time with becasue people can enjoy enough their time using this eqpuipment . for example , when i wa in secondary school , i would rather spend the time on playing game by computer than playing game with my friend in playground or house . thus , such a indivisualism allows people concentrate on just oneself , thereby making people spend more time in their house and not giving enough time to helping their community . moreover , the competitive education make young people not helping their community . in particular , today 's educaion enable baby go to the private academy to become more smart child . in this process , young child believe that more important thing in success life is concentrating on myself not others . for instance , parent prefer to their child to concentrate on only study than help other people . therfore , because such a competitive education not allow child spend their time on thing except study , young people do n't have any chance to help other people . in conclusion , i agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their local neighbor any more for the reason that i mentioned above . not only high level indivisualism but also competitive education make young people not be able to spend their time on helping their community .
