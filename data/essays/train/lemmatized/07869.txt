i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their community . maybe some young people had done enough , but in average level , it 's true that most of young people use their time in play and enjoy their living time . i think there are some bad condition for the young people in-correct attitude and concept . they think it 's not concern with them . maybe they have much more important thing need to do and share their time , so they consider they are very bussy , so they ar n't willing to pay more time to helping their community . i thinkthe best solution that need family , school and society share the duty to change young people 's concept and attitude . so parent , teacher and government officer need work hard and corporate from now on . include study and education , let young people why they need pay more attention and time to helping their community and let they know they have duty to keep this work continuly , when one day they marry and there are chilkdren , they need transfer this concept to their child all of their life . so make sure this world will keeping opportunity and enough power to helping t and keep their community . of course , the government officer can use tv , newspaper and so on to open enough message about who to helping community . so most of young people are willing to handle and share enough duty to do it . at one word , all of people include younger and elder people , there are the same duty to keep and helping their their community , so all of human there are more high quality community lever and society can grow up and implement every century and all over the world continuly and forever . bless the human can get best community for everyone
