i agree with the statement with `` young people enjoy there life more than older people do '' . when life is like a game and we ever dont know that will happen any time with our game . so i think it wa best place to enjoy the life at some good young stage . enjoying the life can be of many form . but it should be make some attention in the career growth too . for example a young kid can enjoy his profession which intern make sucess for this career . enjoying the life with some carrer oriented allways a good option . i enjoy my current profession software engineer very much and i like to keep every thing honest without any misleads . this is the way i feel myself happy . there are many example like the people enjoy there work and becoming very great people . small example i can give is google websearch creator , they enjoyed there profession very much and started developing a very great product this intern leaded to the employment to many people aroung the world . young people enjoy there life and also should set some example what is the proper meaning of the `` enjoying the life '' . this is not only releated to the area of science this can be releated to the area of music , art , soical etc . youngsters are backbone of any country development and growth . but the enjoying the life should not turn in bad habbits example like drugs , sex etc . seting example to the others is allways are great feeling for any young kid . there are many greater story happening in the recent time about many young kid how do they enjoy the life and set example . finally i feel we ha to enjoy the life with fun and passion and face the problem straight and set example to the others
