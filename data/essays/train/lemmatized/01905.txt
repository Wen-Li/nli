i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . the inmature attitude and the strong ability to get involved in activity make the young people beable to enjoy life more . the young people are often willing to do some new thing to make the life more interesting , while the older people are oftne afraid to try thing that are unfamiliar to them . for example , young people like to wear fashionable cloth and drive fancy car which are really cool for them . on the other side , older people such a my parent who are much more conservative . they often consider those cool thing inmature and inappropriate . they always tell me not to buy those weird cloth away and spend more time on my school work . wearing those cloth make me feel special and i can compare them with my friend . however , there are few older people wearing cloth like teenager . also , young people are able to do some excited activity that older people are afraid or not able to participate because their body condition are not a well a young people . for example , i consider skiing the most excited and enjoyable sport in my life . it is fast and it doe not hurt much when i fall into the snow . however , everytime when i invite my dad to join my friend and i to have a skiing trip , he refuse because he doe not know how to ski at all . although i try to convince him that it is easy to learn , he is still afraid to try . in conclusion , young people are willing to try new thing and participate in some excited activity which older people are not able to do because they are old and have different attitude from young people .
