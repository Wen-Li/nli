i do agree with the statement that , `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' the possibility of author statement being right in some situation and untrue in others render the statemant deabatable . i would like to highlight severals example in support of my position and on my way . firstly , on the looking at the the statement in twenty yers ther - e will be fewer car in use than there are now presently might look quite convincing but on a closer scrutine the statement is unacceptable and downright erronous . for example , when we consider traffic problem and other problem which lead to blockling of road the statement is acceptable a it stand . secondly , by considering on the number of people and the area to park the vechicles whic , h creates lot many problem the statement is acceptable . but when we consider the commucating point of u view , car are required for almost every individual and which make he or she to communicate easily . on this condition the statement is unacceptable . thirdly , by considering this the manufacturing point of view , in which more and more number of car are manufactured and since there is demand in car they manufacture them and it never end but with little update in model of the car . since in the demand point of view also u ca n't agree with the statement that car decrese day by day . finally , when considering environment point of view , the government may put rule that only whose financial position is good enough only ha to buy car if so then the statement can be accepted . but i think it do n't really work . in my point of view , i oppose the statement that car decrease day by day and i also stateted many example to support my idea and my own opinion and also in more twenty year it double . neverthless , on a detailed analysis reveals that the statement is unacceptable and even indefensible also . in sum , the issue in quesion is entirely debitable and therfore a balanced view must be arrived at by thorough analysis .
