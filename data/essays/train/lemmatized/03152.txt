i believe that we should attempt new trial and take some risk for more successful life . because trial and error let u realize our limitaions , and so , we can correct our error and try to overcome our defect . in addition , though there are some danger in attempting new work , it creats unexpected result , give great inspiration and make u stronger and better . i think that most people have limitation physically or mentally or financially . if we just satisfy with our current situation , we never improve our life and never experience better and hidden happiness . for example , beethoven , a renowned musican and a great human , had an ear disease . he did n't even hear audience 's loud applause after the premieur of his last symphony . however , despite his severe sickness , beethoven tried to overcome his defect and created many new and innovative classical music . due to his effort , today many people hear many exceptional touching sound . if he satisfied his situation and did not make effort to overcome himself , not only he could be rememberd a a great artist but we also never meet many great music . moreover , i think that crisis and danger sometimes produce unexpected result and make u stronger and competent person . for instance , many scientist have researched some risky and doubtful fact and they have found many wonderful solution . thses discovery have developed science and our life . in addition , in my experience , when i faced difficulty in my job , i did not avoid them and tried to resolve those problem . as a result , i could find various solution and develop myself into a competent staff . in conclusion , i do believe that trial and risk make people stronger and better . we all have a brain and a heart . i think that we need to use and devleope them through effort to overcome our current obstacle .
