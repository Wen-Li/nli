most advertise make product seem much better than they really are now there more and more advertisement , we can see them erervy where . every advertisement is interduce the new product of their company . most of the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i saw a advetisement talked about a mp3 player , the advertisement said that the mp3 player can continue play mp3 for 20 hour , but most people bought it and found it can only play for 16 hour or le , so they asked the company to give a explain on it . the company 's explain is that when it playing song , it have to turn to the lowest voice and can not change song , so it can play for 20 hour . but it is impossible for user to do like that , when turn to the lowest voice , it almost can not hear it . and change song is very common for mp3 player . i had saw a lot so advertisement like this . so the product not that good like the advertisement told u . the advertisement ' purpose is let u to buy the product , so the advertisement tell u all the good thing about the product , but will not tell u what the produt is not good at . so afer we see the advertisement and buy the product , the feeling is the product is not a good a the advertisement say . so i agree with the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . most of the product can not do the advertisement said . when we buy some product we should not just only watch the advertisement , we should ask someone who buy the product is it ture like the advertisement say . do this will help alot when we buying product .
