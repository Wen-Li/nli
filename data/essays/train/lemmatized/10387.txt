first of all i have to admit that it is very difficult for me to say if i agree or disagree with this statement . in my opinion it is a very important thing that young people give enough time to helping their community . but young people do not and neither do i . i do not have any time to help my community because i spend most of my time at university and i have to work verz hard in my free time , too . i can understand why young people do not want to help their community . the first reason is that young people do not get money for this work . perhaps if they got money they would help their community . another reason is that young people only want to enjoy their life . they do not think a lot about community . another reason could be that young people want to discover the world . they do not want to stay with their community . perhaps it is possible to lure young people to help their community . if there were good condition they would help . and if some young people began this work other people would follow . so if many young people were involved in this help they would have fun together . furthermore it is necessary to make a lot of advertisment for helping the community . but from my point of view you have to see the fact . as i mentioned at the beginning of my essay young people are not interested in helping their community and i think it would be a really difficult briefing to change their behaviour or opinion . and i think there are other people who have to help the community , for instance the major . so , in summay i have to say that i am a little bit sad about it that i can not help my community very much . but i can understand people who do not have any time helping their community or do not want to . from my point of view young people have to solve other problem than helping their community . but people who do not have a lot work to do might help .
