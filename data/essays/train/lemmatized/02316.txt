i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because i believe that the people who have strong wish to be successful , are more likely to be successful . my father is a business man who work for the japanese company . when i wa young , my father 's job wa to trade oil , and the company asked him to go to ny with family to work there . when i arrived ny with my mother and father , i wa surprised because the other business man who worked there were at least 10 year older than my father . i asked my mother why , and she told me that my father is one of a rare case . he always suggests new thing and try new thing that the company ha never done , so he is working with older people who is working much longer than my father . when i heard of it , i thought it is good to challenge new thing rather than only doing what i already know . there is another strong example which i have seen in television about a week ago . i wa watching the japanese tv programme which is about successful people in japan . on that day , they were showing about one singer who is very popular in japan now . in the programme , he said that he wa actually a business man when he wa twenty year old , and suddenly he quit his job to be a singer . he loses his job and had a very hard time until the famous music producer found him , but he said it wa a priceless time which wa crucial to his life , because he still remembers those time and he even wrote a song about that time . due to those reason , i strongly belive that people who try new thing and take risk will be successful . even though they have difficult time before being succeeded , you will learn thing from that time for sure , and your success will be even more valuable .
