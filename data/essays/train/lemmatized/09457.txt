i agree with this opinion . when i wa traveled thiland by myself . there wa too many problem happend . a im a girl . i wa threatend my security . it wa really stressful . and i ca n't conversation with thai people . i did n't know how to deal with many problem like housing , eating . . so travel in a group led by a tour guide ha many beneficial . first of all , you will protect from a guide and group . security is very important when you are traveling new place . secon reason is that tour guide know well about travel and which place is recomendable . so you do n't need to spend your time for considering about which place is more good to travel . third reason is that you do n't need to worry about housing and eating . generally a tour guide is speak a very good local language and a tour guide led group of a people . so fee for room is more cheap . and most tour company related to bunch of hotel change . if you travel a a group member you do n't need to worry about food. a tour guide help you what you eat on the travel . all you need to do is just enjoy your vacation
