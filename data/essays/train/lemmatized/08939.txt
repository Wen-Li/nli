whether it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide or just by your own , ha both advantage and disadvantage depending on many factor or characteristic of the trip . three importants factor are : the amount of money the person ha , for how much time he will be travelling , and the personal oppinion about flexibility . firstly , hireing a tour guide can be very expensive and , in some case , much more expensiver that travelling alone . for example , it is free to go through paris walking on your own , and it can be very expensive to pay for a group tour . nonetheless , you will probably need to buy a guide if you do not want to miss the important place . it is cheaper to walk on your own only if the guide is not a expensive a the tour . secondly , a guided tour work better for someone who ha not got too much time to visit a place . in this case , he will have someone to take him to the unmissable place and to give him some explanation . on the other hand , if someone ha , for example , three month to visit two city , he will probably have time to get around on his own , ask for some advise to different local people and see or visit much more different place than the number of place he would visit on a guided group tour . the third factor ha to do with preference . people have different oppinion about how much flexibility they like to have when they are travelling , and there is not only one correct or a best oppinion . some people like to have a schedule that detail every place they will visit , and what they will do every day . however , other people like to feel free to do what they feel like doing on each day , depending , for example , on their mood . in spite of the fact that a person can make a detailed schedule when travelling alone , on guided tour , people are usually le free to do what they feel like doing on that day . in conclusion , there is not one best way to travel . everyone can have their own best way depending on their personal characteristic and on the trip they are planning to take . therefore , each person ha to decide whether to travel in a group with a tour guide or by their own .
