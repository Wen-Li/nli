i think it is necessary to define the term car concerning this question , it can either be the car a we know it today , a vehicle using a large amount of a non renewable ressource , or it can be the same thing , just different , different in shape and size , but mostly in the type of energy it will use . i disagree with the statement because i am of the opinion , that a soon a petrol get too expensive for the average driver of a conventional car , the possibility of alternative car desings and engine , will soon be much more attractive and new customer for new idea will be found by then . i think people will call those vehicle car a well and there will be a large amount of those new vehicle . probably we will have more car than ever before , because once the big car company think they can make money with car running on alternative fuel or engine , they will try a hard a they can to be a competetive and influencial a they are now . this influnce can lead to large substities and tax advantage in the beginning of the rise of those new car , that will make the process very fast if it ha startet . some might say that there will be an increase in the use of public transport system , that is true , but only in big city where car are not a important a they are outside urban area . human being are creature with habit , one habit is driving car , having the convenience of independence . i do n't think that it is possible to take car away totaly , not even partly , there can only be more , because that is the way almost all our society work , based on growth and developement , there wo n't be any step backward , there will be change in the way we drive , but human will drive because we are used to it .
