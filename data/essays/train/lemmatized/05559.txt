christopher columbus wa the first european to discover the continent america . he wa an explorer . i thinkt it is quite evident to everybody that in order to reach his aim he had to take a lot of risk and finally , although america is not india , he succeeded . but is it always necessary to take risk in order to be a successful person . with regard to this question the first thing to come into my mind is that there are actually a lot of people who are highly successful without ever taking much risk in their life . i am talking about people who have a pleasant childhood , who have nice parent that are aware of their responsibilty of being parent . parents who care about the education of their child . mostly those child have fewer problem at school which mean they have better mark and therefore are allowed to study on well-reputated university and finally become for example high-paid businessmen . they never take much risk and still become successful . moreover i am not sure if it would not be better to focus on your strength . michael porter for instance affirmed , that company should rather focus on their competency instead of trying to enhance their weakness . in my view that is applicable for human-beings . you probably could be much more successful if you try to enhance your already existing skill than to start to learn new skill , and of course that is le risky . but on the other hand there is no denying the fact that there are numerous example , like kolumbus , which proof that a certain amount of risk is a premise for success . that for example can easily on the stock market . the stock that yield the highest profit are also those which can cost you a lot of money - they are highly risky . and of course the exmaple of the businessmen is only some kind of a stereotype . often one ha to make difficult decision in order to reach one | 's aim in the working life . decisions always equal potential risk . suppose you get a challenging high-paid job offer in asia . then you could jump on it taking the risk of going into a new country and being exposed to strange and maybe unkind people or you could deny it and stay in your homecountry earning an average amount of money leading a normal life . taking all the relevant aspect into consideration i reach the conclusion that it is always a trade-off . you can either be successful taking no risk an relying on your old skill or you can be successful taking a lot of risk by going a new and different way . therefore i can not totally agree with this statement .
