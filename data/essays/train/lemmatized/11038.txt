if i can choose the answer whether i agree or disagree with that the best way is in a groop led by tour guide . i definetly choose the answer that i disaggree with the statment . i would not like travel by a tour guide . folowing i will take specific reason why i dislike trabeling by tour guide . first , there is great restriction of time if he or she travel in groupe by a tour guide . in my case , now i work very hard in daytime and i might be ordered accidently by the bos to work horiday . so a is often to the case with traveling is in a grop by a tour guide , when to travel and where to trabel is already detamined and is not available for me . therefore , i prefer to trabel alone or with few friend by coordinating easy to suit my own work time . second reason i dislike traveling by a tour guide is that guiding can decrease opportunity to communicate people in the destination by using foregin language . usually , a tour guide can some foregin language and in travel , a guide translate foreing language of destination and we do not have to use foreign language . that is nonsense for me because i want to study foreign langage especially in my travel . i beleive that traveling alone , without tour guide is good for improve my speaking foregin langrages . last , if i travel abroad alone without a tour guide , i can discover something in my travel with my oun effort . that is presure for me ! all above of that , i prefer traveling alone or with few friend to traveling in a group by a tour guide . of course , there are some advantage of traveling in a group . for example , the price of traveling tends to be lower and more economical if we choose traveling in a group . but , a i take all above of that. , in my opinion , advatntages of traveling alone withotut guide is much greater than these of traveling in a group led by a tour guide .
