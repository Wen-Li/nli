different people have different view a to how they spend their life and what they weant to persue . as time move on , these goal and behaviour also change with the mindset and life of people . it is necessary for people to be able to live their age . for example a high school student 's priority would be do excell in his study and do well in school whereas a businessman 's would be to ensure he earns a much money he can . the main difference between the people above in the example is that where one is a sixteen year old kid , the other is a thirty-five year old who probably ha a family to support . that doe not mean that they live only for those thing . they live life the way they are supposed to , accordingly to their responsability . young people comparatively do n't have much to worry about and can enjoy themselves at a discotheque or play sport or what they are able to do . older people can indulge in more ` mature ' way of having fun and enjoying life like watching an ` art ' movie or going for a cruise . i personally do not agree with the statement a i feel that it doe not take into consideration people 's lifestyle . young people can also watch and enjoy art movie if their lifestyle is like that . richard branson the entrepreneur is a major risk-taker and life life to the fullest . people have their own way and method of keeping themsleves satisfied and enjoy life a the feel is right to them . there have been plenty of case where old people have gone water-skiing , i think that they are really enjoying their life ! true there are limitation when it come to the age-factor , if the biological clock is ticking then one must face it and roll with it . one can not expect an eighty year old to go rock climbing . that same elderly person may enjoy him/her self in the compnay of friend or family . young people dont enjoy life more than older people , they enjoy it differently .
