i do not agree with this statement . i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . this is because if a person ha a broad knowledge of many academic subject and if he doe not specialize in any of them then he would be a best example of `` jack of all trade but specialist of none . '' this would definetly not prove useful for him and for the society a a whole . he will not be in a position to contribute anything , because he doe not know any subject in-dept . if he just ha a broad view of many subject , then in the later stage of his life , that is after his graduation , he would remain in a confused state of mind , and he will not be in a position to settle on one particular field . i am saying this confidentally because i faced a similar situation in my own life . when i wa in my college studying b-tech ( biotechnology ) , i used to give equal importance to all my subject . so after my graduation i wa in dilemma , and i wa finally confused with my profession . i wa not able to settle down on one particular subject . so i would suggest that it would be better that we choose one particular subject in which we are highly interested , and then put our soul and mind into it , to learn the subject thoroughly and perfectly . in this way we will have a greater in-sight into the subject and we will be in a position to contribute something from our side for the betterment of the subject .
