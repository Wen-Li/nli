do you agree this statement that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' ? as far a i am concerned , i think that the individual travel is another better choice than travelling in a group with a tour guide . in addition , i will provide the reason in the following to support my opinion . first of all , i argue that if someone travel alone , he / she could have more surprising and interesting experience that can not happen in group travelling and posse the more unforgettable memory during the trip . for example , my friend , she traveled in the us few year ago . she told me that she went to a small town then lost her all money . however , a kind person borrow her money and let my friend to live . therefore , she also had a gread time . secondly , i consider that we can learn how to be independent and settle the trouble that encounter accidently when person travel without a tour guide . to summerize , i believe that individual travelling is not only a good oppotunity to experience the different and interesting way of travel , but also could train u to become an independent person and learn more . in the ending , i will conclude my argument by emphasizing on individual travel is good way to have experiencesand to learn something . trying to travel alone .
