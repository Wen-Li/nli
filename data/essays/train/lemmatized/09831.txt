nowadays , you can find many people who have an amazing amount of knowledge . but some people seem to be an expert on every subject . it appears to be that not many people really know something about a certain subject , but without real expert , our industrial word would not work . experts are obviously needed to receive true and exact information about a theme . but if you want to know , for instance , something about a complex problem in the process of a dna synthesis , you need someone who learned about that all his studying time ! to avoid misunderstanding of very popular theme , like biotechnique , you need to have clear and verifyed information . if everybody know a little bit , this puzzle will not end up in a clear picture , but in chaos of incomplete or even wrong information . but , of course , expert are needed in the industry to create an effective team . for example , to build a house , you need a mathematics expert , a resource expert and so on . they all match together to a perfect team , which now is able to create new idea , which work . maybe the head of the team could be someone with a broader knowledge , but , however , his function in the team is to be an expert of organisation . i am aware of the problem , that if someone is an expert of a certain subject , but doe not know anything of the rest of the world , it can come to problem , even dangerous one . if a doctor doe not know anything about politics and the democratic system we live in , he/she could make dramatically wrong decision . he/she would not understand the value and the social environemet we live in . to prevent that , a state need very good school , which every citzin ha to go to , while he is a child and a young man/woman . this school should teach him/her all the neccessary basic knowledge . concluding , i would say , that our world urgently need expert , who know about their subject very well , in order to accomplish all task our society come up with . good grammar school must garranty that every citzin understands the basic structure of our society .
