frankly speaking this is a difficult question to answer . i think that a lot of people would like to answer to this question because this involves a lot of economical and social interest . however , i 'll try to express my idea . when i wa born ( 1970 ) there were fewer car than today and even if the fuel is more and more expensive , the insurance is very expensive and car are not cheap , the number of car is increasing every year . this is due to a moderate growth of car in the more industrialized country but also to a rapid and uninterrupted economical growth of le developed country . the continuous growth all over the world is requiring more and more mobility . it 's understood that mobility doe n't mean car only . you may have train , plane , ship and so on . but car still remain the most diffused vehicle that people use to move from one place to another place . in my opinion it 's also difficult to think about a reduction of the number of car all over the world . we can think that in the near future the number of car may decline in big city due to the traffic which is already chaotic but this will be compensated by an impressive growth in other country ( e.g. china , india and other growing country ) . that 's why it 's very difficult to agree with the initial statement . it 's also true to say that we all hope that the number of car will not bring additional smog . what i hope is that new technology will allow a more substainable growth . some of these new technology already exist but are simply more expensive than gasoline . but i hope that electricity , hydrogen and hybrid vehicle will replace the traditional car and will give u back blue sky , even in the big city . cristian spallanzani
