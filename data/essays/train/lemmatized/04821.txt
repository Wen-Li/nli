when it come to public transport and car , people tend to take their car instead of public transport . on the one hand , it is more easy to take public transport when you are in the city . on the other hand , people prefer their car because they are not disturbedby noisy people . as far a i am concerned , i think that the use of car will dicrease in twenty year . first reason i believe this , it is because nowadays people tend to take public transport because they arrive at home or at their work place very quickly . however it is true , that it is not always enjoyable to take public transport because of others people and the noise but we can tolerate each other to manage to live in peace . the second reason i believe this , it is because it is more secure . people can read a book in the train or can also listen music with their mp3 player . however it is true we can listen music behind the wheel . but when people who drive are tired , they can rest a little bit in the train or bus and they do not have to be concentrated on the road to go home. , they will not have car accident which are more and more important nowadays . finally , last but not least , peolpe gain a lot of time , it is fantastic . for example they do not have to search a car park during hour , because we know that it is very difficult to find car place in big city , such a paris . and also they can achieve homework or reading a paper for an assignement when they take public transport . in conclusion , i believe that it will be more convienient and iwe do not use car anymore not to use car in twenty year .
