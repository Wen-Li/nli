i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for example , my family had a apple tree in our backyard . when we get the apple from the tree the apple had worse looking than from a store . another example is i have heard that a company for selling food , which are manto and dimsom , made the food just good taste and good-looking , but not good for health . first , when i wa in my elementary school in korea , my family had a apple tree in our backyard of my apartment . we never gave it any chemical pesticide or never do advertisement . after i graduated from the elementary school , my family and i could get nine apple from the tree . three of them were already eaten by insect , so we could n't eat the tree of them ; however , others were fine , but it looked really worse than the apple in a fruit store . even if the taste of my apple wa better than of the store 's apple , i felt my apple 's taste is worse because the appearance of my apple made the apple had bad taste . second , i have seen that a company for selling food , manto , dimsom , or etc. , made the food by the wasted trash from restourants in the news . when they made it had a good-looking , they did advertisement , also they put some chemical material to make it ha good teste . so , the food from the company had really good taste and good looking , but extremly bad for one 's health . there are still some company like that in korea . even though the food is not already eatable , the advertisments make it eatable . for that reason , i agree that advertisement make product seem better . because of my expriences , the apple tree and news about ` trash food , ' i agree that the most advericements make product seem much better thatn they really are . but , i also think the advertisement is necessary because i make the food taste better by giving good appearace .
