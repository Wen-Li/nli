i 'm agree with this statement , first of all , i think this is a result of the globalization of the economy , that push some industry to compete in a market place and a a result we see advertisement that show some product better than they really are . i 'm not again the globalization but i believe that , a it is positive in some way but also ha a negative side . the advertisement we see on this day , show product like food , clothes and electronic device in a better way they really are . its very comon on the food industry where constantly we see in tv comecials , and poster on the steet , that some restaurant show they product bigger than they really are , also we can see a pair of tennis shoe that can give you the ability of jump higher that any pair of shoe in the market , and when you finally wear the shoe you see you just make the same performance . there are professional staff dedicated to emphatize the caracteristic of a product line , and one of the common rule is to show the product in a very atractive scenario , like the car in a road besides the sea , or the same car in the mountain with a spectacular view and a famous model behind the wheel . i think that globalization ha some responsability on this , but not all the responsability , because even before people start to talk about globalization this used to happened in a lower scale . there are other factor that will have to be consider , like the medium , the industry and the culture of the country . i will not defintly blame a single factor , i believe that there are a lot of factor why advertisement make product seem much better that they really are .
