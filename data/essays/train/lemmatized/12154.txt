i agree to the statment that young people are not giving enough time to help their community and i have my reason for such belief . in the following paragraph , i shall bring forth my rationality for taking the particular stance . first we need to analyze what ha changed over the time . is the community expecting more out of young people or is young people are facing crunch of time to devote to their community . i feel that the expectation of community ha not increased over the period of time but it is due to the change in mindset of young people . due to advent of new source of entertainment , people have le time to spend for other activity . earlier , the general idea of an entertainment wa to meet people , go out play with child in park etc . this way people interact with each other and can understand problem if any faced by community member . now entertainment is taken over by play station and other electronic item which keep people occupied during their leisure time . the defination of entertainment ha changed over the period . it is more of an indoor event than of an outdoor event , which ha made life more dull and led to le interaction with other people . these day , life is more fast paced and which ha changed the attitude of young generation . they want to achieve a much a possible in short span of time using the shortest route . due to this rush , people are becomming more materialisitic and they started le giving le importance to old value . this is another grave reason which ha significantly curtailed the participation of young people in community . nuclear family is another thing which have contributed to change in the people 's attitude . earlier people use to stay together a a joint family . this way grand parent were able to inculcate the good moral value in young one and they were able to use them a a pillar in their life . now family are growing smaller and parent have le time to spend with their child . due to which they are not able to impart those moral value into their child . in the end , i would like to summarize that people 's mind set ha changed over the period and if the trend continues then we will see le and le participation of young people in community exercise .
