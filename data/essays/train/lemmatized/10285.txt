the topic deal with the improtance of understanding idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact , the purpose of studing is to gain knowledge about the topic he is studying , i agree with the above topic and i am in faver of it . in order to do some work or implement it in or daily life you must know about the main contantys of the study and core concept , you may think of `` computer science '' in order to handle a computer you must the component of it and the function of each part . if youn take the help of teacher it may help you a lot in any concept or in any object that you want to learn about . when u know deep about it only you can operate it or repair it if any damage take place , whit out knowing it you canot touch a single part in it so must know the `` hard ware '' concept of the `` computer '' or if you want to use a `` soft ware '' like `` windows '' you must know or have a knowledge about `` soft ware '' also . similarly if you want to design a car you must know what are the main part of it and they function , you must know about the machine mat how they work and also how they are connected internally , and also you must know about the micro processor that in dult in car which can not be learned practically . the main concept of each and every object is known by learning about it concept and the main idea of it , if you have idea on the perticular topic then you must gain practical knowledge of that perticular object on which you are going to work . you can ride a bike only when you know the operation of each object of the moter bike , orther wise it may lead to accedents also , so i conclude that it is more important for a student to under stand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact .
