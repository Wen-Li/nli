in my opinion , i do not believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do . first of all , younger people have to work hard to get to the stage , so they can have the experience of an older man or older woman . second , a a young person , you are restricted to do many thing an adult can do , and finally , a an older man/woman life is open to you , you are free to do what you want . first of all , teenagers have to work their way up to be successful in their life , this mean carrying many responsibility . i will use myself for an example ; i am 16 and a half and im a senior at woburn high school , recentley i have been hit with many responsibilites such a college . i applied to 6 college , and have worked many day completing the application . i could have decided to not do all this work , but i want to advance . when i grow old i want the chance to have a good future and enjoy it . young people do not enjoy life more than older people do . second , a a young person , you are restricted to do many thing an adult can do . for example , buying a car . as a minor , a person under 18 can not purchase an automotive vehicle without parental consent . i am a big fan of car , however , i ca n't purchase one until i turn 18 . older people do not have to deal with this . older people can go and buy whatever they want , whenever they want , but that cant be neccessarily a good thing . finally , a a man or a woman get old , they find out that life is open to them . they have finished paying the morgage for their house , and they have a good amount of money in their bank . what is there for them to do ? they can do anything . they could go to florida and live the rest of their life on a beach , or they can even stay at their house , and relax for the rest of their life . younger people can not do that . in conclusion , younger people dont always have it harder than older people . older people already went through the stage of their life where they worked hard to reach their goal . for younger people that stage ha just opened up .
