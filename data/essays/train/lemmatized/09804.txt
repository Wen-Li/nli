yes . i agree that in the near future the number of car that are in use will be lesser than that of today 's car count . the first reason for my agreement with the statement is that the world 's economy is growing at a faster rate and technological innovation are immanent within the system . this might result in an efficient , cost-effective , superfast railway network which connencts an urban area like a labyrinth . the main emphasis is given to urban are in the previous statement because they are the one that have more number of car than the rural area usually do . the state-of-art technology might drive the communers to use the railway a an alternative to using car . this might lead to le number of car in next twenty year . there is a general concern over environmental pollution especially on air pollution . the main contributor to this air pollution is the smoke produced from the exhaust of the car engine . the awareness toward this pollution might reach all the citizen of the urban area and make them realize the importance to reduce the pollution . as a result they might seek alterantive mean of transport apart from car . consequently this awareness might urge the citizen not to use car in the near future . one of the major concern in the modern society is the cost of the petroleum or gas . it is so high that people are hesitating to use car even now . as the natural resource of the earth are limited and the use of oil consumption ha been very high despite it cost , the situation in twenty year could be marked by lack of enough oil for transporation . obvioulsy this would inhibit people from using the car if there are no other alternative fuel for car . in twenty year an exotic , efficient and impressive machine might be invented . as humanbeings , who always want to try out something new , would feel prestigious if they were possessed with that exotic , impressive machine . again this might lead to decrease in number of car in twenty year .
