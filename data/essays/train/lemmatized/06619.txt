i am a young person and i am working for free in the catholic community of my hometown . so i have a good idea of what young people do to help in their community . because of this , i am convinced that the statement is wrong . i know many young peolpe which are helping in the catholic community . there are many holiday camp for child which are organized by young people in our community . there is also a monthly meeting of this people . new game or special festival are organized by this group of young peolpe . many peolpe do not recognize this work . it is not so obviously like beeing a trainer of a child soccer team . but not all young people are working in a community like me . i believe this is because working in community is first of all not very honorable . many people do not even care about the community work . communtiy work will be noticed the first time by them , if nobody doe it anymore . second , community work is not very attractive to young people . the most people , working for free in the community , are very old . but it is not much fun for any teenager to work with senior . if their friend spend time helping the community , most of the young people will have a great plessure to help their community - togehter with their friend . and it is also a problem that most of community work is not for the youth . young peolpe do not see the neccessarity to help their community , because the community work doe not take effect in their allday life . overall , i am convinced that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their community . furthermore , i believe that they do more at this time then in the past .
