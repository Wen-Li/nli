i agree , all student have to understand idea and concetps , because it is one way to learn about a topic , and it is easier for them to focus and memorize . they will know the concept in their world , and they are going to be able to put in practice . i think it is going to be difficult to forget , becuase if the concept is easier to memorize , they will practice evey day . and it is going to realize evey day . for example . when you want to learn something , the fir step is to take a book or a dictionary , and you find out a world , at he beging , it is to be difficult but they want to undertand the meaning . another way , it is when start going to the school , the teacher write a concept on the board , and they explain to the student , in their word , besides they use a picture or draw . all teacher are trying to explain the meaning and the goal for the teacher is going to be , when they know everybody in the class understood . at the end of the semester , they are able to past the exam , and they are goint to get good grade . at the end i think to know and understan the idea it is going to be heplfull , in my experiecia , it help in my carreear , at the begining of the university you have to memorize a lot concepst , the only way you can do that
