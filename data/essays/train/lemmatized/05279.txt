i am agree wih the statemant . i have three reason why i 'm support the statement . first , it is natural making product seem much better than they really are . advertisement is economy . so , making product seem much better is nurtural . please imagine . for example , food . if the advertisement in food do n't look like delicious , most people will not buy because it seems taste bad . then , economy doe n't work . nobady buy it , then , the product disappear . the reasn why most people buy the product is influenced in advertisement . at least , japan , most people are influenced by advertisement . in fact , i 'm one of them . second , advertisement is competition between many company . how they can make the people to buy it or how make their product look like good . it is true that the product which i bought wa bad . however , it show that how the advertisement have big influence . finally , you know that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . you shoud remember thet . i think making prducts seem much better is bad thing . but , above all , it is economy . so , we ca n't do anything . all we have to do is remember that most advertisement make product much better than they really are .
