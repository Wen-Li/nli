undertanding idea in my view , it is important for student to undertand idea and concept than it for them to learn fact . also i think it is much easyier than learning fact and more acceptable . for example , if he ha a biology class and the teacher is trying to explaine the lesson , the student will understanding hardly if the tf the teacher is explaining a a fact , but if the teacher explained it a an idea or a concept it will be easy like a peice of cake . second , you have nothing to do with fact because in this century no one want to lesson fact most of them prefare to know the something a an idea . i think also they will memorise it and remember it quickly more than fact . another example , if you want to go to a campus and some of your friend aked you a question about a lesson , attitude , anything else you will not be able to answer him a good answer unless if you know it a an idea or a concept . i think also that the doctor studyed that understanding idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact and the doctor approved that by making experience on the poaple so he made groupe who undertand fact and another on finally , i would like to advice all of poeple to undertand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because it is easyier and more comfortable to all of u .
