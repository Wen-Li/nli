the number of car appering on traffic is groving rapidly everyday . some people argue that in a near future there will be way too much car than the road and city can support . however this is not the only idea on the issue . some people ha firm belief that in two decade , the number of car will reduce . i agree with this statement . first , the way of living for the most people is changing substatially . it is now possible for much more people to work at home with the improvement in technology and the internet . the need for going to office everyday between certain hour is fading away . also , the energy supply that are needed to run conventional automobile are getting lesser everyday , unless a new energy source will be found , which will also have to be very cheap , driving a car will become much more expensive than today . the rise in the petrol price is daily news nowadays . another point to mention is the negative effect of car to the environment . the public is getting more concerned everyday to the environment issue , and their sensitivity reflect to their lifestyle . most people start preferring alternative transportation such a subway , train , or even bycycles . furthermore , it will not be fortune telling to predict that the government will take action in order to discourage people from using car . the negative effect of growing number of car on traffic ha serious impact on economy . even today , the structure of the city are not capable of supporting so many car and some measure to reduce the number of car , are in public opinion . in conclusion , there are much more supporting reason to predict that the demand for car will reduce . the ground for such an arguement can be based on economic , social and technological need and requirement . there is no reason for not to believe that the number of the car will be fewer than they are today .
