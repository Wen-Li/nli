i would have to say that the best way to travel is being your own tour guide . i personally like to explore place by myself , i am curious and i am not afraid to take risk . to me sound boring just to think about the idea of traveling with a group of people and depend on somebody else 's schedule and not on my own . when people travel with a tour guide they usually depend on the guide 's schedule during the whole trip , and that could be one of the inconvenience . for example , in a group of people of different age , the older one would agree with some situation while the younger probably would not . if they have to follow a guide they have no choice to change the schedule and avoid doing thing or going to place where they are not comfortable . personally , when i travel somewhere , i like to explore the place by myself , get a map , take a train and find place without having to follow somebody that already know where to go and what to do . if i end up getting lost in an unknown place it is not a problem for me , on the other hand , it is fun ! i like to explore culture by knowing how their people behave . for example , during my last trip to rome i discovered the most friendly people i have ever had contact with before . i wa lost for 3 hour , and even though i had a map and i knew how to find my way , i started asking for direction to people on the road , and i really loved the fact that they would stop no matter for how long and talk to me , try to help me in the most friendly way , and that is an experience i really enjoyed . to me , that is the only way someone can really enjoy visiting a new place : taking risk and exploring . it is also more expensive to travel having a touristic guide . sometimes we save money for a long time to get a chance to travel somewhere and it is not worth it to spend a considerable amount of that money paying somebody who is going to show u the place and probably talk about relevant historical passage of that part of the world if we are able to get a book and read about the same topic and take a train or any transportation medium to get wherever we want by ourselves . the best way to travel is to go without planning too much . in my opinion it is more exciting the unexpected : being in a new place , getting to talk to local people , following my own schedule without having to think about what time is it , discover place by myself and have a really fun story to remember forever .
