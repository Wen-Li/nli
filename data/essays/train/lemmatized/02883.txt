the provided topic state that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . i disagree with the statement a it is my opinion that older people enjoy life more than young people . nowadays , we live in a world that is economically driven and requires good planning and wise decision making . due to their wide experience in life , older people are able to plan wisely in order to enjoy their life . for example , older people will plan their outing , vacation , activity , and event more effectively than young people . for a vaction , they plan where they wanted to go and what they wanted to see and how much the cost would be . this way they will enjoy all aspect of their vacation and not miss important event or sighting . whilst , if they went on a vaction , younger people would not plan a well and eventually miss out a lot of important activity and sighting . consequently , with their good planning , older people would only spend mony on what they wanted to see and enjoy . whilst younger people would run out of money and usually regret some of the thing they did not see in their vacation . in addition , older people would have more money to enjoy life with than younger people . older people are more established in their career and therfore more financially sound and actually save have saved their money to enjoy their life at this stage . whilst younger people may not have a much money to enjoy life with a some of them may be in school or not employed . some of them may have not even thought of a career at this point in their life . on the other hand , there are always exception a there are younger people who do plan well , are established in their career , and are financially well off . but generally speaking , due to their life experience , older people plan well , established in their field , and are financially more sound than younger people .
