the issue at this hand is you should better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i belive this because all the subject you have knoledge is not uued in future why because if you inter in to any interview taht they ask spasalization . this reason is used to define the above statement . this is importent because if you have broad knoledge of many academic subject than to specialized on one specific subject . i donot believe this because is you have many academic subject in your academic year . these all subject you reed not used in real life first reason is if you attend any organigation interview thy spcify the subject . because you need not have a broed knoledge of academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . another reason is that all the subject you have broad knoldge is some academic subject used in future like if join any college that if you are a computer student the collge is give you two or three subject give for lecture at that time broad knowledge of many subject used for lecturere . finally l belive that broad knoledge on many subject used in future thn that the specialized in one subject . they are many reason to that if i have broad knowledge in many academic subject than specialized subjet . speacialized subject are used for yor job . if you have any specialization searching for any job organization mention the specialized the subject for perticular job . i belive two thinga that the broad knowledge of many academic subject and specialize in one specific subject is used in carrir .
