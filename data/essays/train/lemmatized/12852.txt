i do not agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all , car industry is now developing very fast in the developing country such a china and india . these country have large number of population . large population mean big potential of car comsuming . people living in these country are becoming richer and richer . therefore , more and more people in these country are able to buy a car . in the future 20 year , the number of these group of people will grow bigger so there would be more car in developing country in twnety year . secondly , in developed country , most of the family have their own car . cars play a very important part in people 's livy . people will feel very unconvenient if they do not have a car . this situation will change little in twenty year . although scientist ha created many kind of new tranfic machine , none of them could take the place of car . cars have influence people 's livy so significant that it is impossible to change the situation in twenty year . thirdly , the style of car may change a lot in the future . it is true that resource on the earth are declining very fast . it is also possible that one day we would have no petrol to fill our car . however , i believe that human being can find new resource used for car to take the place of petrol . in fact , nowadays there are many car which use electricity . i think this techology will be very useful in twenty year . it is much more practical and cheaper to improve the car than to creat a totally new trafic machine to solve the resource problem . cars have served people all around the world for nearlly 100 year . car industry and car science have improved a lot in these year . i think scientist could find out new way to make car more useful , more suitable , more clean and more popular . to sum up , it is very possible that there will be more car in use than there are today .
