cars are used more and more common in today , especially in china . obviously using car brings great conveniernt to life , but i think the whole number of the car will reach the peak in the future and then decrease . in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all , the car use oil to run , but the amount if oil resource is limited in the earth . the price of original oil in the international market keep raising . in the future , the cost of owning a car will be much higher than today , peole will change their way of transport . secondly , too many car cause too many traffic problem . in many big city , traffic jam is nomal . during the day of busy time , people can not take advantage by using car , they are blocked in the car by the illusion of the traffic . maybe one can walk to the the place he want faster than using a car . and while the city be devoloped , the taffic system can be designded more efficiently , people can use more and more cheap and conveniet tool to reach the palce they want not only by car . another question is considerable that no matter how modern the city is , the space is limited ,, if everyone use a car , the outcome is out of imagination . cars product most of the waste gas that polluted the air and make the weather get warmer and warmer . in reccent year , the average temperature incresed a lot . if we still use so many car , putting off so many waste gas , one day all of the ice-moutain will turn into water then all of the island and some part of the continent will sink under water . no one can measure the lost and how could we find another place for human to live except of the earth ?
