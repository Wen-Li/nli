i disagree with thoose who think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , because it is a cheap way to travel , car is very comfortable and with the car you can reach almost of all place in the world . first of all i think that travlel with car is cheaper than other way of travel like plane , train or boat . the reason is that if you want to travel with your car you have to spend money only for the oil and for the highway . consequently the money that you will spend is lesser than the money that you will spend for a ticket for a boat or a plane or a train in this way for example you can save some money for the journey or for other thing . second , in my opinion , travel with your car is more comfortable that travel with other travel way , because modern car have all optionals like satellite navigator , that is a modern device that allow you to not lost yourself in city or country that you do n't know , comfortable seat , computer on board and many others . furthermore car is comfortable because you can leave home and arrive to the place decided whenever you want . consequently you do n't have to wait in a station because of train or plane delay , for which you will arrive late for example to a date . third , i think , that with the car you can reach all location around the world and you will have the liberty to choose to way that you prefer to reach it without any limitation . in conclusion i think that for the reason that car is a cheap transport way that is comfortable and useful to reach almost of all place in world , the car will not be fewer in twenty year than today .
