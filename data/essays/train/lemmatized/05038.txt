times are changed . people do not understand that young people are not like their father . is true that those young men do not help their comunities in the way that in twenty century we refer to , but is true olso that they have differents and importants job . the first think that , for my opinion , a young person must do is study for his future , and , in a cert way , this must be seen like a help for the comunity , becouse a grait education can improve our future , can improve our worker , our economy and our life , so this is important not only for young person but collective future too . and i see like my family beelive in this opinion , in fact they support me in all of my decision , they , in ather word , built my future . and i see always in them a lot of proude for me . i know that is important make samethink for ather people , but there are a lot of young peolple that make a civil servise , they help comunity , for example , a lot of them work in hospital without pay . probably they are not a sufficient number , but is wonderful that in a time like our there is in them also a sentiment of generocity e charity , and i do not care if sameone think that this new generation is without value , becouse for my opinion a generetion that make in first place their future own and their uman feeling is a grait generation . of course there are olso same of them that do not want anythink for athers or for themself , and that do not have respect for parent-s sicrifice . but i think that they are a little grup of a wonderful generetion , which i in it and i can tell this with proude .
