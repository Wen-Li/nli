i disagree with this statement that nowadays young prople do not give enough time to helping their community . although there are a lot of news about how rediculous young people thought like in tv medias and newspaper , we still can see some warm event arroud our life . in my own country , taiwan , it is very hard to see what young prople do nowadays , because the political news and international relationship with china are filled all of our news program . but in recent event of deposing our president chen , many university student used their idea to support this demonstration instead og using violence to insist the goveronment . some young people made conference to discus the solution of taiwan in the future , some young people made some file to express their thinking , and some young people just became member of this event . i remembered seeing the rescue the people in destruction by tunami in the east-south asia in 2004 , there are many scene that young people from various countris went to refuge to help them for living . there is still `` love '' in people , especially among young people . and we also see a lot of young people still concern many issue of our globe , like pollution , recycling , and animal protecting , etc . i think that there are still a amont of young people give enough time to really helping their communitis , and we do not know this information just because our medias in many country doe not care about this issue . we can say that medias are almost hold capitalism for their only principle to earn money , so the most attractive news almost about sex , violence , and muder . so we can not just conclude the young people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their community . that is i want to say .
