i would say i gree . because life is yours . and who can be make your life ? depends on having fun life or not is your choice . no one cant decided . and you cant say that if you had bad life in the young time and you will get a great life after getting order. a life make it your owan had and your action . if older people saying that young people enjoying their life that them and comlain about that mean they ( older people ) couldnt make their life fun . if they had been could , they didnt . they didnt have a gut and braive to do it . and , for those older people to enjoying life not too late . dump the jerousy to the young people , and get your own life . when old people were young maybe they had soo much fun to satisfy their soul . and if there were not all enjoying , mean if you try something that you interented and you make mistake , you will be learn something from it . there is nothing worthless . so you can have a lot of fun and what ever if it good or bad , it helos you to grown up when you get older you will be a better life with ton of great eperiences . a life is short . to spending woth time and somethig that you really want to do , you shouldnt put them off . take a chance and make an action . you shouldnt regret . so , i think that young perople can having fun life more than older people .
