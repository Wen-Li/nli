if we happen to consider this issue from an academical point of view , it seems plausible to exemplify it in a classroom environment . say , we have two class , class a and class b. the kind of education based on fact and the kind of education based on understanding and concept being followed in each , respectively . and let 's compare these two environment and the student in each , in term of motivation , creativity and success . firstly focusing on motivation , let 's consider the eve of a certain class . knowing that a certain subject will be covered the next day , and relying on that they will have a resource , here this resource being the teacher , citing the mere fact about that subject , the student in class a wo n't see it necessary to learn that certain thing in advance . while on the other hand , the student in class b will try to learn that same certain subject in advance , do some research and go to school a prepared a they can be to contribute to the discussion and idea floating throughout the class . secondly , in term of creativity , the student in class b will outdo their counterpart in class a , a well . while trying to learn the subject in advance , being motivated a explained in the paragraph above , they will resort to different resource . class a student benefiting from a single resource , will nearly be transformed into bird of a feather , thinking paralelly , while class b student will come to the class being affected from different point of view on the same subject . and that same day so happens to be prone to create new idea . thirdly and finally , well nourished with novelty caused by inspiration , class b student will try to outdo one another and easily reach success . while on the other hand class a student will be noshing on fact that have already been achieved by some elderly folk before them .
