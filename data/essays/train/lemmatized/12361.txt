the question say that `` it is more impotant for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . i agree with statement because , `` in this computing world student are becoming machinary day by day . they are not getting the idea and concept behind the subject . they are simply remembreing the thing to produce in the future . but i am sure that this will not improve the student 's knowledge and his skill in future and also the student will not be known how to survive in this world after his education '' . and it is the responsibilty of the parent and teacher to move the student in correct path . they should encourage the student to study in his interested field . and if the student is not listening to the parent , then they should give the clear idea to the student what will be the situation if you do a small mistakeand how it will help you in the future . if possible they should show him the consequenses practically . so that the student can understand what is the situation and where he is standing in this competing world . and more over the student future totally depends on the the idea and concept that he ha in his mind from his child hood . the student must be cleared with his every doubt which he ha . because when he is cleared with the doubt ( what ever he ha in mind ) he can understand the situation very clearly and the parent should give more example to explain his doubt clearly so that he can move in a correct path . so finally it is more important for the student to undersatnd the idea and concept than to learn fact . when the student get the idea and concept for the subject with many example then he can get the new idea of the same topic in an efficient way and is very easy to remember also .
