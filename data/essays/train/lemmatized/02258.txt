i disagree with the stated idea . i think there will be more car in use in twenty year from now . cars have been one of the indispensible transportation since they were invented . and even though there have been many other transportation system were developed , such a subway and airplane , car never been out of people 's life . instead of being replaced by other transportation system , they have changed to better version contionously . moreover , some people are very interested in buying or collecting old version of popular car , like classic model of `` beatle '' . cars may be considered just a a mean of moving . but purpose of owing a car ha changed over time , and nowadays some want car to show their life style and personality . for this reason , there will be more car in the future . however , it 's possible that new and better mean of transporting will be invented in the future , but i believe that car will be developed to be a better mean than now . as we 've been doing this for a long time , we can find better resource for power , and also better design for car . also there will be more car considering peole 's taste today . living in a modern world , many people prefer to stay private wherever possible and want to feel at home whenever possible . in that point , car are the best way to choose . i predict that fancier , more comfortable , faster , and safer mean of moving than car will appear in twenty year . even if it happens , i 'd choose to stay with my own car . cars have been one of the most attractive thing people can have , and i believe people wo n't be able to resist the urge of buyig a new car and driving on the street .
