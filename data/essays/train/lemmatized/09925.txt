i would disgree with this statment having the broad knowledge of many acaemics subject than to specialise in one specific subject because everyone would have their own choice of subject , so they prefer to be specialised in that particular subject . notonly that many of the student would have grip over particular subject . it becomes difficult for the student to understand the unfamilier subject it would distracts them from their regular course . for an example if we consider the undergraduated student who have undergone his study practicular field of subject such a computersciences , communication etc . these undergraduted student who undergone specific course would prefer to take specialisation in particular subject since they have know about the subject . if the student of computer would prefer to the broad knowledge about the electronics then that student face a problem because that would be the unfamilier subject , where he have to learn basic this would distracts him from his regular course . if we prefer to be specialised in the particular subject of our intertest then we could learn more about the subject i.e from basic to the recent development . we would may much attention towards the subject and also show much enthusiasm in that specific subject because it is the subject of our interest . knowing everything about particular subject is better .
