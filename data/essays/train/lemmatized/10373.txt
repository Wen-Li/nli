before thinking about the truthfullness of advertisement , one ha to distinguish between the different form of advertising . to keep this essay short i will focus on two form , informative advertising and emotional advertising . emotional advertisement try to connect certain emotion and a certain image with a specific product . for example marlborough cigarette have always been associated with freedom . because of this definition of emotional advertising , it can not be truthfull or untruthfull . people will buy a product because it evokes certain feeling and emotion . in effect the advertisement of certain product is actually part of the product itself . the reason for this is that most people would not buy a product such a a louis vuitton handbag if it would n't have an image of luxury connected to it . this image of luxury is only upheld by advertisement . only the customer know at the end if the image and the emotion they acquired are a good a suggested by the advertisement . i do not think this can be generalised in emotional advertisement . informative advertisement on the other hand informs the potential customer about a certain product , in order to convince them that it is the best product they can get . this form of advertisement can of course be truthfull or untruthfull . by witholding fact about a product or by actually lying about a product it is possible for firm to get an advantage over their competitor . but in general , lie do not last very long . it is not wise for company to raise expectation they can not uphold . if a company dissapoints it customer they will never buy this company product again . in my opinion company exaggerate the benefit of their product only so much a is expected by the customer . customers expect advertisement to be moderately exaggerated and are not dissapointed if they buy such a product . so in my opinion advertisement do not make product seem much better than they are , because customer expect advertisement to be exaggarated .
