the life of youngster have changed a lot throughout the year . some people agree that young people do not give enough time to help their community nowadays . in my opinion , young people do not help their communuties a much a they use to , because they think that they have better thing to do like the use of technology and studying . technology ha driften apart child from their community . the smallest community is a family and some young people do not even help their family anymore . for example ; their is a huge difference between my mother and i . she always tell me story about how she use to help her mother with the house work and chore since she had nothing else better to do . i do not get involved in these kind of event that much aroung the house because of the technology that surround me . i am so busy watching tv , or playing video game , or talking on the phone that i do not realize some of the thing that go on around the house . technology is one of the reason child today do not help their community that much anymore . studying ha been an important fact on why kid can not help their community a much a they use to a well . the amount of work and the subject taught in school have changed so much lately that kid sometimes have to study all day long . for example ; my school give out a lot of homework for one night and it take me quite a number hour to finish it , and by the time i am done it is time to go to bed , but my mother tell me that in her time they didi not have that many homework so when they finished they had the time to help around in the house or in their neighborhood . kids do not understand that sometimes helping people or helping a community is the best thing you can do in your life . as a result , young people have to move away from the technology that ha been drifting them apart from their community , and they have to be taught to study with a program so it will not take that much . helping people is much more important than watching tv or studying .
