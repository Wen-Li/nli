i believed that successful people are those who try new thing and take risk rather than involving in thing that they have alrealy know . first , a person who is very enthustiac to learn new thing ha certain advantage . because of his willingness to take risk this individual will learn enough in his or her experience regardless of the outcome . for example , a good businessman is an individual who is available to try a new business or a sell of a product in different geographical area , if he succeed then he ha the chance to prolifere his business and attract more customer , however , even if he doe not succeed he can still learn from his mistake and adopt new strategy and start all over again and be more prepared . second of all , i believed that if a person never try new to experience new thing , you will never be able to measure your capacity . for example , when i wa very young i wa really reserved in many activity such a sport , activity that involved speaking in public . for instance after a lot of pratice in a soccer team i coud not believe the level that i wa able to achieve and how proud my family and my friend were . futhermore , i always admired people who had the potential of speaking in public . after my experience in class presentation i wa overwhelmed to see that i could convey a message that my listerners understood find a good motivation behind my story . third , in a more scientic prospective , i believe that science ha evolved because certain researcher and individual have engaged in trying new thing . for instance , today people are able to hold long distance conference thanks to techology , this technology spare business a considerable amount of expenes . also , other sugery can also be performed in two different location , a person suffering some disease where treatment is not avaible can take advantage of the knowledge of another physician in different location . in conclusion , trying new thing is beneficial because it can help u discover our capacity and make u more productive for our society . those who have taken certain risk in science have allowed to solve problem in our world either medical , economical or social .
