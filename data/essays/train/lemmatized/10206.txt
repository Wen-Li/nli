there are several way of travelling to many different kind of destination . people could travell in group lead by tour guide , by themselves , with a partner . i believe that the best way to travell varyes completely on the destination of the trip . if a american doe not know how to speak japanesse is taking a trip to japan , it would not be advisable for him to go by himself . in that situation i would much rather prefer to travell in a group with a tour guide who obviously speaks japanesse . another case scenario would be an american person travelling to hawaii were it languaje is spoken . of course it would not hurt to have a tour guide who know the place to show this person around but if the purpose of the trip is heading to the beach to relax and enjoy , no tour guide should be necessary . i would travell with someone other than a tour guide . in conclusion , i do not fully desagree with the statement nor fully agree with it . i firmly believe that the best way to travell depends on the destination and the circumstance of the trip .
