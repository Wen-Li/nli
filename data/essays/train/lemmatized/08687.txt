sometimes , people like to be alone and they imagine to go abroad by themselves . on the contrary , i like to travel by group because it is more beneficial for the novice of traveling . by group traveling , we can save more time and money . in addition , we can gain good information from a tour guide . the first benefit of group tour is time . we can save lot of time in group tour because a guide know where we should go next . for example , if i get to a place , i probably waste lot of time to find a parking lot . last year i visited the historical place of dallas , tx , where j.f.kennedy had a shot . i spent for 30 minute to find proper place to park . in addition , we are to lose direction . the second reason is the financial . the group tour doe not require gas or parking fee . for instance , my family visited new york and niagara fall three year ago when we stayed in chantly , virgina . they chareged u only 450 dollar each person . we had great tour around there for four day . before the tour , i calculated the amount of tour a person . it wa 700 dollar . lastly , we can gain good information from a guide . they are well educated about the traveling . when i had a tour new york , a guide showed me that how puritan settled down in plymouth and how new york became the center of world trade . when he said the life of new yorkers , especially immigrated from my country korea , i could understand their pain in life . as i listed above , i prefer to have a group tour because it save time , money and allows me to have good knowledge about traveling place . of course , i had a experience about traveling with only my wife to washington d.c. last year . i think it wa possible to have a tour without a guide because d.c. had very good and convenient transportation .
