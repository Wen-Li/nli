this is a difficult and very interesting important statement . in order to answer the question we have to consider the advantage and disadvantage of car and we have to diucuss the attitude of the people in view of car , traffic , air pollution . .. on the on hand i do not agree with the statement . everyone ha a car , the people live longer than today and so there will be more driving-people . another reason is that a car is nothing special - fifty year ago a car wa something unbelieveble - it wa a wonder and only a few people were able to have a car . only a few people were able to buty a car or had the driver licence . at the moment most people have the driver license and it is easy to have a car without much money . there are many possibillities to get a car without earning much money , for exemple by pating step by step or by renting a car - and i think this fact will be increase in the next year and will be much stronger than today . but on the other hand i agree with this statement , and i hope it will be correct - this would be very very important for u , our body our healthy our nature and our planet !!! fistly i think that the people are more sensible with our nature . we all know that there are many problem caused by u . the problem increase day by day and and the people are more heaten with ithem than twenty year ago , and i think in twenty year they will care more than today . they will not take the car unneccessary , such a driving from one shop to the other , they will walk more . another exemple is to drive allone - they will meet their job friend anb drive together , this will be cheaper . secondly the community help to reduce car . in is very difficult to find a parking place in the city - so it would be much better to drive by bus . finally the governement help to reduce the car with the very very high tax for having a car , for driving a car and for the gas . to sum up i can say there are many reason for reducing the amount of car . and personally i belive that all people are interestet in our nature and healthy , so that the number of car will gradually discrease .
