i agree with the topic that it is important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . student should learn the concept of any subject so that he can use that concept to impliment in practical point of view . for example if student ha a concept on something he can use that concept for many application in that subject . learning fact is also very important for the student because he can understand thing with that fact . but understanding idea and concept is very important for the student than learning the fact . learning the concept is not constant for student but learning the fact is constant for a student . the reason that it is important for the student to understand idea and concept is by knowing that the concept he can use these concept for many thing in that subject . student may forget the fact but once he learns the concept he will not forget for ever . learning concept is very important for a student . leaning concept for the student play the vital role for his career than learning the fact . once student get the concept or idea on the subject he will use that concept for many depending application . finally i agree with the following statement the it is important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact .
