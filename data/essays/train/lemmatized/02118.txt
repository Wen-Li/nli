in modern statistic , 90 % of the public prefer to study specific knowledge . in my openion , to suporte this , it is better to have specialize and specific knowedge for several reason . you will be able to organize your think , focus on specific detail and increase the opportunity to offer a jub for every body . first of all , if a student took chemestry a a his own major he is not going to be buildired between the other material such a physics , history etc . so , his think will be related to chemestry and he is going to be successful with his major . secondley , the student want to success in his major by giving his concentration to the material he study . as we can see , the student will be capable in his major . if he took music a a major beside chemestry , he is going to struggle with these different science . these day , everybody want a specific job . so , if we give everybody the broad knowledge , all of them become qualified at the same rate which mean lacking the chance to have a perfect job . on the other hand , if we have student who are specialist in different knowledge , the oppourtunity to hav of , course , a job will increase
