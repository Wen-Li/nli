since the end of the nineteen century , the expansion of car is increased all over the year . the need to move from a town to another or the pleasure of driving had produced a big market and economic system . could you imagine the evolution in a few year ? what could be the number of car in twenty year ? in fact , the real question is if the car will be fewer or not in the next year . firstly , we live in an economic system based a lot on the petroleum industry . the main energy of car , today , is the petrol . have fewer car in a few year would say we need to be more independant about this energy and develop other sort of energy . the decrease of the number of car will be possible only with economical change and also policy reglementation . secondly , our road network is sometimes saturated . i ca n't imagine where we could put the others car into the traffic jam . we can imply to build other road . but this ca n't be indefinitly . now we could in this term have some car additionaly but in a way , it ha to stop a day . end thirdly , people are more and more sensitive to the environment . lot of them go to work in common transport or in bicycle . people had some car but do n't use it in the same way than few year ago . the cost of car are also a barrer , not only the aquisition but also the training on it . people do n't want car or ca n't buy them . to conclude , i hope that in twenty year , we can breath without carbon and pollution , that 's why i hope that policy and economic system will change and encourage the development of common transport like bus , tramway , metro and so on . i think also that people are ready to change their car culture . in fact it is now the decision of a pollution way or an oxygen way for our planet .
