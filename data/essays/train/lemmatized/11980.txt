in today 's highly mobilized society , car have become an indispensible part of daily life . it is now common in most family to have multiple car , one for each member of the family . however , while enjoying the innumerable advantage that car bring to their life people are becoming more and more aware of the down side of having so many car . considering this point , i agree with the statement that there will be fewer car in the future than there are today . the biggest price that today 's society are paying for the convenience of having so many car is definitely the deteriorating environmental condition . cars probably have the largest contribution to air pollution among all the technological advancement that we can think of . in the recent year , on the other hand , environmental awareness ha been awakened by mean of international treaty , scientific research and public advertising . in my opinion , therefore , these effort will have far reaching consequence and make future generation more sensitive on the issue . what effect an individual directly , however , is not the global environment that he must do his part to protest but more than that the expense that come along with having a car . as the organic energy source on the planet diminish , oil price will keep increasing , possibly at higher rate . in the end , it will probably reach such to limit where people will be willing to give up their comfort in favor of their pocket . the final point that i 'd like to make to support my argument is the gigantic technological advencement that we are witnessing in the field of computer and the internet . nowadays , one can work , buy , sell , communicate , read the daily paper and do much more on his computer without leaving the house . this , however inadvantageous it might be for the health of the society , will surely have an effect in cutting down the number of car that people have . after all , what 's the point of having a car if you are only going to use it once a year to take it to the mechanic for it annual check ?
