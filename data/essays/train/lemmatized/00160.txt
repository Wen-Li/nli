i partly agree with the statement that the use of car will dicrease in twenty year . however , it can be thought that the thechnology of car will improved and more people would want to use . nowadays , we have so many public transportation and other kind of vehicle besides car . for example , my community recomands to use public transpotation rather than using own car . the reason is that the many use of car will cause global warming and air pollution . if people use public transportation together , it would help keeping air cleaner than using own car . in addition , there are other vehicle bisides car such a a air plain and fast train . the air pain wa one of the suprising invention for himan being . however , thesedays , we often use it , in fac , tmore than before . the cost of it got cheper than before and easier than before . therefore , many people have oppotunity to use air plain in even short trip . however , the car technology is being imploved everyday . the car company try to produce more useful and high ability car . as global warming problem and air pollution problem are caused by the emittion of chemical element from car , the car company try to find new energy source such a h2 . moreover , many of system of car are improved for people to use so easy and convinient , it can be said that more people want to have car . today , it is difficult to live without having car to . as long a the car is improved collect way and nice to the environmment , the car use is not dicrease but should be increase .
