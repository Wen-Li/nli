i believe that , it is never good to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . you always get the best when you specialize in one specific subject . specializtion in one particular subject that help you build your career will not only bring interest during the study but will also give you the satisfaction when working through it . first let me state that generally all the subject are vast , and studying these vast subject in which a person is not interested may lead to improper knowledge about the subject . as an old saying saying say `` half knowledge is always dangerous '' , it would turn dangerous . furthurmore no person could cover all the thing in all the subject in a given academic time . practically , a doctor ha to go through those subject that are totally different from what a biologist go through . a doctor ha 5 year of academic time to study and master all the thing about the human body and a biologist ha around 3-4 year to study about all the animal . now if a person thinking to have a broad knowledge and knowing all the subject in this 5 year , is it possible for the person to master either of these ? he would neither become a perfect doctor nor a good biologist . in general keeping academic time aside , interest of person matter a lot . he must be focused on what he is interested . most of the people they will not be interested in all the sujects , say , i never liked math and programming , i always liked biology , now will a person like me , will he be interested in learning all the other sujects effectively say math ? he will concentrate on only those subject that yield him benefit , it like when a person go furthur in his career would the other subject really help him ? its mere waste of time , if this time is utlilized for improving his knowledge in the field he is interested , this would help him better for his career , and in career job satisfaction is always much more important than any other thing . let u consider a biotechnologist , his work is discovering new vaccine , relating pathology etc. , if he would have learned law during his academic would that thing really help him in any way ? there are other people who can do that job efficiently than this person who is not at all interested in doin that job . so for this reason too i say that having proficiency in a particular subject is always better than wasting time in learning all the unnecessary stuff and having a broad knowledge of the academic subject . finally , the implication in the passage would state clearly that , it is not important for a person to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject , but it really very good for a person to gain profieciency in one particular subject that help him inbuilding his career and do better in his job , in all required aspect . its always good be a master instead of calling ourselves `` the jack of all trades but master of none '' .
