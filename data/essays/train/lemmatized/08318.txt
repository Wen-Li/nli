iam absoultely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do and iam sure that this is true because i find my self happier when i wa younger than this moment for the following factor . fir of all , when i wa young i never thought about the toughness of the future and what i should and i should not do . for example when i wa younger i wa like to play with lego but now my look from the people eye will be so different than past that they would criticise me and maybe they would insult me by doing that . moreover , it wa le responsibility that my goal wa only paying and playing but now i have to think about my foot step and the result of my step . forexample , i have to decide which university i will enroll and which feild i have to go and how to make a privilaged life with great fortune . what is more , i can see the world by simple eye when i wa young . forexample when i see the enemy and the invasion in my country or neighbored country i say that i can solve the problem and be like superman but this time i afraid to either think about that thing . the range of entairtanment when i wa young more than now . forexample i wa visiting my friend and watch tv and playing electronic game like playstation but now i tell my self i must not to waste my time by these silly thing and think about such a the project that my teacher want from me . to sum up my essay i think that the statement is difinetly true that young people will enjoy life more than older people do but i have to admit that being mature and man who is dependable ha agreat constructive point in my life such a getting the freedom .
