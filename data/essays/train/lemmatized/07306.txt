eversince the last century , the car , introduced by the worldwide-best-seller ford-t in the twenty , ha become the most popular mean of transportation . and nowadays it ha even become more than that . actually , the car is now much more than just a mean of transportation , it ha become a real social attribute , the bigger your car is , the higher you are on the social ladder . reducing the number of car doe not only implies a change in our habit of transportation but a complete change in the way we think . another example of the way the car ha influenced our society are the american city . the way these city are built is nearly an ode the car . .. it 's too difficult to move without a car , but that doe n't matter because car are still cheap in the us . i do n't think twenty year will be enough ( a genration is twenty-five year ) for our socity to change . however , some issue could help . indeed , the environment and particularly the global warming have become major issue for our planet , and the car is one of the biggest pollution source on the planet . furthermore , the planet is running out of oil , implying an expensive energy , and that 's becoming more and more a problem . however i am not worried for the future of the car , because new technology will overcome these diffculties . we are nearly entering a new era , electric or even hyrogen engine will soon be availiable , leaving a bright future to the car . cars wo n't disappear , they 're just entering into their revolution , that 's it . when i wa young i used to think that aliens existed , well actually i do think they exist , and i thought that the first thing they 'll see when arriving on earth would be our road and our car moving at any time of the day and night . for sure they would think that the inhabitant of earth would be car . .. why would you want the inhabitant of earth to disappear ?
