i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . to discus it , i need to difine the meaning of `` successful people '' for me . successful people are people who found out their meaning of life . to discover it , the process of seeking is neccessary . the process is the same a trying new thing . trying new thing take risk . i call people who are doing same thing without taking risk a `` unsuccessful people '' . it is because they do not live their life thoroughly . they already stop seeking . it mean they are loosing their chance to find the meaning of life . it is difficult to find out what is the best thing to do for them . therefore searching it is very important factor for thier success . for example , michael jodan , one of the most famous basketball player in the world , wa used to be a baseball player when he wa a child . when he entered high school , he started to play basketball . then he realized it wa the best thing to do for him . however , he wa not sure about he could become a professional bascketball player . but he tried it and made it . he retired already , but everyone of basketball fun remenbers him vividly . another example is roger federer , no.1 tennis player in the world . like michael jordan , he also did not know he wa good at tennis until he became a journior high school student . he wa not a strong player before then . finally , a i stated above , i believe trying new thing with taking risk are important element for successful people . life is not an easy thing . to succeed in the real meaning , i have to keep serching the meaning of it .
