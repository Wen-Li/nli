i agree completely with this statement . i think there are various argument to support it . to begin , the growing number of car is becoming a problem nowadays . in some city , like london , they tried to find a solution to reduce the number of user by asking a fee to drive into the city . having so much car in a confined area brings a lot of problem like pollution , parking problem , accident without even thinking about the fact that so many car consume a lot of fluel . speaking of , it 's abundance is dropping dangerously , and of course the price is equally expanding . it 's becoming a luxury to drive now . maybe there will be a restriction at some point , that allows each person to drive a certain amount of time in a week . this could encourage people to drive with friend or colleague to a work place for example . thanks to this , fewer car will be in use every day ! i 'm actually wondering if certain firm could give money to people who fill up their car to drive to work . this could even bring people closer together . if you watch sciencefiction movie , you quickly realise that in most of them , there are not even car ! the car have been replaced by some kind of machine flying around . perhaps some scientist are currently trying to come up with new idea to replace car in a environmental friendly way . a easier way to reduce the number of car would also be to expand hugely the different form of transport like train , bus and subway in a way that car will become unnecessary . if people realise that it 's easier , cheaper and faster to go anywhere by train , bus or subway , car will become useless . sadly , this is still not the case nowadays . certains area are to remote to acces them by any other way than by car . it is still easier and safer a well to ride home with the car in the middle of the night . anyway , i 'm curious how the mean of transport will evolve during the next year .
