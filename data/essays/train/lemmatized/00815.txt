from my point of view , it would be really an impressive option to have the better knowledge of many academic subject . as far a i 'm concerned i think it would be splendiferous in improving several academic topic , besides they could increase the general knowlege and also creates splendid improvement in the case of different subject skill . but in the case of a unique subject provides the improvement in only one subject . in this instance , let 's consider an example , if we presume a student who is concentrating in only one subject , consider political science . he might be thorough in only his concerned subject then he might not get any additional skill towards other subject . when in the case of another student who is concentrating in different kind of subject , in this hypothetical case the student definitely get familiar in many topic that he had read . if we presume some of the topic choosen by the student would be from software engineering technics , embedded system , japenese literature , data mining and ware housing . .. so on , through his streunous attempt towards learning thse topic would yeild him several sponteneous achievement by educating him inthose subject . so educating in so many academic subject would overweigh towars the result brought up by the single subject , because the specialization on many academic subject output the spectacular and magnificient and picturesque result . and student must feel amour propre towards him . eventually , i conclude that taking several academic subject in order to get specialization in some subject all at a once such a , political science , japanese literature , software engineering technique , embedded system , data mining and warehousing , the student would get the out standing benifits by getting skill , rather than the student practicing in only one subject . eventhough he could get the broad knowle
