now a day the way of gaining knowledge changed verymuch for the student . some will prefer to learn by understanding the idea and concept . some will prefer to learn by facing the fact . it 's depend upon the age of the student also . if i were asked i 'll definitely prefer the idea of learning fact . the reason for this is , it can last for a long time . it will be useful to the student in the future field of work . the student have very le chance to commit the mistake also . learnig the fact make the student to think practically and also allowed them to think independently . now a day if we take any eductaion system it is going on the wrong track in some country . the school and college are not giving much chance to the student to think practically . they encourage the spoonfeeding . even for the small thing also he need to depend on the their teacher . because of competition they forced the student to understand the concept and idea . if a student learn the concept by facing it or experiencing it it will be last very long time in his mind . learnig the fact also make student to be very efficent in the future field of work . here the student can easily implement whatever he learnt in the student day . he can distinguish among many people . here his job will be very easy to him . another thing is that student have very small chance to commit any mistake . because he learned by his own experience he wo n't commit any mistake . from the above cited point i conclude that the student who learned by understanding the fact will definitely efficient than the others . however it may be time taking proces for a studnet to learn by facing the fact i 'll definitely prefer the concept of learning by facing fact .
