i agree with the statement . i will chose the group travel led by tour guide . first , using a tour guide take u le time to search the detail of the place we will visit and the way how to go there . if we do n't have enought time to study them , this become a convinient way to travel . secondaly , a tour guide may know the special place which ordinay tourist do n't know . i think it is very difficult to find out the place which local people only knonw good . so if we travel led by a tour guide , we may more appriciate the tour . fainaly , travel led by a tour guide provides u with more safly tour . for example , foreign country travel is the case . when we go to the country , if we do n't know what the language spoken or how safe the region is , that may ocuur some dangerous situation . so , if we do n't have a confidence we get along with them , using a tour guide is good selection .
