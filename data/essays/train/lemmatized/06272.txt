i think it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in the shcool , teacher always instruct about the truth that student must know at least to become the adult and to go to the society . however , some subject which taken in the school is in vain . and they also limited the child 's identication . first , understanding idea and concept give student to creativity that they can even think and imagine well for their world . if sutdents did not understand idea and concept of any subject they will fail that class because they got confused what thecher said . also giving the fact must be really boring that they would never try to think about the future . second , when student become the adult and working in anywhere , they will work well with their frexible brain which make the final good dicision what they must do .
