societies are bound together with the common value within their sharing and respect element . however , young people are not struggling for understading their community . for this reason , it is possible to argue that youth is the key element for understanding the combining value of a community however they are lack of this responsibility . three important reason for this problem are the existence of variety in activity , people becoming more individual and lack of guidance from university . one of the main problem of youth not to give attention to community occurs with the variety of activity that they can participate . existence of many attractive activity , social center and even university club make young people to choose one of the thing that they like . for instance , if a student like ceramic and learns an associated club in his university , he will possibly choose to perform his interest . this situation can be applied to many university student in which they are regretting the need of community help but rather choosing to accomplish their individual need . secondly , because of the technological improvement and it achievement in reaching every person , people started to think more individually and for their own seek . for instance , the introduction of the internet to people especially stopped young people to take place in society and to communicate with each other . rather they spend their time surfing in the internet just looking for their own interest . because of this developing structure among the youth , it becomes harder to expect them in enrolling civic involvement work . with the existence of many tool forcing youth to become alone and individual , the le respect for the community would occur . universities are the most important center for young people to shape their charachters but guidance for community work is missing in most of the university . rather university started to become institution a a key figure for job application and better living condition . recent information also show that university are trying to affect student by their success rather than enforcing community value . as a result , lack of guidance towards community work also triggles the youth to become individual . as a result , young people are rather studying and behaving for their own good . in the increase of this event there are important step like university behavior and technological improvement . but it is very important to reduce this behaviour of the youth for the common good of the society .
