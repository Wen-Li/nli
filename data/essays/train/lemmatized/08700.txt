i completely agree with this statment . in my opinion , education and learning ha a great more impact on the student if the subject touch them emotionaly and personally . learning fact and reciting thing memorized form textbook can achieve nothing for the student except from giving them a shallow concept of education . as an example , i will present a personal experience of mine that ha actually happened to me . in one lesson of personal study , we , a a class , touched upon the subject of animal right . i never had any thought on this subject before and reading a essay written on the subject in a text book , i still had no idea and opinion on the subject . reading from the textbook established by the school gave me no understanding of the subject . but later on in the week the teacher took u on a trip to a animal shelter called the bspca . there , i saw animal that were actually under a lot of stress and animal that have been abused in the past . from that experience i learned a real lesson and actually understood the idea and concept behind the subject and from that i realized that what really is important in a lesson , is the amount you understand rather than learning fact and getting an a * on a test . this is parly why i think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . actually understanding a subject can help build character , history , personality and value in a character . on the other hand , learning fact from a textbook can only make a copy of an unoriginal being that belief in some one el view ( the person who wrote the fact , or a fact that ha no personal appeal ) . the major reason that make me believe that this statement is true is that the people around me and myself have many story to tell , and the reason that people have story to tell is because they have learnt , understood and experienced idea and concept that merily , definetly , did n't come from a textbook full of fact . in conclusion , i absolutely agree with with the following statement : `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' because of the several reason listed above .
