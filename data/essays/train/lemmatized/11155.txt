some people think that most advertisement doe n't make product seem much better than they really are because some people think the looking of product are more important then the quility of the product . however , in my opinion , i think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are three following reason which can prove and give more example for my persanal opinion . the most importand reason i think is that advertisement know what comsumer thinking when comsumver are shopping . the outside of looking of product is most point people will think to buy the product . therefore the advertisement speand more time to design what kind of looking of better for prodcuts then the time which they are design inside of product . this point can help counpany to get more money because they dont have to spand too much time on inside of product design , and cumsumer feel interesting on product looing , so they buy it . producing inside of product easier then making the good design for outside looking is the second important reason which i have chosen to put here . i wa doing a research paper which is about disguessing how many time people usually spend on designing a new car . the research show me that design a new car engige should speed more then five year at lessest . because it ha too many thing need to do for it , and sometime it ha some techengle gap which is hard to cross . however , the outside looking is easier to do compare with design inside . therefore , most off time the product seem much better than they really are . third , people usually care about the inside quility after they bought it . the thing for people to deside buy or not usually is outside looking . so people will complain the product when they bough it . however , in this point the company give cumsuners ' money alreay .
