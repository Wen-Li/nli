these day , there are the growing number of people tring to enjoy their life in various way . some peeple say the young people enjoy life more than older people do , while others disagree with this . in my oppinion , i disagree with the statement because i think the older people enjoy their life more than young people do by traveling the world and playing sevral kind of sport . first of all , old people enjoy their life by traveling many different country . as you may find on research of sevral tv station , the number of people traveling other country than thier own country are highly increasing every year , and most of them are senior who do not have particular job while other are busy to care their business than enjoying their life . due to they do not have their job to spend most of their time , they get a lot easier to travel arround and enjoy thier life . secondly , the older people enjoy thier life by playing many kind of sport . with the development of medicine and health supply , older people are getting much more stronger than before . these development help older people to maintain their body condition enough to participate many sport activity . for instance , i have seen many senior playing squarsh game very well while i work out at my fitness club . as i mentioned before , they have much more time than younger poeple who have to work hard to keep up thier job . thus , older people can spend more time to consider what kind of sport they like to learn , and how they are going to enjoy their life too . in conclusion , i disagree agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , i think older people enjoy their life more than young people do by traveling arround and learning and playing many sport . if people have more spare time when their are young , they can enjoy life more . however , they are still busy to work hard .
