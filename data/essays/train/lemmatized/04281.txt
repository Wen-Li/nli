i agree with it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact because if they understand the idea and concept , they may know the fact by their thinking , they may know the reason why of some other fact by their thinking , and they will make their own idea . first , i think if you really understand the idea , you may get the fact , because lot of thing happen with their own relationship . for example , if their is a new type of the computer show up , and the qunlity of the computer is so good , you may know that people will buy that computer , because people want to get the better computer . secoundly , if you know some of the idea , you may know why some of the thing have that fact , same example a last one , if the computer is really good , but people still do n't want to buy it , what 's the reason , you may think about other staff other than qunlity , like price , maybe the price of this computer is too high , by knowing the idea , you can think of why other fact had happened . last point , you may make your own idea by understand different idea . for example , you know the better qunlity and the cheaper price both can make people buying the computer , but you can n't get them both , so you may want to find the banlence of them to let people buy the computer . that 's the most important of understanding a idea , make your own idea . in coonclusion , i agree with that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , because knowing idea can give them the way to find the fact and know why some fact happened , and help them make their own idea .
