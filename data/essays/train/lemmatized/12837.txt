success is one of the courage that make people to take risk in the different layer of the life . i believe that sucessful people try new thing and take risk more easily comparision to the unsuccessful people . according to my view success encourages people and make people to handle the hardship of the new subject or the area that they are going to face with . for example paris hilton , one of the sucessful person in the world . she is not an actress , singer or movie maker but she take place different part of the art . in each part ` she becomes sucessful . she is very popular for now . she ha a single and people like her voice then she decided to be an actress . if she doe not sucessful in the music sector , she can not decide to be actress to act in a movie . but opposite to the paris hilton , bill gates who is the one of the sucessful person in the computer enginnering area , . he can not handle risk without calculating . thereby it doe not always seems that every sucessful people try new thing , some of them may choose only doing what they are already know how to do well . we might acknowledge that success make people to believe themselves . each successful job make them to believe that they are always taking right decision but i think it is only a belief . for example , arthur triumpth who is the owner of one of the biggest reat estate company in usa . but in the history he faced with very serious economical problem due to being a risk taker . after real state business he ha choosen to build a casiono and try to manage it . but he did not take a toughtful considiration about what might be happened and he had bankrupcy . consequently , success is one of the catolizer of life that lead u having chance to take risk . unless we take the risk we can not figure out the area that we are capiable of . may be success make u to concieve of about our choice . the example that are given above show that successful people are the pinooers for new thing and lover of risk .
