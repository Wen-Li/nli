the development of competition between company have created a war in the area of advertisement . nowadays , more and more advertisement have develop new strategy to catch the customer 's attention , although they are not a they appear ; in other word , producer of advertisement have had to improve their strategy being more and more creative and original , and even , trying to sell product that seem to be better than they really are , but they are not good enpugh . and that is because , in my opinion , there are n't regulation that help the customer to valid their right and to select the proper product without the influence of adverstisements . i think , goverments have to create , not only new regulation to the company , but also new instance where people who have purchased something wrong can demand for their right . that mean , goverments have to create politics that regulate what advertising company are doing and how they have to respond to thier customer . on the other hand , not only advertiser are culpable in this topic , customer have the responsability to buy thing that we really want , and realize that the last purpose of the adverstisements is to sell a much a they can , and not to think in the really need of people , or in the capacity of customer to pay for that . so , if you want to buy something , it is your responsability to see and select the correct product . although , advertisement can show you different product with their advantage and occult disadvantage , you have to be sbut at the end you are who have to select and buy what you really want and need . finally , if you want ot buy a product , try to think about what you really need and do n't pay attention of what advertisement give to you , because most of the time you do n't really need the product . i also will be better to see what you are buying , comparing the advertisement and the real look or weight , texture or taste .
