i agree with the statement that people these day are not devoting much time to help their community . including many other reason tenological advancement is main first of all , these day peple are becoming more and more isolated . they keep engaged with online friend who are country apart and dont know who their neighbor are . and if they dont know the member of his/her community how can one expect he will have the feeling to help out them in need . also , technical advance have have made him more confident that he wo n't require help from his community so he is also reluctant out his community a well . for instance if a person ha got an injury while doing some task at home he know that he is just a phone call away from hosital , an ambulance will be at his house in just few minute after the call . he dont require any help from his community member to help him out of this grave situation . furthermore these day people are too busy in their hectic , superpaced and hightech life that they even dont have time to think about other . for instance , a typical youth is busy in his project , class , seminar and to add on this his partime or weekend job , and a child rather than playing with other kid in park after completing his homework prefers to play computer or video game . how can one exopect that they can help their community member ? finally the growth in competiton ha forced human to aviod helping their community member , for eg a student would not wish to give his note to another student because that frightents him that he may joepardise his chance of getting higher rank . to sum up the tecnological advance , competition among the community member themselves , and their busy life all are the reason for a person being reluctant towards his/her community member .
