i partly agree and disagree with the statement . i agree with it because , a student need to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . and i disagree with the statement because all the student may not be having same intrest in all the academic subject . a student who ha broad knowledge in the academic subject can perform well in the furture study . it is neccesary that upto certain education period a student must have good knowledge in academic because in that way a he/she can learn more number of subject . . and find his own interested subject that are essential for human day to day life . and the disadvantage of making cumpulsory study of the academic subject are listed a follows , in the first case all the student may not cope up with the number of subject in a short period . some of them may be intrested only in a particular subject , . because of this a student may find an alternative for studying all the academic subject and he may also quit from the education field . and while studying these academic subject he will surely undergo some strain . . because of which there will be lot of health problem . so , i disagree with the statement i conclude saying that it is no doubt essential to have a broad knowledge on academic subject but that should be restricted to certain education period . i.e untill a student can decide where his intrest lie . also specialization in a particular subject may not be useful in all the case . i think both are necessary for a good academic profile . untill graduation he/she must need to have an broad knowledge on academic subject and later in their post graduation he/she can specialize in the subject they are intrested in . .
