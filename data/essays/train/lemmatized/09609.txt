taking risks mostly people are afraid to take risk in their life . they prefer to live in safe . that 's why they do not want to change their condition . but in my opinion people should take some risk to improve themselves . there are many people who are successful take a lot of risk . so successful people try new thing and take risk : although some peole think that they only doing what they already know how to do well . first of all , risk and new thing expand the vision of people , because every new thing and risk brings new experience . by this experience people can meet with different condition and solution . so their vision is changed according to their experience . for example ; my father is an engineer . when he graduated he went to germany for his intership . he worked a a worker in a building . during his intership , he experienced and analised how he could built a strong building . now he ha own company which is related with building structure . opponent argue that , successful people only doing what they already know how to do well . good production bring success . for this people should know how to do and improve it . in this way , they do not need to take risk or experience new thing , because they can maintain this from book . it is unlikely to be true . books are not enough for improvement , because they only include theoritical knowledge . in practice , experience is more neccessary instead of theorical knowledge . also by taking risk and trying new thing , people improve their experience . to sum up , if people want to be successful , they should try new thing and take some risk . by this , they can improve their ability such a problem solving ability . according to their experience and vision , they create their own practical solution .
