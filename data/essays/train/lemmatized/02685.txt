i agree with this statement although it is really hard to imagine that there should be fewer car in use in twenty year . during the last century the use of car ha namely grown enourmous , but i think that there will be a change soon beacuse car are getting more and more expensive and people are earning le money . soon most people will not afford a car any longer . the first problem is that in our century of unemployment you can not spectaculate that people will get more wealthy during the next time . maybe even more people will get unemployed . a result of this is the second problem , the fiscus need money to ensure that all of those unemployed people are able to survive . the fiscus ' most likely opportunity to get money is to higher tax and fee and because petrol is nothing you need to survive , the fiscus highers the petrol tax at first . petrol , which you need to use your car , is getting more expensive . the third problem is that our petrol-ressources are fading . in a few year there will be no more petrol to get and the price for the last rest will explode . the result is that petrol is getting more and more expensive , but in a very fast and rabiate way ! i know that there exist alternative for driving with petrol , for example using bio-diesel , solar/energy or a hybrid motor . but these technology have not still grown out and only few people can afford them . they can be further developed and they will be further developed , but this will need a lot of time ( more than twenty year ) . i think that in twenty year many people will have got rid of their car and will not look after petrol alternative but after car alternative ( public traffic ) like bus , tram or train .
