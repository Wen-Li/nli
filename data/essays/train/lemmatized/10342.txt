successful people are those who have achieved their goal or near to goal . some people are agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know and some people are disagree with this statement . i agree with these statement because of strong supporting point . successful people are having an habit to achieve goal . when they achived one particular goal they proceeding for new goal rather than doing what they already know . they always try to learned new thing from which they are unaware . if a succesful completed his ph . d in particular field instead fo stoping with that degree he try to go to research on another topic . these give him satisfaction about his new research and give deep knowledge about that topic . one of my friend mr. prakash , he is also a civil engineer , he passed his master in engineer from i.i.t. with me know i joined firm and contineud for job but he gone for phd , a he is scholar but now i said he also a successful person . successful people never thing about result they only know i have to start and i will achive the goal . i agree with these statement because instead of trying same thing try to go for new thing that will give u new knowledge . risk taking ability are always with th successful people . i am also also aware with risk taking ability and i am also taking risk in a particular topic to know about . because if i taken the risk in a particular field then i may passed or i may fail , but if i have not try or not taken risk , then surely i wont pas .
