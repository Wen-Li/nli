although a good basic and broad academic background is essential for any student in order to develop an understanding about his world and culture , gaining some specific experience and knowledge is the only way to make a student distinguish from others . based on the hard experience i am facing now while trying to find a job after completing my degree , i support the idea of speacializing and becoming unique . during the last year , the number of student who after school enters an university in my country ha amazingly increased . speaking about school education , i could choose among different field of study . i focused on a more cientific and tecnological one , what helped me to pas the access exam i needed in order to get the computer science degree i am holding now . once at the university , the firts course should be mainly oriented in offering more general and broad subject . in such a way , the student will have enough information to choose their major or future professional orientation . but a the education advance , the content of the subject should be divided into specific branch . by electing specific subject and lab , i got valuable knowledge and training that make a difference between my colleague when the time to get a job ha come . having more specialized employee also benefit company . it reduces competence and company spend le money in the selection process . employees do not suffer so much during the hard interview and feel more comfortable and sure about what the company expects from them . as an example , i only send my resume to those company whose job offer fit me . both the company and i are saving time and money . to recap , specializing student and making them valuable for specific task , should help them in the future to find a position in a company where they will feel usefull and suitable .
