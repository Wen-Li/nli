i agree with the statement because i have seen this event in many oportunities . there are important difference between successful people and no successful people . first , they are alweys doing new or different thing . second , they are taking risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . of course , there are n't only a success ' method , depend of the person and his/her situation but this is important . first , the successful people is notorious because usually they are doing thing news . for instance , when all the people are doing big computer , had people that are thinking about to do personal computer . steve wosniak , steve jobs and another people are doing meeting and club for to talk about big change in the world with the computer . they are thinking about building and selling personal computer . they found successful company such a apple and microsoft . so , they did thing new . second , the successful people are taking risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . this is true . for instance , when wosniak is bigining with his emprise he must decided about his job in hp . he loved his job and he wa loyal with hp but , he mu take the risk and to left his job in hp in order to found and wa working in this own emprise . he take the risk . he left his job and he found his own emprise and finally he had success .
