well i 'm not sure about this . i think i agree because it look obvious that nowadays , young people normally think more about theirselves , and do not really care about their community , at least most of them . they think it 's more interesting to do something that will give them a benefit at the moment , or soon , and for sure , than expending time in something that will give a small benefit to other people , and just maybe . but i also think that this is changing . each day i can see more young people who care more about their community , and help , probably because their parent have a different mind than the parent of the young people before , and teach them in a different way that they have to help . everyday i can see , for example , that they recicle , they dont throw trash to the floor , they care about politics and discus them , etc . but i also think they are just habit , they dont really do it with the intention of helping the community . so , it 's a good change because they help , but they still prefer to think more about theirselves . i think that to make them really change and want to help their community , they have to be interested in it , so they take it a a personal benefit . to make this , the community should organize interesting excursion for young people who help the community , or some kind of grant . this way i 'm sure that they will spend much more time in helping the community , while getting also benefit . so my conclusion is that i agree and also that if we want to change this , the community should change in some way too .
