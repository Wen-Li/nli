it is dificult to forecast the evolution of the use of car in twenty year , because it depends on a lot of factor that could change in such a long time . however , and given the news that we are facing all day , i think is possible having an accurate idea about what the future will be , and in this future will be fewer car . at first , looking back to the past , we can see that the development of car manufacturing wa linked to some social and economic factor . in the very beggining of car industry , a car wa considered a luxurious device for most of the population , but thanks to henry ford , the private automobile became a popular consume good , formerly in the united states and later in europe . in it heyday in the fifty , the american car were a symbol of power and wealth in all the country of the world . nevertheless , the environmental condition have changed widely in the last decade . the continuous rising of the gas price , linked to the political unstability of the leading productors ; the rising of the consciousness that the planet resource are limited , and the fact that the natural environment is being harmed , have changed the attitude towards the private car . indeed , the urban life ha been severely disturbed by the wide use of car . the possibility of using the car to conmmute everyday ha created the sprawl phenomenon , with the bitter consequence of decaying inner city , collapsed highway , destruction of farmland , pollution , and lack of social contact in the car-oriented suburb . therefore , i think that the use of the car will be reduced in the future . it is necesary that all the society face the environmental and social problem that car are creating . of course i think that car are useful and i drive , however , i think that car should be used in a more smart way than today . combinig the car with efficient public transportation network , we will create a different and most sustainable pattern of urban growing .
