i strongly agree that successful people try new thing and risk than only doing what they already know how to do well . first , i have seen successful many people so far in my field which is civil engineering . most of them are professor or reseachers . they only studied their detail major during master and ph . d course so they could be specialist in their field . however , after being specialist , they do to research about another detail field because they feel that they ca n't survival if they do only reseach their own field . for example , my academic advisor professor cho , who wa studying traffic engineering in the ph . d course , is famous professor regarding concrete pavement in korea . he did n't know well about concrete pavement . the reason why he did reseach on concrete pavement is that he find out the relationship between the traffic volum and the feature of material of the pavement . now he is the best specialist because he ha been trying new thing . on the other hand , some professor or researcher intent to easy go . they only research about their detail field so they ca n't develop and success . i think , all those thing considered , people continusely try to develop new thing for success .
