the probleme of the number of car throughout the world is often debated when talking about polution . even if personal car are not the main factor of air pollution ( factory for instance pollute more than car ) they are often heavily accused of polluting because they give an example of individual pollution that could be easily reduced by reducing the number of car . i however really do not think that there will be fewer car in twenty year than today a the world population keep growing from decade to decade . i do not know exactly how many human there we will be in twenty year but i have heard it would be around 7 milliard . for a demographic reason , even if poverty doe not decrease in the thrid world , there will be more western people and consequently more car . so we can ask ourselves the question how the number of car could possibly decrease . it is effectively noticable that car become cheeper and cheeper . consequently , the number of poor people who will be able to aford a car will increase and i really do not think they will refuse this privilege if they get it . mathematically , the number of car may exponentially grow . this growth tendency might be reduced if the different governements and non governemental organisation try and work together to control that expansion . the trouble being that they are barely able to find an agreement on other purpouses such a factory air pollution and water spoiling and chemical pollution so i do not think that they will consider car like a priority . furthermore , i don4t see the resaon why it should be placed a priority because when you see the amount of drinkable water decreasing in coutries like bangladesh for instance , i really think there is still to be done before prohibiting car
