i agree with this statement . i think it is really important to understand idea and concept because thus you can open your mind and you can be more aware . learning fact and do not understand them is unuseful at all . everybody could learn and learn and do not understand a thing . where the interest is ? you should understand first , like that you could have an idea about the subject and you could have an opinion , your own opinion . just learn is not useful in daily life , you can talk about that you just learned because you still remember but you can not really discus about it because you did not understand the main idea or the concept . however you should learn thing that you are be able to understand to remember it in the future . to understand an idea or a concept help you to remind it . to conclude both of understanding and learning are important , but you should understand first before to learn , after that you are going to be able to learn without difficulty it will be easier for you .
