broad knowledge of many academic subject is interesting in order to get a general view on subject . one is then able to get involved in different matter . the more general view you will have have , the more you will be able to understand other people isssues and what they are concerned of . but by having a view on many subject , you will not be able to masterise them . specializing in one specific subject will allow you to emphasis the subject and develop high quality skill . it then depends what you research . if you know exactly what you want to be doing or that you work on high technicity subject you will then need to get specialised . if you want to keep an evolution possibility in the subject you are studying or if you absolutly need a global view on your topic you will then need to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . from my point of view , it is necessary to develop a high level of skill . it is to say specialise even if you have to choose between subject that seem all interesting and challenging . studying geography , math , physic , litterature or history will require a high level of knowledge and investment that will not allow you to get on several subject . ideally , on a five year academic course , a possible option would be to perform a double study class . at the end you will then be specialized in two complementary subject such a science and management , geography and economics , business and information technology .
