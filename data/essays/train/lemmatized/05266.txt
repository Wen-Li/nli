it is debatable that teenager , these day , put the time to help their communities. a rapidly growing number of people think that young people also help thier community because they are belonged to a wide range of group and those group participate in helping community . in contrast , i strongly believe that student do not spend their time to helping their community because they not only focus on more difficult exam , but also tend to become selficient . first of all , these day , a lot of difficult exam or test make student spend more time . young people study hard to enter more prestigious university . thus they focus on studying rather than helping their community . according to reserch of chosun-ilbo , one of the leading newspaper in korea , a number of student who give the seat to the elder or visit the orpanage or silver house . the reserch demonstates that 70 % student respond that they do not have enough time to think about other thing , instead of studying . on top of that , teenager do not think other people whether they are poor or not . they have tendency of selfcient . in the past , many student consider their community when community have special party or festival for reconition of community , so they frequently help install tool or stage . the best example of this is that my father help making stage of the rural festival of harvesting . he said that at that time , most student who lived in thier community gave the their hand in order to succeed the festival . on the other hand , when our community have beach festival every summer , even though our community ask help assistance , no student emerged the cite to install stage , hence the festival failed . in this respect , at present , student are selficient compared to the past . in conclusion , young people do not spend enough time to giving thier hand for community . the reason are the stuends concentrate studying more to enter the better university , and teenager are more selficient that the past . all in all , a substantial nmber of student study at home , even though the our community want to need the assistant of teeanagers .
