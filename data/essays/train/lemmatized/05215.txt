i think it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in fact if a person know concept that are on the basis of every fact or situation , he can solve all these problem that are connected with those idea , on the other hand , if he know only the fact without havig the concept and the idea on the basis , he can solve only that problem and situation which are similar to that . all this is very important in many aspect or situation in our life because everyday we have in front of u some different problem that we can solve only if we know the concept and the idea . especially we find these problem in our work , in our office , in our classroom , in our homework , so in the our environmental work . for example one person can solve a problem easier and faster than other people because he ha the concept and the idea on the basis of that work while other people know only the fact and , if a situation introduce a new solution or a new detail , they do n't arrive to solve the problem , they do n't understand the new situation and so they ca n't arrive to the solution and to the implementation of the situation . a person who know concept and idea can solve all the problem that a situation or a detail can introduce and he can develop new solution and new implementation about the problem . finally i think that a person who know only fact he know only a little part of his work because he can solve only a schematical problemsv while a person that ha many idea and concept he know more thing of his work and so he can solve all situation of a problem with new detail and aspect and he can also find new and better solution .
