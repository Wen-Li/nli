i completely agree . that is the purpose of an advertisement , to try to make thing look better than they really are . our society is based in capitalism and consumism . the more you make people buy thing ( even the one they do not need or work a they should ) , more money is made and company are able to grow and expand . if a company selling a specific product want to be profitable and expand , it need to let everyone know that it product is the best . now , if you are trying to sell a product but you just realized it ha some flaw , would you tell the custommer about that ? most people would n't . it would imply to invest more money trying to make the product better and capitalism is about making money not expending it . after all , if a company can make money selling quality product they will do it . in advertisement , marketing people look at the good point of a product and focus on them , making them look like the best option for the consummer . obviously , they wo n't say anything about it disadvantage or problem they will try to make people want to buy that product . however , that 's why some country have aggencies to keep track of custommer complainings made about bad product . if they find there 's a problem with the product they might contact the company responsible for that and make it fix it or do something else in order to compensate the custommer expense . i think the important point here is the ethic of the company trying to sell product . if the company only care about making more money , they will try to sell low quality product , however if they have good ethic , they 'll try to sell always the best product even if they need to expend more money
