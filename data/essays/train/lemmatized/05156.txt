there are different way for people traveling . travel is in a group led by a tour guide is one of way , which advantage are more convenient and more cheap , people can do not every thing , just follow in the group led by a tourguide , but disadvantage is on free no choice , people can not play and travel which they want . so i am not agree with the following statement that is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i think people traveling for relaxs and make self happy . people work long time want to travel , maybe with friend or boyfriend or girlfriend , i think they want have space of self , want have free or choice of self . like me , when in my holiday , i want travel with my boy friend , i want have space of u , i want have a remantic traveling , however , if we are traveling in a group led by a tour guide , will ha another people in my space . i think we will nit happy . and some traveler like traveling by self and travel to alot of place or country , but some time tour guide don not have the group which the traveler ' want , so will make the traveler spend long time in check in the group for travelling . traveler will mistake good chance and time to the place or country where they most want to go . hence , from above i statement , travel is in a group led by a tour guide is a good a way , but not best way , sometime people can choice the way according the need and like . thus i think trave is in a group led by tour guide is not best way .
