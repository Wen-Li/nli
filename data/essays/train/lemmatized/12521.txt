i agree with this sttement . most advertisement on magazine and tv are really atractive . every time i see them , they say to me '' i am tasty '' or '' you will look better if you wear this '' . it is dificult for me to stop buy them . for example , when i bouhgt a food which i had seen an advertisement on tv or magazine before , i usually think '' this is different from an advertisement . they did not say tyuth ! '' a real food is usually smaller . also the taste of it is not good . many cooky in advertizement are made fresh and savory and crispy . not only food but also cloth , i offten disappoint the real cloth at a department store . when i try them and look at a millar , i think `` this is not one which i saw on the magazine ! '' it is true that every cloth look very fine and gramarous when super model wear them . and such a advertisement make me think that i look thin and have faburous style if i will wear them . some electlicity such a tvs and personal computer and cell phone in advertizement are different too . many of them are complicate and diffifult to use actually . but an older man in tv advertizement us a cell phone without memo or a woman us microwave with only an index finger . after she prssing a bottun , she do only waiting . it is very useful and helpful .
