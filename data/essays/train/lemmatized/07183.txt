most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . many compnies adveritise in order to make lot of money . their purpose is to make money and their purpose is to make the company 's image good on the consumer . first of all , when i bought the shampoo that wa advertised on television seemed so good . they did show how the hair wa shining after they washed their hair . thereby , i went to the store and bought one of the shampoo that wa advetised . unfortunately , for my hair wa no good . it did not make my hair a shining a i expected . moreover , it made my hair more oily that i had to wash my hair more often . i think it wa because they used a famous actress that it motivated me more to buy the product . for instance , this actress is using this product so let me follow her . in a way , it is like copying . also , i made a mistake which that actress might had hair that wa perfectly fitted with the shampoo . second of all , when they advertise about certain food , it look more delicious on television . what i found out from my friend who work in an advertisement company wa that she told me they put something inside so it show more greasy and more colorish . i did found some food such a frozen food were not that delicious than i had expected . it all had reason for it . maybe the sound might make advertisement much better than the real product . i think there are several factor allow product to look good . first factor wa they use an famous actor or actress so people want to use it . it is more like copying or it is more like this actor is using it so i better use it . second factor are sound and background . when people advertise they do add some sound or ingredient so it seems that product look good itself but it is not . it is the surroundings that make the product good itself .
