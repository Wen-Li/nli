`` youth is blunder , manhood is struggle , oldage an regent '' this quatation do realy set out view towards essay . i think older people can enjoy their life more then the young one . for me age doesnt matter much when it come to the enjoyment of life . each thing that young man can do , so can old man too . the following essay will clear out my point of view firstly , the experience the old person have , for me the experience is the mother of wisdom , so if your more wise more easily you can overcome the hindrance in your life . old people are more aware of the outcome of the life , the phase of their life which they have beenpass through . yes i do agree that young person do have more agility , fitness then old man do , but if an old person have kept hin fit by various exercise then he can also be like current youth secondly , the way you consider the enjoyment . if the young person thing the enjoyment in life is going to pub , disco , then way could not the oldperson can go towards this place . what majorly differ in young an old preson is their age limit and age effecting their ability , but i do not think age can be related to the enjoyment . old person do enjoy their life by their own way a way which would never lead to no dilemma occur in their life . each step of the old person in the life would be an well calculated , well organized one lastly , `` old is better than gold '' and realy for me the gold is an ejoyment in the sense that money value of the gold , for me money is the main source of enjoyment and old is better then gold then way not the oldperson can enjoy more life then the young youth do .
