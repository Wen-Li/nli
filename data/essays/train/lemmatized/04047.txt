i really agree with this statement . i am sure that one day there will have fewer car than today or that these car will be different than today . cars produce so much pollution and cause dammages to our environment . the problem is that everyone use his own car to go working , go to school , or other activity . it could be so much better if people use one car for four person . at firts the pollution will be reduce and also that is cheaper to share the cost of transport between four person . an other way to reduce the number of car is to not use it too often and use it only for long travel , if it is possible use a little moto or bycicle for short travel . take the bus or the train can be an other good alternative to the car , but in this case the govrnment must give more money to these public transport for allow them to reduce the price of a ticket . futhermore , having more tax on the oil , tax of circulation , and give a reduction to worker who use public transport can influence behaviour . there will be fewer car , but i think also that they will be differents than today . we must look for others oil , more respectfull of nature . as an exemple we can not the sun ( but the problem is that in every country the sun is not shining all the day and more , not every day ) , the wind but it is the same problem , it 's depend too much of the climatics condition . today there are some hybride car , that 's show the a beginning of a changement but not the end . if we want to save our world , everyone must do something , it is a socitie problem . more car , will reduce the problem of pollution and heathl .
