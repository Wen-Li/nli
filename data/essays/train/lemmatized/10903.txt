it is often said that these day , youth do not allocate enough time to helping other people . i highly support this idea because today 's society more weighs another value , such a personal skill and ability to win the brutally competition and youth also are more individualistic than the past . first of all , contemporary society prefers competitive warrior to warm-hearted ordinary people . in other word , people in modern society must win their enemy in thier field to succeed . there is no place for humanism such a helping others in this situation . for example , when i wa a university student , volunteer work in agricultural town still were popular . however , nowadays that volunteer program are abolished because most of the student do n't apply . these day , a large number of student are very busy to prepare exam such a english fluency test or computer ability test . that 's because that exam are helpful for their future career and job recruiting . moreover , nowadays , young people are more affected by individualism . they more weigh benefit of them than value of whole society . for instance , 1980 's korean university student council were dominated by people who affected by socialism and communism . however , 2000 's korean university student do n't interested that value . they more concentrated their own ability and entertainment . as shown above , these day , youth do n't invest their time for their community . that 's because sociey ha changed and people themselves are also changed .
