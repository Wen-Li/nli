in my opinion it is not true that young people enjoy life more than older people - for various reason . one of the most important reason for me is that it is impossible to generalize . every individual is different . a shy , introverted young person may find it hard to enjoy life and a lot of teenager today have a tendency to spend a lot of time inside the house watching tv or playing computer-games rather than to go out and socialize with people their age . a lot of them seem to prefer living in a virtual world rather than reality . on the other hand i have noticed that older people can be very communicative and chatty , they still know the importance of socializing , making new friend , getting to know their neighbour and they enjoy having a social network around them - family friend and neighbour . a lot of young people do go out - but do they enjoy life ? it always is a question of definition , is n't it ? especially in the u.k. there is the phenomenon of binge drinking - mostly young people who try to get completely drunk a quickly a possible . the effect can be seen in the street of a lot of city on a saturday night . in a lot of club teenager go to you can get a wide range of drug . if that is your idea of enjoying life - have fun ! and then , old people today might not be what they used to be - i think the elder generation ha become a lot more active ( and more often than not ha a secure income at it disposal ) . old people now like to go on holiday , they might even buy their villa in spain , there is a whole wellness-industry aimed at the older generation . so , in the end wether you enjoy life or not really is not a question of age but of attitude .
