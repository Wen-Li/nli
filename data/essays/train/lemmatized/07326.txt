that is a really good question because today , the academic system permit the choice between a broad knowledge of many academic subject and specilization in one specific subject . the choice can be depend on the future of the person who have to do this choice . in fact , according the job who decide to do , it is better to do one choice or the other one choice . for example , when you decide to become a lawyer , the best choice is to specialize in one specific subject because it is a really specialize job and it is difficult to something else in the same time . so a really good knowledge is necessary for doing this job . but if you decide to become a manager , this is different . in fact , you must to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . for doing this job , you must be good in many subject like the management , the marketing , the relationship , the comptability or the law . .. that is why , having broad knowledge of many academic subject is really necessary . so , if i have the choice , i agree with it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . but , i think that it is important for several job that the knowledge is really specialize because it is impossible to know everything and it is more safe to concentrate his knowledge on only one subject . so , like i said in the introducing , the choice must be depend on the job what would like to do .
