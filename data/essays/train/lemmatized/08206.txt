young and old people have different way of living . yet they both enjoy life . on the first hand i will see why it is often said that young people enjoy life more than older people . on the other hand i will show that the statement is not always true . first , young people are more ealthy and it easier for them to have a lot of activity . for example , student are more likely to hang out at night and wake up early in the morning . yet , it is their way of enjoying life . then , student life such a living on campus help partying , having meeting and doing sport . young people enjoy life more than olders because they are always discovering thing for example they learn new thing every day in class . finally , young people are not a conscious of the danger a older people and so they just live without taking care of the trouble they may meet . for an example we always say that child are innocent because they just live their life by playing , eating and sleeping . we could go a far a to say that they enjoy more life because they have le trouble than older people who still enjoy life but differently . first , we must bear in mind that enjoying life is an important part of our intellecutal development and that we need to be happy in order to live well . older people have different activity , they may prefer staying at home reading a book instead of hanging out with friend . that do not mean that they enjoy life le than young people . then , if older people seem to be more calm amd to enjoy le life than young people it is probably because they have already been young , and everything youth are doing now they have done it a long time ago ! actually , adult who have to take care of a familly may have le time to enjoy their life in the same way that they did before but that doe not mean that they do not enjoy life , because familly life for them may be more enjoyable than student life . to conclude , a far a i am concerned i would say that people enjoy their life differently wether they are young or old but they still enjoy their life . to my mind only a person is able to say if he is enjoying is life or not , and it is difficult to compare because it depends on everyones taste .
