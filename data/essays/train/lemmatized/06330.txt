it is a very common idea that there are two different way of what can be called ` learning ' , for a student in a school . the first way is to learn about a subject by understanding how it work and the concept that are below it . the other way is more mecanical and implies learning fact about this subject . i agree with the statement , that is i think that in most situation , when one ha to choose , he had better to understand the idea and concept than just learn fact . there are lot of argument in favor of it . first , in most situation the fact are not repeatable . for example in scientific issue , the basic interest of general rule and equation is that they can be transposed and used in the most possible context . and to use these equation , one ha to understand them . learning fact in a scientific field , like for example the resulting speed of an object , doe not give any clue about the result of an experiment in another context . secondly , the process of learning is also important . learning fact stimulates only memory and doe not give a very secured way of learning . on the contrary , by trying to understand concept and idea , a student stimulates other part of his mind , start of process of real thinking . that kind of process is more likely to be memorized and to be useful to the student , a it is an active way of learning . third , a student should not only care about immediate issue such a having a good mark at an exam . indeed university and school should be a place where student can develop their skill , their ability of thinking , analysing situation , etc . eventhough focusing more on understanding than on learning fact can be le efficient in the short time , it should be more efficient in the long term . in addition it is also very useful in life to know how to analyse situation and understand them . yet there are naturally exeptions . and the statement may not be true in every situation . for example , history or geographic study require mainly to learn fact and it is this learning which determines the level , the skill of someone in that field . let u say that even though learning fact is sometimes very important , there is always the need to be able to use them , and to understand a specific situation .
