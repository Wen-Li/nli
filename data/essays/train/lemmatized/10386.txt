the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' is very true in my opininion . first , if this sentence is taken and placed in a political context , many example appear that illustrate the truthfulness of the sentence . for example , the late president sadat of egypt introduced a new economic program to the country called `` infitah '' in arabic and which mean `` to be open '' in english . this program wa new to the country because it involved open trade with any country in the world , unlike the old system which wa a socialist or a closed trade system . that system had many critic at the time it wa adopted but sadat took the risk and implemented the program which turned to be a great economic success for the country . second , the statement is true when looking at it from a business point of view . for example , bill gates , the owner of microsoft , tried a lot of new thing and invented a lot of software that turned out to be very successful although there were great risk for it failure at the begininning . moreover , the word `` innovation '' is used by many business nowadays to illustrate thier belief in new thing and anything new must have great risk at first . major company have entire department directed for research and development , also called `` r & d , '' and they spend huge amount of money to fund these department . therefore , the business enviroment belief that new thing lead the way for profit and thus success . in conclusion , i totally agree with the statement because it could be applied in any context and found to be true . being innovative in any aspect , whether in politics , economics , or business , will deffinetly lead to success but with great risk involved .
