people have different opinion about whether they should travel in a group led by a tour guide or not . in my opinion , i strongly support the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because of several reason . first of all , a tour guide know where is the most wonderfull palces . people do not want to spend their money and time by going to unexcited palces and they want to see somthing they have never seen in their life . last year i went to canada and i did not know about niagra fall , but when i joined a group ha a tour guide he took u their and that wa one of the best place i have ever seen in my life because i did not know about that before . another reason to support the idea for having a tour guide is that usually a guide know the best way to go to the palces that we need . we could save time insead of using map or gps and wasting time and our vacation looking for the direction or asking people in the street how to go home back . my father went to new york and he could not find 5th ave. and he spent all the day looking for it in the map . finally , when we have a tour guide usually we will go by the same can or in a big bus so we do not need to spend money to rent a car . i went with my wife and we both were happy because we did not worry about having a car which will cost u alot of money . to sum up , this reason that i cited are about traveling in a group led by a tour guide when we travel insead of traveling alone . if we talvel in a group ha a tour guide we will enjoy the trip and spend most of the time by going to place we did not know about it and in the same time we could save
