an education system should be capable of giving to the student all the element in order to be a better person and professional . obviusly , understanding idea and concept is very important for the student for learnig and analize thing , but i think that is not enough . students should have all the element in order to resolve problem and face conflict in the future . learning specific fact , like history fact or gramar fact , is important , but is not the only way to get a complete education . the specific fact , student learn them for the exam and forget next day , but if the teacher teach them how to connect idea , how to understand concept , how to make a connection between this with that , student will have the element to be a sucesfull people . an student can know everything about history or math or maybe chemistry , buy if he ca n't make a logical conexion between fact and idea , it doe n't make any sense . when student have to face on working expirience , they wo n't need specifical fact that they learn in school , they will need the capacity of conecting idea and understanding concept . the last sentence doe n't mean that fact , a date or formula or specific thing , student doe n't need them in working life , probably will probably wo n't , but i think that understanding idea and concept is more valuable for a company when they want a good employer . students need an education that provides them a lot of element to resolve problem , create idea , connect concept and anything can help them to be a person who can face any problem or situation succesfully .
