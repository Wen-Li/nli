i agree with the above statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' .why mean ? the reason are a follows . now itself the fuel price ha been come to the peak value and moreover in the future traffic might increase and every get risk of using the car and they get wexed of the traffic . and the government might increase the tax for the usage of car due to the main cause for the traffic . and not only that in the future we may get fuel crisis i.e . we may not get a fuel for the car i.e. petrol to run the car . and another thing is that people may get very le leisure time to use car . and only the fewer people us the car like government official , and big landlord , businessmen and the people who were much use of it only can use . these factor lead to the usage of le car in the coming twenty year .
