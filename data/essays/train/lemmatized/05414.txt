in general i think that both understanding conceps and learn fact are the two face of the same medal . i try to explain here below all the connection between concept and fact especially in science metters . all the big science discovery depends on the observation of fact , but on the other side is important to know all the theory related to this observation to give a coherent and logical explanation of fact we are observing . to give an order to this matter i think that first ( in a temporary order , not for it importance ) student need to learn the instrument they must use to observe fact , so in the first part of student formation is necessary for them to learm a much a possible about all theory and idea which are the core of the metter and after they can understand and remember much more easely all fact connected with their study . for example if you are studying the atomic structure , of course you need to know everithing about the chemistry and related theory . this example feat quite well to this assey especially if we think about the discovery of nuclear fission . it happened that the woman , who wa of course a phisycs and have studied a lot of theory , wa observing the fact about accelerated neutron pushed against the nuclear part of a not stable atom . during the observation of the fact , she expected that , using enough energy , the neutron would link with the atom , instead it heppens that the atom divided producing a large quantity of energy , and thanks to her previous study she understand she had discovered the nuclear energy and atomic fission . in last analisys , i can say that the deepest concept knowledge would be unuseful if it would n't be used to learn how all these theory are connected with fact , and at the same time it would be unuseful if we know a lot of fact but without knowing how these fact liks together .
