learning fact ha no meaning if it is not supported by the capability of understanding idea and concept . therefore i would say that i agree with the statement . whenever you are learning a `` fact '' , you are learning something which ha already been stated . what is most important about fact are the idea and the concept that brought to that fact . for example , talking about history , it is easy to learn so many fact about the french revolution that whenever someone will question you , you will be able to answer with date , bottle , name etc but if you do not understand the historical background you wo n't be able to understand how much the idea and concept developing at that time influenced the beginning of the french revolution . another example could be better set by phylosophy , phylosophy is such a complex matter that just knowing the fact mean nothing . what make philosophy so interesting is the flow of idea and concept that we are still using everyday . we are not using fact . even when talking about political problem , for example , we can not only report the fact we have to support the fact with the idea and concept that created those fact . it doe not matter the course someone is attending , the key point is to understand the idea and concept and then it will be easier to remember and talking about fact .
