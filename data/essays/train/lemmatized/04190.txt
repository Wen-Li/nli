although many people believe that young people enjoy life more than older pepole do , i disagree with this statement . in the following , i will give three argument for having this opinion . first of all , i want to mention that many older people are retired . that mean that they can organize their pastime a they like to . they are able to do a lot of activity for which they probably did n't have enough time while working . usually , many older people spend their time travelling around the world , learning a new language or an instrument , or are just relaxing . my grandmother , for instance , enjoys her life in the summer by going to a lake every day . she love to be in the nature , to watch the bird and to swim in the lake . another point is that many older people already made a lot of experience in their life . they will probably not have the feeling like younger people do that they could miss something in daily life . they are surrounded by kind of a quiet mood and can totally concentrate on enjoying life . younger people , by contrast , always feel the pressure and stress that should become successful to be able to enjoy their life later on . the pressure might be caused by the expectation of the educational system or by the comparison to the older people , often parent or grand-parents , who were already successful in the past . finally , older people are often happy abouth small thing in life . they often do n't need a lot of material comfort . they rather appreciate that they can still walk around , that they are of good health or that they have a family they can talk to . my grand-parents , for example , do n't have a car . thus , they do n't have to worry about higher gas price . in conclusion , i want to stress that older people are definitely able to enjoy life the same a younger people do . they just do it in another way which might be hard for younger people to accept .
