i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept it is for them to learn fact . it usually for the student to know how they make a good life and understanting the fact . not only for the student but also in every peson in this life . learning fact is how to make your mind open . there is many reason for my agreement , it make the student have more understanding for anything , and to keep the idea in his head . any student must make concept the idea for him to understant the idea exactly . if he concept the idea and he understand it very well , he would not forget it any more , and he will learn the fact by this way . for very simple example , if the student take in the school that if he will not wash his hand before the meal , he would have a stomech aeche , so he will do it any more . not only for the student but also for any pearson , even child or adult peaple . in their job or in their house they should concept evrything for them self to know it correctally or exactly . anybody should konw the fact for everything to make them mind open , therefore , it make them very understanding person to talk with them . in conclusion , understanding idea and concept it for them is very good idea to know the fact exactly . knowing the fact is some thing very important to be an open mind person .
