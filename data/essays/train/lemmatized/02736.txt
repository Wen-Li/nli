i completely agree with the statement : even though fact are important , i think it is more important for student to understand idea and concept . in fact , sometimes idea and concept are behind a fact , they are the main cause of them : understanding them is the best way to have a real comprehension of the fact . i will show two example that can support my opinion . in a scientific theory , for example the theory of gravity , i think that the most important thing to know is the main concept of the theory : an object is attracted by the center of the earth , because everything in the universe ha a force of attraction because of it mass . this is the concept , the basic idea of the theory : understanding it it 's more important than studying the formula . once i have understood this concept , i can study the fact : the formula of the earth 's gravity , how scientist discovered this theory , what experiment were made in order to demonstrate it et cetera . .. in the same way , i think that is more important to understand idea and concept also in other subject . for instance , it could be really important in history . for example , when someone ha to study the period of the fascism , in italy and in europe in general , i think that a good comprehension of the fact should focus on the society in these year , on the economical condition of these country after the i world war , on what people though after a terrible event that happened in europe before . facts , date , event , are important , but in my opinion come in a second time . if a student doe not understand that fascism can occur when a man with a big personality ha the power where there is a particular , social and economical situation in a country , he will not understand the main cause of the event . on the other hand , if he understand it , he could understand the cause of fascism and why some european country have had a dictatorship after the world war i . in conclusion , i think that idea and concept are fundamental in order to understand the cause of something , then fact derives from these cause .
