according to this topic i can neither agree nor disagree . on the one hand young people have a lot of energy for instance they can dance through the whole night or go in for every kind of sport they like . regularly they do not have physical problem and they know that they have lot of life-time . but on the other hand they are often struggeling with themselves . first love , future and a lack of experience etc. are difficulty in their life . personally i am often so worried about my future , my job perspective and so on that i can not sleep in the evening . older people are more experienced . although they have got problem , too , they mostly take them easier . they know life go on . that is why they see the thing differently and can enjoy other thing than younger people . after year of good and bad time they can analyze situation in another way . if your are young you want to change the world , you are thinking about the big thing . when you are getting older your value change . my mother is a good evidence for this . she told me that went on party a she wa younger and that this wa her way of enjoying life . but today she enjoys staying at home with the family , she enjoys cooking and playing with my little cousin . maybe older people think more positive about life and to my mind that is a sign for life quality . maybe older and younger people have just another way of enjoying life , but neither younger nor older people enjoy life more like the other group . so personally i feel that it is impossible to decide wheather young or old people enyoy life more . especially the fact that i am young make it impossible . so i have to become older and maybe then i will be able to answer this question in a better way .
