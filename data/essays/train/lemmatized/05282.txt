many people tavel by a group led by a tour guide today . i have trveled both with the guide and by myself . when you travel alone , you will be able to do thing that you would like to do . however , i think it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide . when you travel in a group led by a tour guide , they give you a lot of information about that country . you will get to know abot the historical event that happened , and learn the thing that you did not know by listening to the tour guide . for example , when i wa in elementary school , i went to france . we had a tour guide . since he explained thing really detailed and humorusly , i listened to him carefully and i got to know a lot of detail of france after the tour . next , you do not have to care about where to go for restaurant and if you will get lost while traveling . when you tour with a tour guide , they will lead you to the one of the nice restaurant and where to go . if you travel alone you might get lodt often , since it is the place you have never been before . finally , the tour guide will probably know the langage of the country they are guiding . if you do not know the language of the country you are visiting , you will have hard time talking to people . but , when you travel in a tour group , you do n't need to have hard time making conversation to people , sonce the tour guide translate thing to you . to conclude , i think it is much better to travel in a group led by a tour guide because you can get a lot of useful information , you do n't have to care about where to go or fetting lost and you do n't have to concern about the language .
