in response to the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , i agree . successful people ha a vision and ha the ability to transform it into reality . take for example the czech immigrant nikolo tesla . he wa a brilliant scientist who invented the induction generator which generated alternating current . this wa at a time when the authority on power and transmission of power wa thomas alva edison who had invented direct current . tesla wa able to show that transmission loss in alternating current over large distance were negligible a opposed to tremendous loss in direct current which made transmission of direct current for distance greater than two mile , virtually impossible . tesla had a vision of an induction generator generating alternating current which by virtue of it property would suffer little attenuation during transmission . he also had the expertise and knowledge to invent one . this gave him success which he richly deserved . successful people are also be able to take a calculated risk in trying new thing . after all , nothing ventured , nothing gained . a case in point is , mr westinghouse . in an era where edison 's word wa gospel , he chose to back a minnow by the name of nikolo tesla because he could visualise the profit that could be accrued if the concept of alternating current were a success . he invested in a 66 mega watt power generation project for alternating current based on tesla 's design , which changed the way mankind used domestic and industrial electric power , forever . westinghouse is now synonymous with power generation now . this could happen only because westinghouse believed in tesla 's concept and though it wa not proved at that time , risked a major investment in the venture and wa willing to gamble on the success of the project . however , it must be said about the most prolific inventor of our time , thomas alva edison , that for every invention of his which worked there were seven which would not . he did not give up . he persevered and continued with his passion which made him a successful man . preseverence is also a major virtue in successful people .
