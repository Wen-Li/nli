people do thing by differents way . succeful one try new thing and take risk instead of using way they already know . i agree with this statement for many reason . successful people used to find out new way of doing well even if they already know others successsful road . it is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of them . because they want proov them and people than they merited their ttle of successful people . so they take more and more risk to increase , if they succeed their fame . in addition when you are a person who succeed , you have to continue but not to be contented of what you already are . because ther is a hioghly degree of fighting spirit . for example , a very successful company of cell communication , which is faced to a new one whose price are more availabable than hers must take risk by cutting down her price in order to have more profit . it is a new popularity and money entrance . all the same , even if having experience and use it is important , test new method is also good , because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their ability by trying more idea . so there a popular short word : if do not risk , you wil have nothing . successful people are know a person who are couragious , fighting , and humble . because of all these previewing reason successful usually try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . from my point of view it is right . being more successful are important for successful people and they used to choose this way . it is a paradix but it also law of the nature . but some people only do that . everybody ha choice .
