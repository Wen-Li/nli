with the increasing of instant communication , advertisement have become much popular . and nowadays most of the advert are shown by tvs . these advertisement includes from very useful product to the product that cause regretfull day for customer . there are so many situation we are encountering today . how many of u rushed to a market to buy a very simple product that pulled u like a magnet ? it can be a pen or a hi-fi . it doe n't matter . but there are many other product that do the same job like the adverted material . and also , they can be much cheaper than the adverted one . but it doe n't matter . once we are hypnotised with the advertisement on a tv channel , no one can make u buy the other crappy thing , or it seems like a crappy thing . so many feedback are made by the customer till today about lot of unsatisfactory thing . and what is more ; these can be a material that wa being advertised over medium . i also encountered such problem . once i brought back a bad book that became very interesting for me with an advertisement before i bought it over internet . this wa becouse of that shinny advertisement . if i had see the book in a store before , i would even never touch it cover with my precious finger . it wa just a game played over those easly effected customer who watch advertisement , like me . also , there are so many movie that we wanted to see them so much and jumped into the cinema saloon and running away with an incredible speed after the credit . even there are lot of people rush to the exit door of the saloon during the movie break and never come back who ca n't resist . but a you think ; these movie had been advertised so successifully before the watcher spent their hard earned money . in conclusion , it is possible to show a product much more better than they really are with an advertisement . as this happens so much , especially nowadays , do n't buy a product or go to a cinema or even reserve a holiday before hearing some comment . dogcan bicakci .
