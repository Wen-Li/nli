when people decide to increase their knowledge , they decide either to do this on one specific subject or the choose to extent their knowledge in different area . in can be argued that in nowadays steady growing and changing industry a broad knowlegde is essential to adapt to the ever changing market . i am also a proponent of a broad knowledge of m academic subject . firstly , business is changing at a rapid pace . numerous job that have been there for year , and have given labour to people are beeing subsecidiced by machine . for instance , if a worker only know how to do a task that can now be done by a machine , the worker would probably loose his work , due to the fact that for most company machienes are more efficient . what other job could he apply for if he only had the knowledge needed for one kind of labour . replacement of human labour force for machienes is something which happens frequently nowadays , due to the evolving technology . in fact , many people have reacted to this by extending their academic knowledge . this brings them the advantage , of easily adapting to chanching circumstance in the commercial world and they will le fear change in their profession . secondly , i favor a broad knowledge because it it is le boring . specification can bring along boredom over a long term . for example , if someone ha only one task to rely on , in order to keep him satisfied with his work and knowledge , he might get tired of the routine , ascribed to his work . he could not easily switch into another field , without educating himself all over again . he would might have to attend extra course to learn about a new field of interest . if he had extented his knowledge to different subject in his academic career , he would not need extra course or even a new formation . to conclude , having a broad knowledge is more favourable to nowadazs market , it rapid change and new innovation . furthermore , it is key to keep oneself satisfied in his or her labour life , since routine sometimes is a critical factor for unsatisfaction .
