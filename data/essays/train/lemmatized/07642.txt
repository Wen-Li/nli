i do not agree with the statement . in order to explain this opinion , i will first summarize positive and negative aspect of each life stage , and then draw a conclusion from this evidence . young people have several opportunity in their current life stage . the have health and the vigor that characterizes youth . they also have access to opportunity in almost every aspect of life : academic , profession , family , spirituality , etc . they also have support from family member , friend , and colleague . even though youth have these advantage , they have important threat to their possibility of enyoing life . youths worry about their future , planning their carreer , their family , their job , etc . they are also immature to appreciate the special gifs of life , and because of their opportunity , take life for granted . finally , they learn through experience , and sometimes these experience are painful and have terrible consequence . the elderly , on the other hand , are mature , with a broad baggage of lived experience . they can enjoy the fruit of their work and the result of their decision . since they do not have much more to live , they do not take life for granted , and try to enjoy life a much a possible . although the elderly have other threat such a sickness , death in their family and worry of when they are going to die themselves , they have the awareness that their life is short , and they will try to make the most of it . when comparing the youth ' opportunity and threat to those of the elderly , we can easily find that the advantage of the elderly , in term of possibility of enjoying life , are greater . in summary , young people worry about their future and do not have the time to enjoy their present , whereas the elderly enjoy their present and accept their future .
