many people say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i definately agree with that . that the statement is true , could easily be shown by any cientific research comparing what young people in general do now and what they used to do in earlier generation . in my opinion different reason let to this . one reason is , that , compared to the past , people live in a more individualistic way . most people grow up in a small family , often not even with both but only one parent , and family tie become le and le strong . while in the old day there where always uncle and grandparent etc. to play an important role in the upbringing of a child , nowadays often there is no relationship at all because being a family member is not enough of a reason to keep in contact . this ha an important impact on a child development . if you shouldnt even care about your family , why should you care about your community ! this change of the way how people grow up came along with a shift of value . for our parent generation for example it wa normal and looked upon a very positiv for child to help their mother with the cooking , to look after their younger brother and sister , to visit and spend time with their grandparent . nowadays , these action are just not rated very highly . if a child exeeds at sport , is very smart , very beautiful or anything else related to it a a single human being , in society this count much more then just being nice and helpful . it is all about being successful yourself and not about how you interact with others . so it is no wonder that young people tend to put their own interest first before they consider anyone el interest ! it is only logical that child or young adult choose to do thing that others will find attractive and important .
