i agree with the idea that youn people enjoy life more than older do . as one of the young people , i think it is true . i think enjoying life mean enjoy doing thing they like to do . in term of it , younger people have advantage when it come to enjoy thing because of number of opportunity and physical ability . first of all , young people have more oportunities and much time to do thing . since they are young , they have more year till their death if here we just think of average life span . they can do whatever they want to try and they can try it again if they like it and never have to do it if they hate it . older people need to think about what they can do during rest of their life and it might discourage them to do everything they want to do . knowing that they have limited time left to enjoy , older people might be too nervous to try thing . young people do not care about it , so they can enjoy thing more . second of all , whenever someone doe something , he need to think about his physical ability . for older people , they tend to have more physical problem and deseases than younger people do . for example , my grandparent love to travel around the world but they can not do that anymore in these day because of their body problem . it is very easy for them to be tired and stressed out by going somewhere by plane and by staying hotel in country they do not understand language . also , it is hard to recover from that . in contrast , younger people have stronger body and physical ability that can get over such tire and stress . they can do their favorite thing more often than older people do . in conclusion , i believe that young people make their life more enjoynable than older people do . they have longer time to do thing and stronger physical condition to try thing they like than older do . such unchangenable situation make me sure that young people enjoy .
