i do not completely agree for the following reason : it is said that a man/woman is most productive in their younger year . it the time when they can take the most from this world and give back the most . this may be due to the fact that they are mentally and physically more capable than small child or grownup and also because they are more enthusiastic about life . however , the involvement of the young in their own community ha decreased to quite an extent . they no longer take interest in what is happenning in their community , or for that matter their own family . the main reason are lack of time and concern . people have a busy schedule these day trying to manage their personal and professional life . most people are too occupied making a successfull career that they are unable to find time for their family or the society . for some , their work and personal life have enough problem to even be concerned about their community . young people try and make the best out of their productive year to make a decent living and to plan for their future and the future of their family . however , it is not true for all people . there are still young people who are eager and willing to participate in community life and further develop it . there are young professional who do social work apart from their regular job and try and give back something to the community . emerging young political leader , especially in india , are an example to other young people who are determined in doing community service . others work for their community a they see it a a source of satisfaction . what is needed is motivation and the realisation that one can not survive long being detached from his/her community and that it requires participation and constant improvement . eventually , everybody need the comfort of the society or community once they have grown old and realising this fact would encourage young people to help their community and address the problem that they face .
