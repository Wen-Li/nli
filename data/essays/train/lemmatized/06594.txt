the issue at hand is whether to have a baisc knowledge of many acedemic subject or to speciialize in one subject . in my opinion it is better to specialize in one subject rather than to have basic knowledge of many subject . this is because alot of time and energy will be spent on studying many subject . on the other hand by specializing in one subject a person can have full knowledge of that subject and advance in that field . first reason of my belief to specialize in one subject is that the bounderies of knowlegde is too large for one individual to cover . knowledge is an infinite ocean and is very difficult for an individual to acquire it even the basic of it . while studying one subject will be much easier and useful since then a person can apply his or her knowledge . secondly i think one should specialize in a subject because by studying too many subject the individual might get confused . the individual in the process of learning many subject might not be able to learn even one subject properly which wiil render all his studying useless since his brain will be distracted by too much information . studying one subject will not distract the individual since he will have only one subject to concentrate on . lastly it is better specialize in one spefic subject because studying one subject will make an individual better and better each day in that subject . the person will command an expertize on the subject , which ensures his progress and development . thus for a person to advance and progress in life he or she should specialize in one subject rather than acquiring the knowledge of many subject and end up in learning nothing .
