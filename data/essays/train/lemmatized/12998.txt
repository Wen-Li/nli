to justify whether young people do give enough time to helping their community or not it is important to work out the situation a young woman or man is faced with in our society . it is a significant sign for young people that they seek for independence and try to go their own way . so they do not like to be resposible for somebody and also do not want to be addicted from the society . that could be a reason why the refuse to invest more time into their community . but the major point why young people do this is another one . it reveals to the value and the image that is created especially in our job life . `` you have to be succesful , otherwise you get kicked. '' is a quote many young people are often the ellbow mentality provokes that young people often totally focus on their own career or even do not have the time to deal with the communitie 's task . it is a rough and cold wind that blow in our society and retreating is the younger generation 's way to cope on this developement . being social and caring for somebody else is definetly out at the moment . but this development is quite dangerous for u all and that is why it can not be tolerated any more , otherwise we are just waiting for a bomb to explode . we have to come back to our value and identification a a community . it is important to communicate the greatness of being part of a community , to have friend and not being alone in difficult situation . the gap between rich and poor member is increasing tremendously fast and will even support sepperation from each other . so i think it is especially the task of the younger generation to see this problem and to deal with it . otherwise the globalisation will hurt our society even harder and the problem might cannont be solved anymore . we have the responsibility and the ability to stop this development by trying to do our best and helping the people around .
