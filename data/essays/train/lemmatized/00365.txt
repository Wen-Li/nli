i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . the statement is true . young people nowadays are very busy with their schedule . they do not have time to involve in the activity that help their community . for example , my brother who is working a a software engineer is busy with his job working late night on task assigned to him . so he doesn'thave that much time to engage himself for helping his community . the young people nowadays are lacking the sense of helping . many people are thinking about what they get in return after helping their community . for example , i met a young minister in our locality . he wa very reluctant to help the community people because he think that he doe n't get anything in return from them and it a meagre waste of granting fund to them . although some young people are getting enough time to help others they are simply wasting their time . for example , my cousin who is a teacher , after returning from the school , simply waste the remaining time just by idling or watching t.v . the current generation , particularly student are engrossed in their study and sport rather than making an effort to help others . some people are wasting their money by spending it on waste activity such a drinking , smoking etc . if they spend this money on helping their community it will be very useful for the people . some young people are in the mad race for acquiring land . if they donate these land to the homeless in the community , atleast they can build house and provide shelter for themselves . finally i conclude that helping his own community is the most essential function of young people . they should spare time for helping .
