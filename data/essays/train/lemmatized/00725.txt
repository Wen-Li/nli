the issue at hand is whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic field or to specialize in one subject . this question is not easy to answer , because i am convinced that this question is not able to be answered generally . i believe that there are several point which do not support that knowledge of many subject is the better option and there are several one which do . a disadvantage of having broad knowledge is that this sometimes mean , that you are le familiar with each subject . sometimes in working life it is really important to have a subject you are really good at and not several one you are le good at . if a company is searching for a new translater for english , it doe not help that an applicant is also able to speak french and italian , if the result is that the english skill are only good instead of very good . but i am also quite sure that specializing on only one subject could be disadvantagable , because it is always important to be interested in and to have skill except your specific subject . some job require skill in many different field . teachers are a good example . for being a good english teacher it is not enough to speak english very well . a teacher should also have knowledge about didactics , psychology and pedagogics , because he must be able to teach , to communicate and to handle student in a appropriate way . additionally , there are some skill , called soft skill , everbodz should have and which is more important that acedamic knowledge . being able to work in a team is a good example . it doe not help you to know everything about a knowledge , if you are not able to work in a project group . in conclusion , i am quite certain that a mix of both , specializing in a subject and also having a broad knowledge is the best option .
