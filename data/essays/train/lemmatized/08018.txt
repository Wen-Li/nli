first of all i agree only partially with the statement above , and in particulary i think it ca n't be considered an always valid statment . i think that the problem is very simple : the statement can be considered true if we want to do a generical analysation of the problem . it 's well known that advertisement are done to try to sell a certain product , and so if they are not convincing how can the productor sell them ? a second factor is that in the world we live now , we are completely submersed by product of every type , every form , every colour and every brand , how could we choose one of them without advertisement or explanation of what the product is consisting on ? i have also to admit that sometimes the company of medias exagerate in telling lie , but is in the intelligence of the person who have to buy something to not believe in everything they say , and first of all see the product with their eye , ask for information about it , compare the price and the feature with that of the other product of the other company , and finally buy the object . generally i apply the way of thinking i explained above , but i have to admit that sometimes they captured me in their advertisement ; i will give you an example : some month ago i had to go to london to improve my english language , and when i had to book the flight i checked on internet the different possibility . flight sometimes are very expensive , expecially for a young girl like me and so i remembered i had seen an advertisement on a train in my city of a very low price company of flight . then i found it on internet and booked my flight at a very surprising price ! only 50 euro ! first i wa very happy , but when i arrived at the aireport i had to paid 50 euro more for my luggage and 30 euro more for the overweight of my luggage !!! i wa very very very angry and i decided i wo n't believe anymore in the future in people who promit you something without asking anything !!
