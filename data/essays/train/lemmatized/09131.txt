nowadays there is an average of three car to each family . with the ever evolving technology at hand today , the world ha become much more connected , unlike the olden day , people now need car for may reason such a comuting to work or visiting relative of freinds living far away . there , of cource , are pro and con when it come to disscussing car . cars have increased in nomber these day for many reason . firstly , they are a very comfortable way of travel , whith many having air conditioning , radio and some even have built in t.vs . cars are also very easy to use and can take the driver to any destination he or she desire . currently with the increasing competition between company , car price have fluctuated . these effective vehicle can take you anywhere at any time , unlike train , bus and other public transport system which have difined scheduals and destination . on the other hand car have become a liability to some due to their constant need of maintenence and the large nomber of accident which they cause , for example , you are 20 time more likely to die of a car accident than to die in a plane crash . the increasingly alarming rate of pollution cased by car ha pushed inventor to try and find alternative mean of transport . the constantly increasing price of gas ha led alot of people to abandon their car in search of another , cheaper , mean of transport . i belive that while there are many problem , such a pollution and high oil price , that come with the use of car , they are still the most efficeint mean of travel and while many scientist hope to find alternative to car the chance of that happening in the next twenty year are extremely slim . i personally disagree with the statement , since looking back on previous year you can see that the nomber of car being sold ha only increased and at this rate the nomber of car can only be predicted to contine to grow .
