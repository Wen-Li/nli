i agree the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are two reason for this , physical strength and le responsibility . first , generally youg people have better physical condition than older people . with a time ha past , people become to get aged and the pysical conditon become worth . having strong condition give young people more time . for example , it is possibel for healty young people to get up early in a morning , drive to mountain , enjoy picnic , and have a party after comming back from picnic . physical strengh give young people possible to use their time tightly . same 2 day weekend mean different for those tough youth and tired old people . next , young people tend to have le responsibility in family and society compare with older people . single young people just need to take care of themselves . that mean cost for living is not high , so that they can chose their job by thier own idea . if they do not like the job , they can quit a job and look for another . it is easy for young people to live alone . but for old peple , specially have family , it is totally different . they have a responsiblity to take care of their family . if the one who want to quite a job , it is not easy to decide . they have to finde a job that pay them much enough to take care of their family . in society , more old people have higher position than yong people . those higher position also give high pressure to old people . they have to take care of not only their family but also their staff in their organization . because of those two reason , i agree the idea that young people enjoy thier life more than old people do .
