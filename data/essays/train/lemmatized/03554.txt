i agree with the statement that ` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . ' the present situation of the man demand his time and full energy wherein he is busy all the day with hectic schedule of his work . as the saying , ` man is a social animal ' depicts that , today 's man life in the society , for the society and with the society . so he want to just go along with other people to grab for the oppurtunities for his betterment of need and betterment of his future . if he do not do this for himself , he will definitely lag behind and keep on waiting for the chance to go along with the society . with all these tension in the mind , today 's man is unable to give time helping his community . let u take my example only , i am a doctor by my profession and i wa an athelete when i wa in my college day . i use to play cricket at national level . that time i had a thought in my mind that i should pick up some beautiful player and train them perfectly and send them for national and international game . i started with collecting the member of various college and i made a real strong group of cricket team . but later when i wa busy with my hectic schedule , i could n't concentrate much on my particular small community and i left them alone which posed a remarkable effect on my mind . there are many community like physically handicapped and oldage people , where the young generation should really look into and try to spend some time helping them out . they can spend little time for them and little money which would make them mentally relaxed and feel well that there is someone who is caring about them . i finally conclude by saying that `` what go around will come around '' . when you do something good for the betterment of the society , that will definitely help you out atleast in later stage of your life .
