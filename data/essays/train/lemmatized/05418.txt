is a person only successful if he or she is willing to take risk ? the definition of success is of course a rather difficult one to begin with and must be considered a highly objective . success can be related to the business world , the world of sport , the home or even to a very private level . i would like to keep my essay a open a possible and not focus on one specific area . if a person stick to a ` business a usual ' policy all the time , i think that apart from not reaching higher goal , this person will also remain in a state of boredom . continuity is a safe strategy in time of instability and must always be considered . however , it should not become the main strategy . if a person take risk , he or she is exposed to several unpleasant possibility . there is of course always a danger of failure involved in all new and unusual approach . people who strive for higher thing and thus take risk are often made fun of . being creative and reaching for the star ha something frightening to other , le adventureous being . another negative effect can be lonelyness . people who have vision and try to live them are often abondoned by friend who can not deal with the high reaching ambition and maybe sometimes with the lack of scrouple that can be detected in the person who stives for success . being a pioneer ha advantage a well , of course . reaching one goal and being successful is rewarded with utter satisfaction and depending on what risk ha been taken it can lead to world wide fame . personally , i agree with the statement . i see the negative side of taking risk but i am convinced that we were born to live our dream even if they may seem ridiculous or even stupid to others around u . it is not always the easiest thing to aim for something extraordinary and it can lead to countless difficulty . it is good to have a mixture of both world : being willing to take risk and knowing when to apply well-known procedure but i hold it with the old saying : no risk - no fun !
