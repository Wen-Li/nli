nowadays , a lot of student go to university because their parent whants to , but it is not their desition . first of all , we can discus the point what the sentence want to tell u with the word `` understand idea and concept '' . undersand a chemestry fomule it will be problably hard . to understand a math concept can be maybe easy . but student really care about understand ? i do not sure because the actuals student in hing school or secondary school just think at the moment and not for the problem they maybe can find in the future at university . on the second point we can discus the second point in the subjet , it the `` leran fact '' . that is clear to say that leran and memorise meaning or formules in any subject than to understand or maybe try to understand something . we problably do not understand it why ? i think it problably because we don-t really think about the future and just to the present , carpe diem , we problably need or try to understand too all of the formules or the meaning of all of the subject . i think it will be easier for u to understand the idea and concept to help u to learn fact to u , because if we do not understand something we can really learn a good a we really understand . we maybe do not have the experience a an student in university , but at the end of the hing school we need to start thinking about this . i am disagree with this sentence because all of student now want to learn and they doe not matter if they do not understand , they just want to know to do , for exemple a math exercice for their exam to have a good grade , without thinking to the futur .
