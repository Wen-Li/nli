i would rather say that , whether one should have broader knowledge of many academic field or should have more knowledge in specialized subject , depends upon the age of the person . suppose , for the student studying in primary , secondary or pre-university level , should have broad concept of many subject and student studying in under graduate , graduate level or post professional or doctoral level should have specialization . because , student studying up to pre-university level are not on the verge of deciding about their future prospect a they are still younger and need to build up the basic foundation upon which his or her whole carrier depends . they should have strong basic fundamental regarding various subject like math , physic , biology . chemistry or any art subject so later on once they get enough sense that , where they should head for their better opportunity base upon their interest , then they will have good , matured , broad mind to decide about it . under graduate , graduate or post graduate are the study where one require to shoot towards mastery in his area of interest so later on , one can avail the good opportunity of employment towards his or her future prospect . at this stage person requires specialized or specified knowledge of one subject to contribute his share on the perticular field to the society and mankind . so that he can be the master of one rather than jack of all . thus , selection of the number of subject should be based upon the stage of that perticular person in his academic level so the knowledge can be justified
