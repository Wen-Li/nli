though to specialize in one specific subject is good , broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than it . there is two reason . first , it is important for u to live everyday . if we do not learn many academic subject at the elementary school , junior high school , high school and university , we face many oroblems in society . for example , a lot of adult would become telling the most important thing . if child watch such a adult , child would become bad , too . second , we learn many academic subject , after that we learn specialize in one specific subject . so we are able to get a lot of knowledge . nowadays , a lot of people learn a subject who like . i think that if such a person incresed , that country will die out . such two reason , i think that we should learn more academic subject than to specialize inone specific subject .
