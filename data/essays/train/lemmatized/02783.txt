the more capitalism governs the life of people around the world , the more we are introduced with newcoming product and idea every day . most of the nation in our world ha become comsumption community and more nation are on the way . what is a consumption community ? it is a community which acquires pleasure from consuming a a primary act of daily life . if there is consumption , it is not surprising to see the inevitable rise of advertisement sector hiding behind it , whose primary aim is to make product seem much better than they really are . advertisements are in everyone 's life . it is enough to listen to radio , watch tv , even walk on the street to meet advertisement . when one think about all the huge money invested into advertisement , you get more tended to trust in the product that is exploited in the advertisement . at least , that wa what i thought , until i had taken the consumer behavior course in my university . i can honestly tell you that this course ha changed my consumption pattern to great extent . in the course , we were provided with detailed information of sale strategy such a how to make a product attractive to consumer , where to put the product on the supermarket to increase it sell , how to jump into people unconscious and make them buy the product unintentionally or how to make people addicted to a product . it may sound just normal to you , but to me it is great dishonesty . that is how i started to question everything i buy and consume . for instance , there are many shampoo claiming that they are the best hair conditioner in the market . but if every brand claim that , which one the consumer have to believe ? have you ever questioned why there are always beautiful girl and handsome boy in the add ? since they give you the message ; `` if you buy me , you would be a beautiful a the girl in my add '' . here is another example , in car add , usually for big car , we always watch cool and successful businessmen who work in high skycrapers and lot of money , giving the message `` if you drive me , you would make lot of money '' . although these example may sound stupid to you , this is what actually happens in our brain . our cognition is so vulnerable that it can not defend itself to all these symbol bombardment . to conclude , advertisement industry is meant to make their customer brand ' product seem much better than they really are . this is how million of brand compete with another . they have to catch the attention of people on the market , on the street and at home . only then he could achieve his targeted profit . we can not deny the fact that human nature ha a tendency to have pleasure from buying the symbol , not the product itself . as a consequence , you find yourself a a part of consumer community .
