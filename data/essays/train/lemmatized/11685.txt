according to the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today i think these statement is wrong . in my opinion car are the most important transportation vehicle in our society . in modern buisness flexibility is one of the most important thing . only the car allows everybody to carry distance at every time he want to every place he need . public transportation system have a lot of advantage especially in big city whith only little space . in these city most of the people are travelling everyday on the same route . but for longer distance public transportation system are not flexibil enough . another argument for my opinion is that having a car make life more easy . for example a car is very usefull if you go to the supermarket buying a lot of box of water or beer . it is impossible to carry these thing by bike or by bus . but one of the most important reason is that people feel more independent when they have car . they are not dependent on other people ore public transportation system . in my opinion people wo n't never give up these advantage unless they can not affort a car anymore . for example i need my car nearly every day because my parent live in a small city which ha hardly any public transportation system . there ar only few bus and they do not reach most of the place . i think public transportation system are to exspensive for small area or city . but most of the people in my country live in small town or village . that 's why a car is so necessary for a lot of people . of course car cause a lot of problem , especially the enviromental polution . but these problem can be solved by inventing new alternative technics . for example it is a good idea to resarch in hydrogen fuel or develop a fuel made of plant . because of all these reason i do not aggree with the statement i 'm asked about .
