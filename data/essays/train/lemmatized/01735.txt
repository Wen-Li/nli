i disagree with the statement . i think that young people nowadays should give enough time to helping their comunities . there are a couple of reason i think this way . let me tell you each reason one by one . first , if young people have chanses to help their community , they can communicate with a variety of people having different social status and being different age . young people , especially student , tend to be together with people of same generation . through communication with people in their community , they can develop their ability of sociality . moreover , elder peeple would teach them their community tradition . accepting their tradition are very important thing for young people . and , in the future , they should pas their tradition to next genarations . second , if young people give enough time to helping their community , they can have oppotunities to donate in their community . larning donation is important for young people . young people have to learn idea of cooperation . also , they have to know well not only their school life and their work life , but also a lot of thing in their communitis . thus , these are reason why i think that young people should give enough time to helping their comunities .
