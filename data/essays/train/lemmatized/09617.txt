i agree with this statement `` in twenty year ther will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . this might be due to increase in population , high traffic and hike in fuel cost . in current scenario , petrolium product cost are increasing rapidly . by comparing cost of the same for past 5 year , rate are increased almost double . this will influence more than any other factor to people to opt for other mean of transpotation . and some people might get think of frequent traffic jam during peak office timing , and find other mean of transportation . from my practical experience i can strongly say that this is very serious problem to think off a i got late to my office , mainly for inportant presentation . other factor which we ca n't avoid is increasing in population and road 'll get conjusted . this case it will be difficult to find a place to construct new road in main traffic area . even it ll be little difficult to government to displace the people , who lived nearby main road to some other place in case of widening of road . from other positive side , since all metro city are opting for mts ( mass transportation system ) , people can easily change their mean of transportation andcan avoid having car . and other way to forget car is by staying in a walkable distance to their working place and other important activity place . as a conclusion by considering all the mentioned difficulty in current trafic problem and advantegaes in mentiond solution to avoid traffic , car may get reduce in next 20 yr .
