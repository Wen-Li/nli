new things and taking risks nowadays when you turn on tv you will probably see a discussion program about the importance of trying new thing and taking risk . although some people think that to be successfull , people should not do new thing which mean risk , i think the best way to become successeful in our era is doing new thing and taking risk for mainly two reason . to begin with , new thing mean new opportunity and a a result of this while people do something for the first time , they also have the change of getting it benefit for the first time . for instance , let 's think that you are the first person who open a hamburger restaurant . in other word you are doing a new thing with high risk level . however you will be more successful than any other person who doe the same thing after you ; becaus you will be able to make a lot of profit before others understants that this is a profitable way . as you can see this will be the opportunity that you get a a result of taking risk . secondly , new thing make people able to do whatever they want and a a result of this , they can easily become successful . for example , mickey mouse is so famous today ; however the inventor of this character tried something new in order to do the thing he had imagined . infact when he planed to draw this character he wa not sure about the popularity of mickey mouse but he took the risk and become successful . opponents argue that , doing new thing mean lot of stress and this prevents people from being successful . however this is unlikely tp be true ; because altough there may be some problem at the begining , after a while the risk taker will probably become sucessfull and then everything will be easier and le stressful for him or her . to sum up , i thinf doing new thing and taking risk are the key facters to become a successful person . i thing everybody should be aware of this . if they are then our world would become a better place to live in . do not you agree ?
