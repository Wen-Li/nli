it is known that a human being we are set apart and distinguished from other specie by the variety of knowledge we gain in our life-cycle . thus , in relation to the previous statement , i personally believe that it is better for an individual to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than specialzing on one only . initially , gaining knowledge from a variety of topic benefit the person himself a he will be able to relate more aspect of his life to more area of knowledge which range from mathematics to the art . this technique of learning and attending to many subject is being currently used in many high school and university . for example , if a student wanted to major in airplane engineering , he would have to take course such a physic , chemistry , mathematics and such science . in return , he would have a complete idea and understanding of carrying out his prospective aim which is to become an airplane engineer . people are also subjected to many situation in which they have to bring together all the knowledge they have gained through their personal or educational experience . it is in specific moment such a these where a person is tested to acknowledge many academic subject . the applicable standard of the betterment of having a broader knowledge only furthermore justifies the importance of it and the great disadvantage of specializing and concentrating on one subject . not is the notion of having increased knowledge from many academic only benefitial for a human 's individuality , but it is also useful in tying link and filling in the blank . as demonstrated in the first example , a person will know more about the subject he is interested in if he can link to it through other aspect . i can come to prove this from my own personal experience . as a theatre arts fenatic student , i have been able to improve my acting skill through another subject i take - psychology . in that class , i have learned the behavioral aspect of a human 's mind and have been able to justify them using biological and environmental indicies . thus , when it come to analzying script and playing different role , i can become a better actor by associating the character to psychological term which are totally true and realistic . in conclusion , having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is better for the individuality of the gainer , his career and help him/her in tight situation where they are subjected to random question that could revolve around any idea or theory . its ' advantage also exceed those of the belief of specializing in one subject which make it a better suggestion . moreover , having more knowledge truly brings out humanity and drive them to their full potential and benefiting the world .
