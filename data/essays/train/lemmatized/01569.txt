young people enjoy life more than older people do . this statement make u wonder how can one define enjoyment . being subjective not only from person to person but also from time to time , enjoyement in totality refers to satisfaction of one expectation and desire . in the case of older people , who have `` enjoyed '' the best of their youth , old age brings about a sudden restriction in term of what they are capable of doing and what they must learn to live without . no one welcome this change but some find a way to remain satisfied and happy in there restricted life . these older people continue to enjoy life . but we find that they form a minority . in the case of young people , faced with limitless possibility , aspiration and expectation are soaring high . these youngster are willing to do whatever it take to have a good time . they defy rule , and set new boundary for themselves to try and cross . life for them is like a window . their expecations represented by the horizon and their desire by the distance from the window to the horizon . they can only do so much while their youth last . comparing the two , we notice that while the youth end up enjoying more than most older people ; in comparison with the limit to which they could have enjoyed , the older people have a higher sense of satisfaction . they know their boundary and make the most of their life eachday . almost everyone enjoys their youth , but people who can learn to enjoy their old age aswell are the people who have truely enjoyed `` life '' . so in conclusion , i would like to say that young people enjoy `` youth '' but older people enjoy `` life '' .
