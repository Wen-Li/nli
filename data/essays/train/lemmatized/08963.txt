advertisements are designed to sell a product , and to that end they can go the extra mile that might just push a customer to buy it . .. this can sometimes mean that an advertising company will resort to sensationalist announcement that could fall into the category of miraculous in regard to what the product can do for the consumer , and sometimes it merely result in an extensive and colorful use of human language . in the case of those advertiser that would aim for exagerating the effect their product will have on their consumer , a great deal of colorful metaphor and even lie might used . a diamond ring could miraculously make the consumer look younger and more successful than they really are while in reality it all depends on the consumer 's ability to `` dress for the occasion '' . a dietary product might reduce your waistline to that of the skeletal model you see in a magazine or that of an actress in a movie , when in reality you would probably have to have a balanced diet and - more often than not - an exercise regimen . where using language colorfully is concerned , we can often observe skilled writer with an ample vocabulary available to them a a mental arsenal developing piece of literary art that charm the consumer . this is by far the preferred method a it intention is not to propagandize or sensationalize ( a would be the case of the first case ) , but to use language in a lyrically enticing form that catch the roll of a tongue or that particular inflection that might season a simple phrase to the point of perfection in the ear of the beholder . in the end both case do in fact make a product usually seem much better than it is . in rare case will a product satisfy the consumer a much a a well written piece of literature covering the product . it 's my belief that the aim should always be for the product to be exceeded by it actual value or effectiveness . .. however , it should never be at the expense of the veritable truth of the product . after all , creating fiction regarding a product could lead the consumer to driving a lawsuit against the company responsible for it development a well a the advertiser . .. we live now in a world where the public demand quality . .. even though it seek fantasy .
