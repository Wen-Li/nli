i completely agree with the statement . advertising is for definition false , it primary task is that of convincing , persuade or bring someone to do or buy something . in doing this , it can rely on a number of strategy . the first one is presenting a product with many more quality than the one it really ha . a perfect image , or a modified picture , can catch the attention and convince the public . also , i saw a lot of advertisments omitting the negative thing concerning the product . i think anyway that we are conscious of this but we accept it . when i read a newspaper for example , my attention focus on a nice coloured picture and often i do not spend time reading at the bottom of the page what is written in little character , even if i know if i woud read i would probably find something bad about what first impressed me . or also , i am watching tv and there is a famous actress advertising the new lipstick of a brand . .. immediately i feel like i want it , so i go and buy it . but when i have it i realize it ha nothing more than the one from the supermarket i had before ( sometimes it could even be worst ) and it wa just more expensive . anyway these are the rule and law of advertising , they have to sell and they do everything it is permitted in order to reach their aim . advertising the false is not legal , but they always find a way to escape this crime and a i said before it is also our fault a costumer . i am convinced that there is a kind of silent agreement between u and the advertiser , a in some way we support this . to conclude , yes , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , but this is also our chance to get in touch with an ideal world . the fundamental thing is being conscious .
