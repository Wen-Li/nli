young people enjoy life more than older people it is convercial to say that young people are more happy than older people . but i would say that when people are young , they enjoy their life by being with boyfriend and girlfriend . they like travel all over the world and get a chance see the tourist place . if they have their wife with them , they enjoy their life sexually . some people young people are homosexual and some young people prefer to have a sex with young girl . they are really happy to enjoy doining sex . but it is not always true that young people enjoy their life . because in this age stage , young people have a responsibilty to look for their family , so they have to work more in their young stage . in another side , older people are also happy in the older age . because they do not have to work much more in this age . their life is happy . they do not spend much more time on work because already have gone through their working stage . in some country , government also suppot to the older peope financially . so in this age , most of the older people spend their time to eat in hotel and restaurant . in village , older people like to spend their time with their grand childrens , and sitting together with older people and making comedy and joke . in this age age older people also spend their life by sharing their idea and opinion with their older frineds . but there are also some other bad experience with older people in this age . even if older people have worked enough in their younger stage and earned a lot of money , sometime their young childrens do not accept them to stay together . they are also not able to enjoy their life sexually in this stage . to sum up , both side are equivalent in the daily life of the young and older people .
