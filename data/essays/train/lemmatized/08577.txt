i totally agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are several reason to support this argument . define fact ? fact is a statment or theory put forth by an individual or group of individual or an organization . a student can memorize a lot of fact without understanding the purpose behind the fact . a fact can be true or false but definitely can be proven by an individual if the student can understand the idea and concept . for example , in the past people believed that the world wa a straight line but couldnt be proven since the resource were insufficient or people were willing to accept the fact rather than spend time , money on it . a greek scholar stated the earth wa spherical but wa unable to support his statement . students need to spend more time on the idea and concept underlying the fact . it improves the student ability to broaden his idea , infact could possibly lead to rewrite some of the fact which ha been there for century . many fact are interlinked with each other . therefore disapproving a fact can lead to revision of other fact that are linked to it . understanding idea and concept can help the student easily memorize the fact . therefore , it is an important factor that student understand the idea and concept .
