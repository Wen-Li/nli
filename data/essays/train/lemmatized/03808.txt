some student prefer to study only exact answer for exam ; however , some people take their time to understand the idea and concept of topi . i prefer to understand the idea before than learn only fact . when we were child , we used to take a lot of quiz and test at school . i remember that i used to memorize all of the answer for test for following day ; however a soon a i test finished , i forgot almost the answer . what a tragity !!! this is the main idea of support my side opposes to only memorizing fact . when people try to memorize thing not knowing the idea of topic , fact do n't stay their brain longer . although if we study procedure of idea and concept , it make a big difference . here is another example . either medical department or science department , student have a various type of experiment . they have oppotunities to learn how and why answer in the text book are made moreover they actually experience themselves using their actual body to prove answer . those experiment definitely support them to memorize so that they do n't forget answer easily . as i stated above , only knowing fact are sometims help student to pas the exam ; however , if they concern about career , they realize that it is not working . at a work environment , especially specialized field such a engnerring , worker are expected to show their knowledge and ablities straight away from school . it they only concentrated on their studying in memorizing fact , do you think they can be stated a good worker ? the answer is no . as a result , student should understand idea and concept before learn fact because they help them to understand topic in depth level and also there is a benefit when they think about their career .
