i definitely would not like to opine with this statement . i would rather like the same statement if it slightly rebuilt or modified . first of all , whom should we consider successful people ? those who tried new thing just in time when there wa demand and that too in their field only or those people who contributed to the complete generation of the idea relevant to the topic . well in my opinion there are many people who hit the limelight by making lot of money . do we call them successful people ? if that wa the case i would agree if microsoft ventured into the steel segment . i would agree if dell start to sell pizza in the future . i would agree so if `` intel '' can start a university and so on . you can ask thousand of question like that for yourself . but the crux of the matter is , how much a person know about his/her business ? how much is the quantum of knowledge or trend generated by him/her that is applicable in toto various other field . how often is the risk experienced by the people that necessitated for such innovative concept . you often find people investing money in invention only to sustain their own business . i would not like to call them successful people . i feel that the chain store run by some business entity should be considered successful . in chain store , the product are being sold , the variety of product and customer service increase . this inturn , increase his expertise to sell various other product . you can talk about a grocery store owner selling cosmetic and then start to sell medicine , and then a gas station and so on and excelling in all the area of business . this in my opinion is called success , the concept acheived in one store is being built across various other field . there
