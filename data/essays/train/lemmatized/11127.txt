the world now is full car . actually it is beleived that the number of car now exceed the number of built house . so is this situation about to end at least in the next twenty year ? in twenty year from now i do n't think that there will be fewer car in use than there are now . i beleive this is true for many reason . the first reason is that developing or obtaining any vehicle or tool replacing the car either in size or in price will require a long period of time actually much longer than twenty year , besides it will cost a lot of money so the replacing thing wo n't be cheap and most of the ordinary people wo n't be able to afford it so they 'll prefer to buy car instead . the second reason behind my thought is that car price are now decreasing , most of the people now have car actually not only one car but many car , for example , if i am in anybody 's place why would i replace a car that does'nt cost me a lot with another thing that is still new and will actually cost me a lot of money ? the third reason is that one of the main problem caused by car nowdays is on it 's way to be solved within very few year . this problem is the pollution caused by the consumption of the car fuel . i 'm saying that beacuse research is being done now to find a replacement for fuel , that 's because we need a more cleaner replacement so a not to pollute the air , also because the world is running out of fuel and the cost of searching for and extracting the remaining fuel is very high if compared to the cost of developing a replacement for fuel . an example to support what i 'm saying is that recently a car wa invented that work with heat energy . another one also wa invented that work with water . the reason stated above were the reason that made me think that in twenty year there wo n't be fewer car than there are today .
