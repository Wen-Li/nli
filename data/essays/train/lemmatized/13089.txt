i am disagree with the statement , and i do not believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than are there are today . in twenty year the world will look like very different than is today . in the future there will be more tecnological advantage and the company will construct diferents type of transportation similar to the car . for example , will be machine that can go over the earth and watter and flight into the air , and everyone can have one , because the cost to manufacture will be lower . also the people want to go far away or faster , becasue their need will change over the time . altough this view of the future , there will be people that think in the enviorement , and the people will be prefers use the bicycle or other transportation that do n't cause a damage to the earth . if a can live in the future i think i will below the group that protect the enviorement , and i will prefer to have a clean air than a car . however , the perspective that i have of the future is a little negative , the industrie grow really quickly , and the technology help in the development of the world , but also help in the distruction . the want and need of the people change , they want to have more electronic thing for have an esier live . also the time will be preciose in the future , and they need to have a car to go to the job and meeting in a fast way . that is way , i believe that there will be more car in the future . finally , if in the future will be more car , i can help in the construction of this transportation , and that will be something that do not damage the world . i am an industrial designer , therefore , my work is create a positive perspective of the future and design positive thing that help the need of the people in the future .
