advertisements all way make for exagiration , attraction and confussion the costomers than peresented the reality of the product , and iam astrongly agree with statment that `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they realy are '' , for the reason above , first , advertisement make more exagiration that seem the product is perfect but in the reality we find the product is le than good , for example : one company produce banana juice , and abig advertise for that product , when i baught that banana juice i taste it then , i feel unable to take it agian . secondly , some company make ahuge color on cover of the prodect to attracc costomers , in the end i find the prodects are le in the quality . thirdly , most advertisement make confution to costomer that make them unable to determain the quality of prodect . in the conclussion the advertisment allways make the prodect seem much bett
