i can easely imagine that there will be much more car in use in the future compard to today . there are several argument why i agree with the statement , that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all the world population is still increasing very fast . this aspect lead to an simlpe conclusion . more people need more car . especially the population in the city are growing , because there excits an movement from land to the city for the last year . for the people living in this big city or the little town neaby , it is usual to own a car . so for this reason more car are needed . furthermore there is another very important aspect . the global buisness is getting much more important today and will be the main buissnes in the future . i infer from this aspect , that in the future buisness people , or working people in general will need car and plain much more than today . i can not imagine buisness men without a car even today and in the future it will be much more neccessary . it is said , time is money ! and so it will be in the future . the third aspect i am thinking of is , that people do not have much time today to reach theire destination , because of the very tight schedulethey have . this will not chance in future . today this mainly stand for buisness job , but in the future even this will change . people working outside the city on the field will need more car to get in the next city to provide theire product on market . i think in the future even farmer will try to sell thing online , so a transfer form the land to the customer must be guarantied . you will need more car for this , too . finally these argument are the reason why i think thee will be defentely more car in the future .
