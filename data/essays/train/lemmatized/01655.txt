first of all , i would like to say that i agree with the statement . in my opinion success in life ha to be with risk . one can be doing well in their life ; for instance , one person can be a good profesional in his field , but very often happens that people tends to go following the easy way . for example , our hipothetical person can be a good teacher in a high school nad for that reason he will stay forever in the same school , or teaching the same level of student . he , might be to have quite an interesting life , but while doing the same he is not going to `` grow up '' . i think that for that person would be more interestin to continue studying , try to get a masters degree in his field , and after that work in a college a a teacher at that level . of course , he is going to need to work hard ; teaching in his school , and after that going to the college , and his life during that time is going to be busy and stressful . also the risk he take while trying to fullfil his dream is going to derivate in panic sometimes , but at the end , he will feel that life make sense . sometimes people need to take the risk of changing the place of residence to try to have a better life or job , and they could feel panic . i am always in the opinion of moving on to have new opportunity , which can have the consequence of success . in conclusion , i admire those people that are not affraid of change when the idea is to be a more interesting person and live a more interesting life .
