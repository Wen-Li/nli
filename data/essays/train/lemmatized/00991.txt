although young people tend to have more energy to do something than older people do , i disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people . there are two reason for this : money and experience . to bigin with , the old people usually have more money than young people have . this mean older have more opptions to do something than younger . for instance , when we want to travel somewhere , the panphlets of travel for senior tend to be costly than those for family or young people . this is becouse , the older have tendency to eat better dish or ride on more comfortable vheicles . however , in general , young people focus on the cost . we can also this tendency in panphlets of travel . this show that the older can more flexible how to spend their money and how to select their plan . next , older people have more expereinces than younger people which are based on the long life time . therefore , older people have le possibility to make wrong dicision . for example , when we ca n't decide which way to choose about something , we are often consulted by older . this is because , if we decide wrong way , sometimes we recieve inconvenience . this mean that older poeple can avoid such inconvenience by their own judgement . for these reason , i take issue with the idea that young people lead more enjoyable life than old people . each group of people can enjoy their life a their own way .
