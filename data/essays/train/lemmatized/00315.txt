i 'm agree with this statement for many reason . in twenty year , or maybe in le year , there will be a decrease of car 's number . first of all there are too many car in our city and in many vehicle there is only one person , i hope that in future will be fewer car because people will understand how use car . for example , i live in milan , my city is a very big city and it is very easy see how many are car on our street . i think that , if people want it , it is possible that in one car there are 2 , 3 or 4 person , in this way there will be not some traffic . in second way there is a problem about petroleum and this element can change the approach that person have with their car , the huge cost of petroluem can limit the use and in consequence the number of car . moreover there is the problem of pollution , car came out many toxic substance and in future will be necessary change about motor and , if it will be not possible , we can obbligatory decrease number of car . i 'm very interesting about this argoument because i study chemical engeneer and many of my course speak about how it is possible reduce the amount of pollution or how it is possible find a new way for move respect of the use of car . in the end i 'm agree with the statement : in few year the number of car will decrease even if people think that car are necessasry . i think so for problem correlate with use of car but also because i hope in new technology . in fact it is possible that in future , not too far , there will be more efficace , more beautiful and user vehicle than car .
