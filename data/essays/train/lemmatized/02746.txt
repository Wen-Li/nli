the incredible people are the young ! i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . as the youth of every living creature is full of energy , young humanbeings have the energetic power of living , too . they inspire life more deeply than the older people do . they live , think , speak and feel the life in a way more enjoyable than the olders . life is full of activity and feeling that should be lived with more enjoyable way . when we look at this sort of activity , we can easily remember the most activity done more enjoyably by the young . music and concert of any singer they most like to listen to . dancing with many incredible music performed by group of known and unknown performer . sporting activity a football , basketball , swimming , rugby , tennis , ice-hockey , diving and so an . as you might have noticed these all sort of sportive activity are full of energry and enjoyable feeling . young people are full of adrenalin , a hormon being secreted from the organ of kidney . it is being inducted to be secreted whenever the body is in stress . let me explain some situation for the higher level of adrenalin in the blood a traffic accident causing fear and real injury to the body , surgical operation performed for some reason to improve the function of one or more organ of the body . but , above all , the young people have burst activity which mean they can shout and get angry very easily . additionally , they can enjoy very much in whatever they are doing . this mean again high adrenalin in the blood . to sum up , young people do not have much concern for thier future . they feel , think and live in the way they much enjoy . it is clear that time pass without any hesitation and we are all getting older . i do absolutely agree and support that every one should learn how to enjoy life a the young do .
