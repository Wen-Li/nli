i think that concept are colse to the idea of model and system . facts are close to the idea of operation . in this way , i think for student is more important to learn how model and system work than to have a detailed knowledge of the operation or fact . probably we can use an example to better explain my opinion . for istance a student could know everything concerning art hystory : the art movement , the life of the main artist , chronological fact . this knowlege is an important base to start a career a an artist but it is not sufficient . i mean that to be a good artist the student should learn and understand the logic and the principle , important to produce creativity and art . if the student 's intention si to become a painter , he need to understand the color system , the concept of composition , the rule how to evoke emotion and how to capture viewer 's attention . i think that we can also use another example to present this point of view . schopenauer , the philosopher , said that it is not important to read the newspaper everyday in order to undesrtand the world , a well a it not imporatnt to read avery second on your watch to check the time . in my opinion this is a brilliant example of the importance of synthesis and learning . facts are important to shape the reality , fact are also important a background for our learning . on the other hand , idea and concept are important to create debate , new thought , new innovation and creativity . even if inspired by classic rule , idea for example were at the base of the renessaice , a movemnet wich mean re-birth . so , fact are mainly importnat to help student in finding the concept behind them . so fact are an iportnt sorces of information and inspiration but idea are the key ingredient able to move the world and mankind ahed .
