i think that number of car will decrease in the next twenty year for two reason , economical and enviromental reason . the economical reason is that car are becoming more expensive and they need more gas which is actually becoming expensive too . people are expecting upcoming shortage in their money because nowadays everything is expensive and it doe n't seem that there is a solution for that problem in the next two decade . and car copanies like ford an mitsubishi did n't sell the amount they expected to in the last couple of year . so people are getting used to other type of vehicle to move around such a bus , train , taxi subway and motorcycle or bicycle . it could be because they are more convineint to them and it 's easeir to get to the place they want to go to and avoid the traffic and the rush hour . and that 's exacly what 's happening in dubai , where a person can stuck in traffic during the rush hour for three hour ! that 's why dubai 's government started to build a high speed train that roll around the big city and it 's expected to be done by the fall of the year 2007 . another reason is that people are getting more interested in nature again and the botanical life , so a lot of club and tv show like `` the green light '' are found now to encourage people to get rid of their car and use different vehicle that wo n't make such pollution a the car do or may be use public bus eventhogh they are polluting the atmosphere also , but they are moving anyway even if nobody us them ! so why making more pollution by using car while we can use those bus ? ! people now are convinced of this idea and they are using public transportation more . so that 's why i think that number of car will decrease by the next twenty year because car are really expensive so people ca n't affored to buy them and they do so much damage to the nature by polluting it .
