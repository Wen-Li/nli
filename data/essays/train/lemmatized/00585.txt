i think that this is a generalization of the young word , and so i think that it is not a true statement . might be true the fact that a part of young people doe not help the other person who need their help , or doe not put their ability or competence for a ` better word` , or simply a ' better local community` , but is also true that there are so many guy that every day make their ` good action` , or work hard for a right ideal to find a sense in their life . for example there are so many boy and girl that dedicate their free time to helping poor people , or to visit sick people , or simply help an old woman to cross the street . is not that also an act of civil sense ? on the other hand i think that pheraps nowadays it is difficult to help the community , because the community make see and think you what she want . to explain , if a young boy doe not respect some civic rule , or he doe not care the others , it is just because the community doe not teach him to give importance to this important aspect , because the community make see a winner model that is not a good model of person . but the young person have more than sometimes the necessary strenght to go on , indipendently by wrong scheme , to track his ideal of life , that are really good ideal of life . i think that it is the point : a young person is more encoureged to change the society by his inexperiece , but at the end is society that change him , and corrupts him making of him an adult person . in fact this is the main passage from the young age so my opinion is simply that the society might change to help young to change her .
