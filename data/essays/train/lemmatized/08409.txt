`` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , agree or disagree ? what a difficuilt question . thinking of the answer put you in a closed circule , there is no definite one . `` enjoying life '' is not dependent only on the factor of age , despite that we say that `` inorder to enjoy life you have to feel young from inside '' , for my opnion age is one of the least essential effect . to approve with this statemant or not , first we have to clearify what is the interpretation of `` enjoy life '' . i think that we do all agree that it differs from one individual to the another , depending on their character , their goal in life , their aspect , opnions . . etc . talking of my self , enjoying life mean to me : travelling through the world , to be in everywhere in the world and not only to pas by also to learn from it , to be interested in any new thing including every single field in life , to enjoy mean to work hard on improving yourself , your socio-economic level , your intellegence , your personality , to enjoy mean to introduce new people , because knowing new people encounter you with their life experinces , and that enriches your experince , and your thinking , your mind . for me practicing all these thing is `` enjoyng life '' , and not doing them mean , for me , your are not living .
