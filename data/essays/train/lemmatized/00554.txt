`` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , i agree with this statement because young people are more enthusiastic than the older people . as it is the time for the young people to enjoy they should rock their life , cant find time to enjoy when they are old . the older people hardly find time to enjoy a they are busy with their work , thus young people enjoy their life . for example consider young people they have lot of time to enjoy with their cousin and friend , but older people meet with thier cousin when they attend party . thus young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people , while they are busy with their academic , still find time to enjoy i.e in holiday . young people get holiday after their completion of course ( i.e one or two month ) . but older people do not get much holiday to enjoy , if they for a leave they get only few day i.e hardly one week . for example , young people enjoys a lot on their holiday by going to movie , rocking with friend , attending party and going tour in their vacation , but older cant do this a they dont find time . thus young people enjoy life more than older people do . hence considering the above point we can say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . thus young people find more time to enjoy their life than older people . so , young people should enjoy their life to maximum extent a they can not enjoy when they are old .
