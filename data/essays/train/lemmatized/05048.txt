in the world that we live in , we can not afford the limitation that we state to our knowledge . this a personal barrier we unconsiously establish in our mind , limiting our personal objective 's optimum result . we compete every day with more developed and evolutionized mind . qualities that a person may posse , may limit the desire to abroaden their study . some determination , obstacle or maybe the lack of interest may affect one study . setting and focusing the mind is an essential fact for abroading knowledge . determinations may hold one back , establishing olny to study what they are truly passionate to study . what people do n't see is that to have to optimmum product towards being the best at your passion , one must be prepared for everything and anything . obstacles may be presented at a road towards succes , but the key is to overcome the obstacle and learn from them , exposing every day the best of anybody . another thing is the lack of interest one may gain if the subject to study is of extreme boresome . it may be a teacher 's fault that the subject is of dislike , there by causing the desire of the student to only study the specific subject and terminate the agony . i agree with the statement , `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject that to specialize in one specific subject . '' . i want to be a veterinarian , but to be successfull in the job i want to pursue , i have to study abroadly every academic subject i choose . this will prepare me to confront any obstacle that i may enconuter on the road to success . in conclusion , limiting our knowledge is not an option , one must always exceed the limit . this is the road to success , to be the very best one can be , knowing the most out of our knowledge .
