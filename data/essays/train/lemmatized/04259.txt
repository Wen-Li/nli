i disagree `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . the reason why i disagree this statement . because i think we should try our best to do anything . first , i think we should try our best to do anything . for examplan every people will watch tv and do same thing on the tv . it mean people try new thing and take riseks rather , but they only doing what they already knoe how to do well . this is no good for u because we should learn a lot of knowlegder and history . than we can communicate with other people and understand what people talking about . the other point is about we should learn and find a lot of information each day . if we donot understand something we should find someone to help or we can go to library to find some information to help u . although if we always try something we know and donot try something we donot understant . it will make u look like childer . the other point is about we should learn something diference school than we will grown up . for exampla , environment , relationship , history sush a those . i always try my best to anything , if i donot how to donot something i will ask someone who know that and let them help me . however , i think people try new thing is good but people always should try to learn something thety donot know . that is best than only learn they konw . i hope even one can do this . if you can do this thing you will try you bert more that befor . i hope each one can do that .
