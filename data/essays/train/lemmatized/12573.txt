i do not agree the idea that it is bettr to have borad knowledg of many academic subject to specialize in one specific subject . i have tow reson of it : our job and interesting for people . first , specific skill are useful when people find their job . most of campanies want people who have them , because they can give the campany new idea or new skill . in fact , when we have interview test for enter some company , we need to apeel our unique point and difference from others . specific skill are provide for good work . second , to specialize in one specific subject is interesting for ourselves and for people around u , because people who have their specific subject know something that everyone do not know . they can choose only one subject what they want to study , moreover they can give everyone surprising , interest or notice . for example , my teacher wa major in japanese history at university so he ha specific knowledge of it . he often tell his student interesting story . we do not know most of them so we always be really amaized but his story is really interesting . in conclusion , it is good for u to have one specific subject in that we can get our job easily and we can give people around u amazing . if you have it , you are looked a a great peason
