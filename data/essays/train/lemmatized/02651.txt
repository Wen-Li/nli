cars are the best way of transprtation and it the most popular thing arround the world , and now a day the house without a car is nothing and that for it uncountable benefit , like shopping , travelling , etc ... , so that i think that car will still existent for hundred of year . the world is getting civilized all the time and we are sure that there are many invention will appear in the next twenty year but it will not be better than the care and it cant take the car 's place a the best way of transportation around the world an that for many reason . in our community we have poor and rich people but both of them can have a car because you can find expensive and cheap car a you need , and if their any thing will replace the car , it will not be more suitable than the car for the people . now a day car is evrything and without car you cant live because it help you to reach any place and to do what ever you want to do and to travel and it also help a in the emergency situtations . in my opinion car is agift from our god and if the inventor do what ever they do , they will not find any invention like the car or any invention to replace the car ,, becaue there isnt anything will be more comfortable for the hamanity than the car .
