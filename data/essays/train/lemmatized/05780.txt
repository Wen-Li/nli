i agree with the statement that successful person try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already learnt . i go with it because i have many illustrious example which out weigh the statement . firstly , there adage that successful person doe thing differently but not do different thing . they analyse the scenario by laying out previous experience and change them for better result . for example deerubai ambani who brought new revolution in many industry a he developed . for example let u take his relaince mobile , he used cdma techonology and reduced price of the other merchandise product . though the reduction in price he got many profit . another , consider great mahatma gandhi , he is known by his priciples of non violence . his new movement of boycott bring freedom to many country . there is a lot of risk and pain in that way but he never wavered , continued to bear the pain and won the battle . another , can you imagine same art and architecture around the world ? . can you imagine same work every one do ? . if they go with the old established principle now world can not be improved and there is no new technology . unless we go and try new benifts and innoate new idea we can successful in present world . example , in my school age i wa used to mug up all the formula for the math exam and used to get low score . i used to face this problem because that time i dont know the derivation , after recognition of this i tried to find the derivation of the formulaes and that wa my great success when i wa child . here i want to give example of newton who wanted to know why the apple is fell down from tree ? . from above mention point can accept that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
