yes , i agree with the statement . young people are the future of the world , they remain active in thier young period but while they get older they loose patience , concentration and the body organ get weak , they may see inactive comparing with young people . as young people have many dream and have many goal to achieve . they work accordingly to achieve their goal and their age is in the stage that they are ready to do anything , young people say and prove ` nothing is impossible ' .they can jump , play and enjoy the wholelife at maximum extent . well about the older people they will loose their patience , they have to look after whole family and would face many problem regarding family and now they have no strength to do more work , no strength to dance , jump and travel . for example , let take my young cousin , when his family went for an holiday including his grandfather who is 70 year old , my cousin explored whole city and visited many religious place , which make him happpy or he may enjoys that . while his grandfather who is also interested to see those place but due to his physical weakness and due to the temperature variance he did n't resist at that palce . and many place are in the hilly area which are to be travel by walk , a his grandfather have no strength he did n't enjoyed the trip . young people have many way to enjoy their life at maximum . now-a-days young girl are the main factor for their enjoyment , they go out with their girl friend in which they find much enjoyment . but older people ca n't do that a they are married they are restricted to thier limitation . this is a silly example but it is a huge reality statement . i conclude by saying that young people will have more fun in thier period by comparing with the older people . due to their strength and enthusiascim which can find more in young people rather than in older people .
