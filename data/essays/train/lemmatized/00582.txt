some night ago i sat on my bed and tried to learn for a very important testpaper i should write the next day . the subject wa biology and so i tried just to learn the fact about the different process in the human organism . but a i wrote the testpaper the next day , i realised that this wa no good idea . i could write down what i had learned , but i did not understand anything . all the different process . .. i had really no clue , because i just knew some simple fact . this ha been an silly experience for me because i always did it like that . but today i realised that this is not the way it should be . i am in school to learn something . i want to know and understand what my teacher is telling me . perhaps i would like to explain other student what i have learned or try to help them if they do not understand something . but if i just learn some fact , that will not work . students should really understand some process , idea and concept , because this is what stay in mind . they should learn for their lifetime and not for a 10-minute-test in school . sure there are subject where learning fact is the easiest way to get good mark . sometimes there is no logical princip for me which i can follow . but i think this is not often in one life . in this situation it is definetly more important for them to learn some fact than to know nothing . but because i am a student i know that it is most of the time possible to understand the idea and concept the teacher try to explain . so my opinion is that many student are too lazy to learn concept , therefore they learn some fact . the problem is that they forget the fact after a little pause , while if i have understand the main idea i will always remain me at this . students are learning for their lifetime and they should learn effective . what doe it help someone if i know the fact of the processe of the photosynthesis for three day , but never realised what importance the photosynthesis ha for the humanbeeing ? i am definetly convinced that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
