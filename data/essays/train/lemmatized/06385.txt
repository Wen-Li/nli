can we imagine a day without advertisement ? advertisements are nowaday a big part of our economy . a business plan have to be prepared with a specific policy a regard advertisement . i agree with this statement for many reason . first , in my opinion , something advertised is presented to the population a the best one in it best presentation . it occur when we seean advertisement for food . when you have the food in your plate , you appreciate the difference . then , most pepole a credule . they have not the knowledge to compare or to juge the product . principally the old person when they have to buy for example a television . next , an other big part of the population is very influenced by advertisement . they see it , buy it thinking that is the best and seek the difference with an other different . as long a the rule do not change , the advertisement system will still edge up .
