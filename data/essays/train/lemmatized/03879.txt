young people seemed have everything becouse they are young and they have energy for doing anything , so it seemed like older people have finished to enjoy their life along thier age . also , it sound that young people have much more ambitious than older people , in fact , it must be misunderstand . it can not say that young people enjoy life more than old people becouse both age have advantage and disadvantage , also older people might enjoy life more than young people do . first , a i mentiond before , an advantadge of young people is their age . they have a lot of time and long distance for the end of their life . it is certainly the advantage of young people which older people do not have . howevver , young people do not have enough money even if they had time and ambitious for their plan for enjoying life . therefore , young people should not only think about enjoying life with plan also need to work on their job for getting money . second , although older people actually have le time than young people , it mean that old people have been working for getting money . hence , they have enough money for enjoying their plan . they have almost same ambitious a young people have . besides , they have a great experience of enjoying life through their working life . there have not been only interesting experience , also some bad or miserable experience . however , it can be a part of enjoying their life a well . here is the biggest diference between young people and older people . so , i think that older people are enjoying much more than youngers . in conclusion , enjoyment of life is related to it age , and i disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' . both young and older people have the advantage and disadvantage .
