i do n't agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , i believe the opposite statement which express that older people enjoy life more than younger people do . because i believe there are several reason that prevent youngers to be more effective in their own life which can be based on the fact that the young people should spend much time by studying for exam or by having stress because of the uncertainity of what they will confront in their future . time that pass too fast , ha a strong pressure on youngers which prevents to enjoy from their life . but when we think of a 60 year old adult who had earned enough money till that age of her life and prepared a good opportunity to be able to supply a good education to their child , ha her peace and she ha no more challenge with life any longer . therefore , she ha a huge time to have fun , and nothing to loose except money . besides , because of the fact that time pass so fast , a 60 year old adult doe n't think of anything else except having a great time till her death . as the person feel that death is sooner coming , there wo n't be any other struggle or any fight with life whatever the reason is . as i give my mother a an example , she is a typical retired teacher who ha enough money to live , and ha no responsibility for looking after a child . for that reason she feel free to live without thinking of any doubths or fear . she is going to trip with her friend and having great time with self satisfaction . she life her own by the power of not having huge responsibility such a earning money or looking after a child . consequnetly i can express that when i look forward future , i would rather to be more older just in case to be able to be more effective in life , by not just trying to do what life requires and also to do thing for myself either .
