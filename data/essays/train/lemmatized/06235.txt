newspapers are important for person to read because in there there are many article and so they can inform themself about the newest thing which have happened in the world around them . very often advertisements are in there and with them the reader can see which new produchts he can buy in the supermarket around the next corner . but most advertisements make the product seem much better than they really are . newspaper advertisement are good to sell thing because there the reader ha a picture and he can see how the article look like . in the shop he can look directly after this article and ha a picture in his mind and he know what he ha to look for in the market . it is very positive for the person who sell the product when he or she can make a newspaper advertisement because then everybody know that this product is introduced now . in an advertisement there are normallz information so that the normal person get to know some detail like for which age of a person a bodylotion or a creme is concepted . when the person is 15 then he get to know that he doe not need to buy this creme that is producted for a person that is over 30 . when this article look better in this advertisement then mazbe more people want to buz this product . sometime it seems to be better to have an advertisement in a newspaper for some article because if there were no advertisement then nobody would know that there is a new product on the market . i agree with this statement because it is right that person are mostly influenced by newspaper advertisement . for this the designer of advertisement make the product much better than they are and the product always look better than in reality . i think that everz concern ha the right to influence the costumer with this advertisement . a conclusion is that product are praised better in advertisement than somewhere else . it is alwazs better when the advertisement look better because then more people want to buz this wonderful and unknown new thing which is praised in this advertisement and laugh at them .
