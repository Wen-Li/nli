i definetely agree with the statement ; in my opinion , idea and concept are indeed extremely more important for student than mere fact . in fact , from my personal experience , being a law school student who went through a long school career , the primary scope of learning is getting a real deep idea of the topic and therefore being able to master and criticise them . that ha always been my attitude , since the day i started school . in fact my mother , whose profession is teaching , always taught me that the concept are the most important thing for a student . thus , on the other hand , memoryzing fact , date and name it 's completely useless because a time pass , they will soon become confused , unclear , oscure data until they will complete disappear from our mind . there is no use of knowing a date / name if you do n't know what it relates to . on the contrary , a you learn , if you focus on the idea and the concept , you wo n't ever forget the essence of any topic . accordingly , in my opinion , only by focusing on the substance of the different topic the student can form themselves with a serious knowledge . ultimately , i think that it 's really important for student to think about what they study , to identify the underlying problem that are brought along with every topic and to attempt to form their own opinion about them . only with this attitude , the student will be able to become knowledgeble human being instead of a group of worthless sheep that doe n't know how to think on it own .
