sucess is an equivalent of taking risk . trying new thing are an equivalent of being brave and facing new challenge . i agree that successful people are those who try new thing and take risk rather than staying on their `` comfort zone '' . a realistic example is my personal experience . i wa born and raised in puerto rico . i completed my highschool and undergraduate college degree in puerto rico . in my country , most rich young people attend to american school and this enables them to be fluent in both language , english and spanish . even though that i come from a middle high class family and did n't have the luck of attending to an american school . i learned english watching television and reading english magazine . in addition that i attended to an intensive english summer program . in my junior year of college , i decided to apply for an exchange program at new york university and never thought that i wa going to get accepted . so it happened , i did n't get accepted for the spring semester and wa devasted . i felt like a looser . in the next upcoming fall semester , i decided to apply again and finally got accepted . just imagine coming from a very small island and having to compete with other us native studends . i got very scared but never looked back . i finished my exchange program with a 3.0 at one the toughest business school in the entire united states . that is a true example of success . i decided to try something new and take the risk of moving into a such difficult and fast lane city a new york city . even if at the begining thing do n't work out the way that you wanted . just the fact that you tried that defines success . now a day , after all the struggle i am working at an advertising agency a an account executive and have an amazing appartment in one of the most exclusive neighborhood of the city . although the path wa not easy and pleasant at the end i found success .
