in my opinion , nowadays it 's very important to study and to know a specific subject . because today we live in a competive world , to have broad knowledge of many academic subject mean to spent a lot of time to study , in meantime a student who sutdy only a specific subject spents only some year at university and in future , after degree , he ha the opportunity to work and to continue his study in his specific area . this mean to have a hig preparation on a specific subject . for example in architecture area or in medicine area it 's necessary to study a lot of time to become a good doctor or a architect . so if we imaginate to create a sutding patway that touch medicine and architecture in the same time , i think that it 's impossible to have the same quality , about knowledge , of a specific studing adress . it 's iportant to put in evidence the financial aspect of this model . to study correctly need a lot of money , in particular with scientific mattres , and to suggest a multiacademic preparation it 's really expansive for the state , and in particular for the student . so today we live in really competitive world , every year there are new technical innovation , and it 's important to now a correct use of them . i think with a correct and specific academic preparation it 'll be .
