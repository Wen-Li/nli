i do not agree that life is more enjoyable according to young people than according to elder people . it not a fact which is proved scientifically that young people enjoy life more than older people do . up to me , when you get older you will learn what kind of facility and activity make you happy or unhappy . because of experiencing more than youngers , being older ha lot of advantage . fistly , young people are more interested in trying new thing . but it is not sure that they will enjoy what they do . they will experience an action to learn something . sometimes this action can lead young people to be unhappier than before . on the other hand , when you become older , i am sure that you will be more clear about new thing . moreover , when somebody get older , he or she generally becomes what sort of action change the mood pozitively . as a result of these experience , old people get better time though they had fewer time to live than youngers have . secondly , the age lived teach people to be more patient . that is why older people are tend to insist on doing something even though they were very unsuccesful on it before . usually insisting on something cause to an amazing success . tell me , who find a succesful life lack of enjoy ! as it is expected , instead of insisting on , young people tend to give up doing something that they are not succesful . this giving up is going to be a reason of not being succesful and unhappiness . finally , by the help of the experience and the patient catched a a result of the experience , old people like and enjoy life more than young people do . but it is very clear that one day everybody become older : a a result he or she is going to learn what make life funny .
