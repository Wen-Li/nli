alwasy sucucessful pepole do new thing that other pepole do not wwant to try . charanging new thing ha a risk . many pepole do not want to have risk . however , doing same thing do not bring new oportunitys to get a sucesess . i strongly agree this statement . when i worked in japan a a nurse , there are a lot of nurse in a hospital . half of them have worked in the same hospital for a long time . half of them are nurse who have changed many time to work place . nurese who work same place for a ling time tend to have consabative idea . they do not change new way of care style . of course , keeping traditional style is important , but sometimes it is old fashion . nowadays , medical skill are improving and also need of patient are chanigng ; therefore nurse need change the way of care style or the way of thinking . nurses who work in different hospital have a lot of experences for patient and the wat of careing for patient . their idea are very useful and adovantage . many nurese think changing work place make them nurvas and hard to adjust new circumstance . however , it is good poprtunity to get now knowledge to have new experience . in japan . many pepole tend to work same place and do not want to change their job because it style is very traditional . japanese pepole think changing or starting new thing is not good and keeping same thing is good thing . however , many pepole are not surtisfid their job and they always complain about their job . consequently , a person who be sucsessful always charenge new thing even tyhough they do not succeed soon . doing new thing give u a lot of oportunities and new experience .
