a successful person is a person who succeeds in probably everything life throw at him . some people say that successful people are limited to doing what they already know how to do best . as for me , i think a successful person is one who is not afraid to take risk and and try new thing . as mentioned above , a successful person is one who succeeds in life , and that ca n't be proved unless that person try new thing andtakes the risk , otherwise , if that person is afraid to take risk , then what 's the point of his success ? mean while some people say that a successful person is the one who doe only what he doe best . there i strongly disagree , because for a person to be successful , he/she should take risk and try new thing even if he/she fails at completing the challenge he/she is facing . that person -- in my point of view -- is a successful person ; not the person who succeeds in every thing he doe , but the one who take new risk , face new challenge , try everything in life and face the concequences ; which may be tough but in the end they will be rewarding in every thinkable way . on the other hand a failure would be the person who is afraid to try new thing , afraid to take new risk , and afraid to face new challenge . a failure is the person who think he is successful but is actually limited to thing he/she think he/she doe best . in conclusion , poeople who succeed in life are niether afraid , nor meant to be afraid of taking risk and facing challenge and so on . while those who fail are the one who think that they are successful but do n't try new thing and do n't take risk in life . those are the true failure .
