in my opinion , young people definitely enjoy their life more than older people . there is no doubt that there is an old person who travel much more than young people . but generally it 's not easy for them to just enjoy their life . i have 3 reason to support my opinion . first of all , old people ca n't use their time and money or time for just themslves . normally old people have their kid and even grand kid . let 's suppose a mom decided to go travelling to europe . she will absoulutely consider of her kid first . she ca n't leave her kid for a long time by themselves a a mom . even if she decided to go there with kid , the cost will be the way more expensive than what she go alone . and also she might have a problem with making schedule which is hard to make a common break time between several people . then now she would start to consider about the plan of trip again . compared to this mom young people can go anywhere whenever they want to . although old person ha no kid , it 's still not easy to make leisure plan . if he/she want to go fishing , they need to go for a walk to the lake and sometimes drive long distance or cross the mountain . then he/she should face on their limited health ability . even the time to wait for fish , he/she will feel tired . you would think that 's a teeny tiny thing . but it infers to everything that they want to do . finally the old people is not willing to take risk . they enjoy to be stable statue which they do n't need to experience harsh happening . that make them not to be able to do what the young people do . i 'm sure this fact is following to personality . but i think young people enjoy more .
