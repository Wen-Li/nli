in my opinion , is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject instead of a specialization in one of them . i say this because i think that is the best solution in order to find a work in today 's society , where company are continously on change and require a huge flexibility and adaptability for the new work . according to this , school must provide to give a basical instruction , teaching many different subject . in this way , each student will have a quite complete background in the fileld he choose . i think that also specialization is important for work , of course , because it implies that a person is really good on doing something specific . but i also think that an high level of specialization could be reached only with year and year of study and work , and school ca n't give this opportunity to everybody . an example : i study design , but lot of kind of design . interior design , virtual design , graphic design and much more . but what i really like to do is web design . so , school give me first the opportunity to learn about different tipes of design and , second , to understand which is the best for me . after the school i can specialize myself in web design by work , because i have a basical preparation that school gave me , and , in the same time , the other student in my class could choose another specialization , according to their preference . this model of teaching subject give lot of advantage , because it is n't neither rigid nor boring . it give anyone the possibility to choose , without create limit . academic subject are only the start up of the student 's working life , that he can and must develope in his career . but at the same time they are very important , because allow the student the opportunity to understand what he really like to do in his future .
