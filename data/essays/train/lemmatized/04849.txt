people have their own idea about whether they concentrate on the broad sujects or not . some people may say that we have to study special subject for developing speciality . in my opinion , however , it seems clear that learning many subject is more important than the sepcific subject because of selection and relation of job . first , when it come to the selection of job , knowing a lot of field enables people to have many option which they select job . it is generally agreed that if we study more subject , we would gain more item of considering occupation . for example , in my case , i majored in environment and i am soldier , in other word , i studied environment a major and explained army skill . therefore , i can select my future whether i would be a soldier or environmentalist . moreover , if people have so many selection , they would fail to live in their life . therefore , the so many selection have positive effect on studentrs . second , a far a relation of job is concerned , some job are relative to other job , people have the common sense that math is similiar to physic , science , engineering and so on . therefore , all subects are relative to any other subject and we can say that the some occupation also similiar to other job . for instance , if people want to be a computer specialist , they should understand engineerinig worker and investor and also know math , science , engoneer and so on . in other word , computer science involve in engineering , math , science and other field . furthermore , in the company , person who work at same corporation have each major and they have influence on each other . therefore , they must know respective field for developing their company . in this way we can say that we must understand many field . to sum up , i agree with the statement in that we had better gain more knowledge from learning lot of subject . if we study many academic subject , we can obtain so many benefit , all thing considered , i can definitely say that we must study many subject .
