to a large extent i agree that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide . especially if you are visiting a new country or place where there could be a language problem then having a tour guide is very desirable . i would like to recount an experience i had when my parent and i had gone to australia on a vacation . australia is a very beautiful country and i 'm fortunate to have visited . we went with a group of twenty people from different location . all of u started off from a common meeting point . the advantage are that all our flight and hotel reservation were booked in advance so we did not have to bother about getting flight and hotel reservation . the tour guide is trained and are well equipped to solve any problem that arise in course of the journey . all local transport wa arranged for in advance so getting from point to point is not a problem . an itenary of the place of interest that we would be visiting on a particular day is handed out so we know where we are going and what we are going to see . the disadvantage are that we have to follow a fixed itenary and can not see or visit place not written in the itenary . the other thing is that different people have different taste , some like visiting museum and place of historical interest while others like amusement park . irrespective of our like or dislike , we have to be together with the group . since we visit a tourist , we donot get to see how day to day life is . finally there is a possibility of not being able to get along with some of the group member . we have to be tolarant towards everyone in the group . i personally feel that the advantage of having a tour guide out weight the disadvantage . these choice are usually dependent on temperment ( s ) of individual , people who are adventerous may prefer to plan vacation on their own while others may choose a path thats tried and tested .
