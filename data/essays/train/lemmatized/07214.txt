is attend a group led by a tour guide the best way to travel ? different people might have different answer . in my opinion , i totally agree that attending a group led by a tour is the best way to travel . the reason why i think so go a follows . to begin with , attending a group led by a tour guide is more relex because i do not need to work hard to arrange a tour by reference many material about the the tour such a the weather situation about the journey and what is the traffic condition . in addition , i do not hve to design the tour . finally , i do not need to drive in a long trip , completely relexing myself to enjoy the trip which led my the tour guide . therefore , i can save the energy and just follow the instruction of the tour . in addition , by attending a group led by a tour guide , i have many oppertunities to make many new friend who have different background , such a coming from different area or different country , having different culture . in addition , i can enjoy the nice talk finally , by attending a group led by a tour guide who have many experience about the tour , i will get a lot of knowledge and information from the knowledgeable tour guilde and from group member who have many information i have never known . therefore , attending a group led by a tour guide is a great idea and i like it .
