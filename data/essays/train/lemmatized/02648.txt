i think it is really more important for student to teach fact rather than teaching the idea and concept . nevertheless , the education system are generally based on teaching the idea and the concept . the idea of famous people and the some fundamental concept are taught throughout the education lifetime . i think this system will not work in near future . because of the technological improvemets , the student have a great tendency to learn the fact and the event in the world . thus , they will begin to ignore the idea and concept . they will deal with the issue which they really exist . they will give more importance to the occurences . i think it would be better when the student learn the fact , after that they can find fundamental idea behind this fact and the student both learn two issue by analyzing the fact . if this system is formed , the student begin to laern the issue by experiencing the living fact . the drawbavk of teaching the idea and concept is craeting an abstract education for the student . the student may never encounter with these idea or concept in their lifetime . however the fact are real and nobody can ignore and run away from these fact . all the student will be adult in near future and will face with these fact . if they meet the fact in their school year , this experience enable them to cope with woe easily . another essential benefit of teaching fact is improving the attention of the student . the example of real world will arouse their attention and i think they will want to participate the debate about the occurences . this system increse the efficieny of education , the other system is so bored in respect of this one . because the student only memorize the idea an concept
