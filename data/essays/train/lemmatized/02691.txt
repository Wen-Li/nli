nowadays , more and more car are produced and sold . indeed , population is still increasing all over the world , developing country are richer and richer asking for all we have in developed country such a computer , building or car . in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today , even if everybody can think the contrary . today , we have many way to go from one point to another . it mean more bus , plane and car of course . even if new kind of transport could be built , car will remain the best way to go to school , work and to go out because there are no a more convenient way of transport yet . that will be true for at least 20 year . moreover , more and more government and association would like to decrease the number of car due to the pollution . however , in the same time , more and more car firm make research in developing new kind of car which could work with new ecological energy such a colza oil , electricity or else water . for the moment , they only experiment these kind of energy , but some car are know working with both petrol oil and electricity . other experience are also being made but it is difficult to know if they are available and cheap . indeed , the problem is also that these new car have to be bought by everybody , so much so that they have to be cheap or rather not too expensive . the last point i want to deal with is that developing country are growing so fast that their need are huge in new technology and consequently in car , because they also have to go to work . their need will be much more important than in developed country . indeed , in developed country , we have sufficiently car , although in china or in india , people who have enough money , and they are numerous now , want and need to have one . to put in a nutshell , cars will be more and more numerous in the world for at least twenty year . cars need will decrease when new kind of transport will be find or discover such a teletransportation or personal plane .
