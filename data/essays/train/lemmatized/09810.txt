there might be a group of people who do not work for their community a well a there are people who work hard and show great effort to improve their community . i agree with the fact that there are more people working hard for their community than who do not care for them . firstly , people who have the right moral attitude and behaviour should be aware of the envoirment they live in . and they should always try to develop it for the better . i assume that our world have enough conscious people to do so . therefore people may be able to leave a liveable world to their child and the others who come after them . however , they might be very busy with their career and their life , improving our envoirment and developing it must include one of their goal . having a good life should not be the only thing they care for or rely on . likewise they wo n't have better enough life in an uncared community . they ca n't live without caring for one another . there are people that suffer from hungar and the war that damage their home . i see on tv that a great number of people are working to make the condition better . they try to find them place to live , adopt the child who have anybody left and fund for their loss . even for the people who do not take action at all , there are campaign avaible everywhere . it is the easiest way for them who do not stand up from their chair they sit and at the same time they would still be helpful . to sum up , if people consider the fact that this world is not only ourselves but everyone 's who life in it , they will probably be more helpful for their community and try to change it for the better .
