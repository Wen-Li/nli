i strongly agree that , it is important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . it is very difficult and there is not much use in memorizing the fact . in olden day teaching method they trained in learning fact but now due to latest technology development all fact are on computer internet available in second of button switch so we dont need to memorize fact . for example if a student memorizes date and event took place in 18 century they may not be beneficial . but the concept and idea are trained they will develop new invention , create wonderful thing . young mind are creative with full of enthusiasm so filling these valuable brain with dead curriculum and dead fact in this 21 century , i dont agree . humanbeings have already developed computer which can store fact . so student dont need to learn them . computer can not generate idea only humanbeings can think a they have a marvel brain which is equal to million of computer . students should understand the concept and they should relate and generate new idea . this process will take place only when we stop filling the brain with fact . through out my education i have experienced learning so many fact like in social science historical revolt . in science invention and discovery date , in maths multiple of table more than 15 . in languages remembering character of play , all the fact i learned were never useful in my life but they scored me low grade . so why not we learn thing which are more useful and beneficial to man kind . so train young generation in developng , understanding new idea creating wonderful thing
