i think successful people should try new thing , because they already know haw to do what they succeeded . so doing same thing is boring and it just make maney . may be making maney is very important but recently many people do not have any porpose to live and only making maney to live . it dose not develope anythig but successful people useally try to make new thing to make society more developped and more convinient . that could be example for the people who do not have any porpose . i think people acturely wanto have excitement in those life . that is the one thing only human is given from god . so people should always try something new and it will be our presiere in our life . i want to success in my majior , because i like my majior and of couse i want to be a rich person for my life and my child 's life . if i do have a lot of maney i can do much more thing i want to do than i do n't . doing new thing would be very exciting , but may be some time it would be very stressful . even if it stressful , iwill be so happy when i success . it 's sound great . doing new thing will make people who are doing new thing happy and also make other people happy . so , in my opinion try to do new thing are very good even for the people who did not success yet . if i success in my majior in my feature , i will try some another new thing , because i want to enjoy my whole life and make maney . much maney is not only way to be happy but it is one of big easy way to be .
