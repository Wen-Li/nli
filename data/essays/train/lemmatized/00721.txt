most advertisemetns make product for many reason . they want to sell their product to earn their money and many people have the experience that when you bought something home and realized that are not useful just like what it appeared in a advertisement . in my opinion , i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better thatn they really are . the purpose of dvertisements is to make their product to be bought . they want to sell their product . therefore , they need to urge customer to buy . they will use everything to urge you to buy their product . althought it look not good to eat , advertisement will use the picture or sound to let it look like delicious . then , advertisement use people 's desire to sell their product . for example , a advertisement which a hot model hold a diet drink will make many woman to buy , because they want to be a hot model . but , in fact , you ca n't just drink the diet beverage and become the hot model . advertisements use that idea to sell their product althought the diet drink are not really working like that way . finally , advertisement only show the merit of product . advertisers want to sell their product , so they exploit the fallacy of a product . they only show the good site of their product . for example , we can see a lot of televsion food advertisement on the television . they only tell you how delicious they are , but they have never told you that how you really tasted . they make you see the good part of product , and you go to buy it , then their goal is achieved . because many reason which they sell their product make the real product are not a the same a they look like in dvertisements . they can be based on the purpose to sell , the use of your desire , and showing the good part to persuade you to buy their product . therefore , i believe that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are .
