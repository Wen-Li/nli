today , advertisement of a certain product , almost a important a the quality attribute that the product actually ha . although , advertisement have important effect on the perception of the quality level of a product , i do not agree that advertisement are capable of making product seem much better than they really are . first of all , it is illegal in my country to provide misleading information or intentionaly flawed data related with a product or service on it advertisement . such an administration , make it legally impossible to try to introduce a product a if it is much better than it actually is . another important reason why i do not agree with the statement is that the influence of advertisement last only for a certain amount of time , depending of the advertisement policy of the product . after that amount of time pass , real quality level of a product become known to everybody , by mean of various communication medium . especially , nowadays , forum on the web site and blog make that period even shorter than ever . for example , if a tv producer , advertises it product a providing the best colour , which is a very subjective claim , and it is not the case , many user of the product may reveal the truth in very short time in various web site . although advertisement are important in the way that a certain product is percieved , they can not change the real value that the community attribute to the product for a long period of time . their primary purpose of advertisement is to highlight the strong attribute of a certain product and can not go beyond that . if a producer try to advertise a product a if it is better than it actually is , it will not only be contradicting with the legal regulation , but also be sacrificing it creditability .
