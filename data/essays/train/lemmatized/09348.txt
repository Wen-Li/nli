not all the time the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . it depends of the country , the age and the manner of the person . when you are going to travel to a country that speak the same language , it is not a necesary to have a guide a if you do not speak the same language . it is like if you speak spanih and you are gonig to travel to germany you need someone to help you to understand , but if you travel to spain is not too difficult because despite that you do not know that country you can talk with them without problem . other thing is that old people do not like to travel with a guide , and young people yes . this is because for example a couple of old people are going to europe , if they go with a group led by a guide , maybe they can not mantain the rythm all the time like waiking up early , walking a lot , or eating in any restaurant . i mean , they are going to want to do the thing in the time that they want , and not be directed by anyone . every change if go a couple of young people , beacuse they are going to want to make all the day activity , and to visit evey part of europe . the manner of be of everyone also depends a lot , because if you are someone that do not like to receive order , or follow instruction , you are not going to accept be led by a tour guide . also if you are not friendly , maybe you can have problem with the other people . with this we can see that it depends of the person and a everything it ha good and bad thing to go with a tour guide .
