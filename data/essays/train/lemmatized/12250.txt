as far a i am concerned , advertisement really are good way to make the product seem much better than they really are . especially in this modern scociety and during this commercial and valued time . during the history of china , there had been some kind of advertisement in the big city : such a the changan city of empreor tang . some owner of the resturants putted the list and the main ingredient of the meal out of the house to attract the customer . sometimes they cooked the meal in the front of the restruants and asked the customer to taste the meal for free . accturally , these free food were very delicious and enough for many people to eat , but if the customer entered the restruants and ordered the same food , they would find the food 's taste is just so so . that is the difference between advertisement and the real product . the product in the advertisement are allways seemed better than the product really are . to tell the truth , i really like to watch the advertisement of the make-up and orther beauty product from tv or newspaper . but i will not buy a product immediatly when i see a new advertisement . because i do n't know if the product is really like what the advertisement say . i often ask for some sample of the product or ask my friend about it . i think it may avoid the risk of hurt myself . anyway , the woman 's face is very important . adervertisment r
