most of people buy the material by watching a television comercials . however , when the good wa very different from the commercial , we waste the time and money after buying it . i sometimes feel some of advertisments are n't genuin material which are couting something else , different color , or kind of immitations . there are some photograpohers who take a picture about the commercial material . so , they are couting something on a genuine food when he want to take a picture . i could n't eat some food without hearing the ture . moreover , the american restaurant in the united state looked very deliciously , but actually i feel bad taste . i like to going to the shopping when i want to buy some clothes which i getting to be a favorite one . the color of clothe is definitely important . in japan , there are diverse color and it 's very difficult to make these color , thus i want to get it with japanese color . however , my favorite clothe are different of color . i claimed these material to shop staff . but they just talked about the photographer is mistook to make the catalogue . when i buy the car , i always look the advertisement which are listed a lot of them . if i felt this car is cool a well a expensive one , i try to buy it . however , it 's totally different from list . because advertising-maker used the immitation material when he make the catalog . in the concludion , many advertising are so different from the genuine thing . we should take care about these truth . whenever we buy something , we should check it on our foot before buying something via the internet or telephone order . we had better to hear the oral communication with genuine experienve about the material .
