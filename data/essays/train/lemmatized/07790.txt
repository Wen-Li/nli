in my own personal opinion it is the younger people a opposed to older who tend to enjoy the experiances and occurances of life more frequently . this most possibly happens because it is the experiances and occurances which are by far more enjoyable than those of an older person . to my belief this is valid in most case no matter what culture or circumstance the person is in . by growing up i have realized that there are three essential thing that change a time go by . the first and most obvious of these is responsability , the second is the availabilty of time and the third is the situation that we are put in . as a person grows up it is forced into much more responsible action . for example a baby or a very young child would have no responsabilities if not only a few , while a the child emerges into his teen he will inevitably begin to feel the pressure of the responsability which need to be taken in school and at home . this becomes even worst when that teenager finish school and realizes that he is faced with very important life decision such a what career to understake , and where to study . after some time a family would obviously create more responsability , especially a one becomes a parent . also spare time begin to decrease a the year go by . this is directly correlated to the the responsability which one begin to have le a the year pas . at the very end of high school it becomes evident that it is no longer possible to sit for hour watching to tv due to the amount of work given during those last few year of school . or perhaps no longer possible to spend most of your spare time playing with your friend , which at one point in your life appears to be a must daily schedule . the situation which we face also take a drastic change . during high school i myself remember wishing each day that it should end a soon a possible . nonetheless a i finished i realized how entertaining high school actually wa . in most case people a they get into college have to undertake a job , which most probably they dont enjoy at all , like myself . it is hard to describe the frustration that arises in you when you realize you are sitting a pointless job for little money while the child outside are playing all day long . perhaps it is important to grow up . one becomes wiser and much more experianced , this possibly allows people to view life in a different way , and appreciate certain moment more , unlike child who are unable to tolerate any sacrifice or difficult task they have to undertake . in my case , i wish i had never grown up . but that is just me .
