knowledge is like an ocean and man get this life only once . only people who have experienced the taste of gaining knowledge can tell very importance of gaining knowledgeth . what exaltation and exuberation knowledge it can have i completely agree that it is better to have broader knowledge of many subject rather than confining oneself to one subject . it will give student a wide specrum of thier knowledge . they are going to know a little about every thing . i just state an example from my own personal experience . when i wa doing my undergraduate . i wa offered a variety af subject . and a i progressed i realised there is interconnection between different concept from different subject for example i studied metallurgy in my first semister . and in second semester i had advance mechanic of structure . first i thought that they had no connection but later i realised the without the metallurgy i would not have been able understand advance mechanis of structure . also one specific subject can make a person master in that subject but he is going to have le job opportunity than the person with wide spectrum of knowledge . a wide variety of subject make a person to be in the tune with the present world i can give an another example of a scientist newton who had knoledge of wide variety of subject and wa able to discover theory which were not related to field . in hindu mythology it is said knowledge brings you closer to god so more u gain the knowledge more closer you will be to the god . knowledge can unravel the hidden secret of this physical world so the more you learn the more intellect you become
