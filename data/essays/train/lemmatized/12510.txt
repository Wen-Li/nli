there are many people prefer travelling alone , while some prefer travelling with group . this preference depends on people 's character and the way of their life . if i go somewhere i would like to be with my friend . i think traveling with group is the best way . one reason i beleive that is , it is very difficult to make new friend for me . i am very shy and not talkative person . traveling would be enjoyable with somebody who l can have a lot of thing to talk and share . otherwise it would be so boring . i have not traveled by myself until i came to the us . after that trip , i decided that i will never travel alone anymore . i thought that this flight would not finish . another reason i think group trip is the best way is , it make be more confident . trying to new thing in new place make me anxious ; however , if l have a friend next to me , i can do whatever i want . it give me brave to do thing which is in my mind . this life can be enjoyable with some crazy thing and that is what we always do with group of friend . finally , friend can make any place enjoyable . even if there is nothing to do , talking with friend make u happy . i can not have fun if l go to the italy to see rome or go to switzerland to ski . these thing can be enjoyable just with my friend . there should be worse situation . for example , if l go to the place that l have not known before and i do not like it , it woulde be so boring . however the group of friend can reduce that easily .
