after u high school , today , we can study all we want like litterature , biology , chemist and the a lot of subject . we can specialize in one specific subject or many academic one . we will see what is the advantage and problem about these school way . according to me it 's a very dificult topic . because i have a point of view but it 's mind and it 's depends of the person . however i will think easier it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . in fact i think we are too young when we finish the high school so it 's very dificult to choose what we want to study for the rest of u life . i know we can change later but it 's normal we want choose the good decision , not change each year and to be in the university when we are twenty six with people olded twenty year . and if you have a many academic subject , we can specialize in a specific sector when you find a job moreover you will have knowledge to know exactly what you want . therefore if you are sure about subject you will study during few year and have a job in link with this subject it 's so great . when a talk about it i think about a person who want to work in a sector who is his hobbie for example . i will enjoy to know what i would like to study and do just that . it 's so good if this subject do your hapinness . how can reproach anyone to study his hobby or passion .
