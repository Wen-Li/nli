i think that to learn idea and concept it is ok but until some point because what would happend if i have a lot of knowledge and i dont know when or how to use it , in the other hand we just cant only know fact because if we just know fact but if we dont have any idea or concept of how to use it , we have nothing . for example if a doctor know all the concept and the idea you have to know about medicine and human body but never work with a person or doe a surgery on his own when he finally have a person in front of him waiting for a surgery he probably be nervous because he have never done a surgery before , but if the same doctor insted of all the knowledge have been in surgery room all the time probably when he have to do a surgery on his own he would know what to do but dont know why he is doing it because he doesnt have the idea or concept . but if the same doctor have a previous expirience with people and some idea and concept he can do a surgery completely sure of what he is doing without the fear if he is doing something wrong . personally i disagree with he preview statement that idea and concept are more important that fact for the example i given .
