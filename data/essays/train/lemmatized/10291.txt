i agree with the idea which more and more young people lose their interest toward community work or voluntary work . then i wonder who is responsible for that . of course young peoele have responsibility by themselves . everytime i go out in tokyo , i see many young people who throw their gabbish on the street without any consideration . i wonder have they ever thought about cleenig crew who mostly work voluntarilly . i also see many young people sitting on priority seat in front of eldery people or handicaped-person on the train . they usually chat with their friend loudly or talikg on the cell-phones . i think these behavior exactly mirror the younger 's attitude toward community work or voluntary work . i blamed japanese youngers , however , i think japanese government also have a responsibility for today 's trend which young peopel do not give enough time to helping their community . basically , japanese school do not require student to work at their community or to joinn voluntary work and there are no class about how imporatnt helping community is . those lackness make yound people lose their interest in community work . lastly , i also think community itself have a responsibility for young people . i am sure that young people do not spend enough time on community work , however , i want to ask the community that they have helped any young people or gave them advice in the community . unless community and young people find out the way that they support and help each other , there is no way that this situation will be changed . i think majority of young people do not give them time to help others in their community . however , i also know some young people are eager to work for their community only because they want to contribute their community . i think young people just have not realized how worth it is . if everybody will change in order to their community better , i belive that the number of young people who join community work will increse .
