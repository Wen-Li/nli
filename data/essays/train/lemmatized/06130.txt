i do not agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . they seem that they have a lot of thing to do for their own benefit or interest , however , there are more thing to be reported to let community know about . i would like to talk about one teenager who i knew from newspaper printed here , melbourne , in australia . recently , there are many tragic car accident on melbourne road . fouty - one people are killed in three month , the government ague that the low need to be more strict so that le people would be killed . however , among the community , there wa a doubt about the government 's opinion . is it the law that can reduce the number of death ? while the government doe nothing about , another car accident happened on a same road where two people are killed a month ago . we are appalled and shocked by ever-increaseing care accident . but this time , tragedy happened with respectable event . there wa a big item whose headline wa ` our hero ' . a fourteen year old boy who life close to the road where accident ha happened , accidentaly saw the car accident and he run across the road to help two people in a crashed car . there were a woman and a baby . he helped the baby farst and confirmed that he is allright . then the boy attempted to help the woman but she wa hardly injured that she could not talk properly . to prevent her from beind in unconsiousness and dying , he kept talking with her . he asked a lot of question and told her the baby is fine . he ha been talking with her for about thirty minute , however , despite his effort she passed away . after all , he went to her funeral with flower . he knew that the woman wa the baby 's mother . he told her ` your baby is ok. ' and he wa thanked by the baby 's father . the baby 's father told him your my hero . but he said , ` i do not want be treated a a hero . i just saw the accident and acted what i could do . ' he ha a blessret which is printed the word ` change the world ' . from the newspaper that i read few day ago , this boy ha done what other teenager would have done . therefore , i disagree the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
