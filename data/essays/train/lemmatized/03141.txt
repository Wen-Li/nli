to have large knowledge is well for your personality but have so much knowledge could destroy your base . when iwas young my dream is to become an engineer in electronic . everybody told me that i have to study a lot to become an engineer one day . thus i did my study in different school with different specialization : architectural , science , communication , marketing , technology , etc . .. i wa very tire at the end of my study because i did differents school , so i lost most part of my life just for study . and what do i become now . do i an engineer ? in fact i understood one thing which is important for me , now i understand that my really dream is not to become an engineer but higher than an engineer . six year before i began my really dream , i mean i study in engineering school after differents school . last year when i had the diploma of engineer , i realised that i need to go higher than engineer . that is the reason why this year i decide to study the mba school . for sure that the mba is higher that engineer even i had it . this is an experience that i would like to share with other people who need it . what did i learn from this lesson . in fact i understood that study to have broad knowledge is important but it is very dangerous and have to be carefully to not go away . therefore specialize only one specific subject is well but you need to enlarge your knowledge to extend the communication with other type of people , that 's mean business man , engineer , scientist . ..
