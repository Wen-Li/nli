i believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it follows that , learning the fact is ineffective for the student a the memorized fact would easily be forgotten . however , student will not forget what they learn if they understand the idea or concept . now i shall state the benefit of understanding idea and concept rather than fact . firstly , a student should try to understand the idea beneath a certain fact in order to remember how that idea work and lead to that fact . what i mean by this is that , if a student learns the reasons-concepts of a fact it will be much easier for him to use that knowledge in the future a he can use the concept to reach to the fact . secondly , learning concept make it easier for a student to see the whole picture or in other word to look in a broader perspective . it follows that , learning through a systematic path will be more usefull for the student a through generalization and specialization student may learn better . for instance , when i wa in high school i wa not able to memorize the mathematical fact such a theorem but then i found it more easy to learn these theorem through learning certain concept and idea that are related to those fact . furthermore , learning the concept and idea appear to be more important a the fact will not be used in daily life situation . what i mean by this is that a people do need to cope with the problem of life by themselves , it will be more reasonable to teach them the idea and concept in order to provide them a model by dealing with their problem . it follows that , fact do not make student clever although they make them wise . however , the idea and concept can make the student clever if they try to adopt these in their life . to sum up , learning the concept and idea appear to be more important a they provide a long-lasting and effective learning . therefore , instead of learning fact student should try to learn the idea and concept a they can remember these in the future and use them for acquiring the fact they need . last but not least , systematical learning is the key to achieve success so learning idea and concept provide this systematical learning .
