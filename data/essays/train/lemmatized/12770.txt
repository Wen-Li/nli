i completely agree with the statement here expressed . we are living in a world where the image of the product is more important of their value . the philosophy of marketing is widely `` followed '' to sell any kind of product . the advertisement now use famous people like actresses/actors or model to sell parfumes , dress or make - up because the message ha to be : if she/he us that product and he/she is famous and beautiful and if i use the same i wil look like her/him so everybody will notice me a well . this is a very unfair game played with `` regular '' people because sometimse nature ha given u a unique physical apparence and we can not change what is unchangable unless we go for the plastic surgery . .. i do not want to make a general statement about the product and the way they are pictured , sometimes we have quality beyond the image and the word they are associated with . usually this is the case for very well known product , already in the market for year so this mean that they have been tested for a long time and passed the exam made by the customer . it is normal to be attracted by product associated to beautiful people or picture but we should not forget that we are going to spend money in order to have that product , so it ha to be worth it . sometimes the name of the brand is sufficient to sell a product because that name ha become famous somehow , so everything associated with that ha to be good . it happens to be real in some occasion but it could be also not always true . it is really difficult nowdays to be a smart customer beacuse we are made blind by so many aggressive and fascinating advertisement that drive u where they want u to go and they make u buying what they want . luckly we might have a budget so this can help u to keep under control the fever for buying the latest and the coolest product on the market , that this society is pushing higher and higher .
