i think it is more important for student to learn fact than it is for them to understand idea and concept . students need basic knowledge first . furthermore , student will use knoweldges more often rather than only idea or concept . finally , it will be easier to understand idea and concept when the student have enough knowledge and fact . first of all , student should be logical first . students are on the proccess of being mature and completed . humans will not become mature or knowledgeble if they do not learn fact . in my opinion , a person get sufficient fact an second , student will use knowledge more often rather than use idea or concept . for example , there are lot of assignment which the student are required to do . the most of assignment are about researching and analyzing something . even if a student who is lack of fact know many idea and concept , he will not get high mark . it is a very obvious fact . not only in the school , but also in the future when he get a job and work in the company without fact and knowledge , he will get into trouble . finally , when they have sufficient knowledge and fact , they can understand idea and concept easily . for instance , a student try to understand a concept of democracy . if he ha knowledge about democracy , it will be much easier to learn what is democracy . therefore , that learning fact is much more important for student rather than understanding idea and concept . it is due to the fact that student need knowledge first , that knowing fact will be much more usefull rather than understanding idea . also , when they have enough fact and knowledge , it is easy to understand concept and idea . i do not mean that idea and concept are unconditionally wrong . however , fact will be more usefull when the student complete their project or when they work in the society in the future .
