it is more imortant for student to unerstand idea and concept rather than concept it for them to learn fact . acording to my opinion it is more important for student to understand idea and concept , because idea to help the student to improve his skill and more knowledge about the subject , and it is more important to student to achieve his goal . the concept of reasonable subject is help the student to reach their goal . first of all i would like to give one example of this . when i am in the tenth class i did not well in the mathematics subject and i did not concentrate on the class very well , because of this lack of idea i did not well in the mathematics subject . one day my mathematics techer asked me do the problem , but i did not done that problem properly . then she wil teach subject very easily and giving the idea to me , and gave concept of the basic subject , then i easly understand the mathematics subject and i did very well in the exam . secondly i would like to tell you that is basic idea and concept very important to student , because if they did not know about the basic idea of the subject , they definately low knowledge about that subject . we did not understand the concept of the subject then we lose the knowledge of that subject , example poor student did not very well in their subject . finally , intelligent people ha always give the important to the idea and concept , and they very well known about the subject , those student whose idea are good they going to be goodperson . specially student are engineer they must include this idea . that way i am interested in this , and i also say that idea and concept are very important to the student .
