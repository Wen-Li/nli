in the present scenario , we see how the youth is changing in their behaviour . they are more advanced and infact many people opine that the youth in this generation is degrading . the fact that young people of this generation are more advanced doe not imply that they do not give enough time to helping community . i certainly not agree with the statement , ' young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their community ' . some of the supporting example are explained below . many young people form association which volunteer in social activity like serving the needy , building home for the old age and the orphan , bringing awareness about dreadful disease and conducting health campaign in the slum . they are the one who feel more responsible a a citizen of their country , in upliftment of their family . many young people give tutions to child to earn their living . this activity is in a way helping the child to learn more and be aware of the thing happening . and thereby helping the society a it is popularly known that ' today 's child are tomorrow 's citizen ' . so the youth today is helping out in producing good citizen . i want to support my opinion by stating another example . a political association , ` lok parithran ' ( which mean empowerment of the human ) , wa formed by young graduate in my country . they campaigned in many village and volunteered in many social activity . despite of hectic schedule , with several course to learn and several project to work on , the youth of this generation do spare time for thier community . the young student have that zealous to do something substantial which make them work effectively and spontaneously . they are the ` architect of the nation ' . they play an important role in building their community .
