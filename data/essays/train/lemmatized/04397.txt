to make a statement , that in twenty year there will be fewer car then are today , a person would need to be completely unaware of the current scenario in automobile develoment . hence , i strongly disagree with the above statement . the modern automotive story is one that is spending a lot of money on research and development of various new technology that will ensure the minimum use of petroleum a their energy source . although the current notion about the future of automobile is that once the supply of crude oil / petroleum is exhausted in the next 50 year , all these car will have to be taken off the road . the above reasoning may be true only if the current level of development is stopped right now . there are considerable number of newer strategy that have already been developed like ` fuel cell ' , ` battery powered vehicle ' to counter the loss of petroleum run vehicle . these technology are already in their testing phase of development , and prototype have already been run efficiently . due to the eco-friendly nature of these car , it is recieving considerable amount of support from various organization . this support ha contributed highly to the development of such alternate/hybrid technology vehicle . further more , looking at the growth of world population , number of people that will use any kind of conveyance to travel daily , easily surpasses all imagination . the growth of new world economy like brazil , india , china , is producing more number of rich people by the day . the average global spending power of people have increased over the year and one can easily consider that this growth will continue for the year to come . this spending power give people the advantage of choosing their own lifestyle - and an automobile is one of the most important part of a comfortable lifestlye . hence , i believe that the assumption , that there will be fewer car in use twenty year from now than there are today , is not justifiable . according to me , we may assume that the older car , technology will be surely be phased out by better alternative in the coming year . the number of car in use should definately go up than the current number a the number of people commuting daily and their need keep rising .
