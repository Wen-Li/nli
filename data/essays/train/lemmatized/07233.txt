i fully agree with the statement saying that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i will base my essay on my personal experience in order to consolidate my position . as a child , one 's normally forced to learn all the concept by heart . this applies to when we learned thing such a letter , number and color . however , this system only work while people are really young because when they grow up , the scenario change dramatically . when i began my first physics course , i wa used to learn everything that wa written on a paper or a text book . the problem appeared when i had to solve an exercise asking me to calculate the impact that gravity had on athlete . i wa unable to solve the problem with all the formula and theory that i had learned the night before . i wa completly blocked . i realised then , that understanding the idea could be much better for me than just learning fact . i forced myself to get the idea from the source i had and share the information found with my colleague and teacher . this ritual or studying method allowed me to have a better picture of the problem and find a better way to solve it . since then , i started forgeting about the traditional way of studying but beginning to understand where the main idea wa coming from . this way of learning is now helping me to solve the problem that i normally face when i 'm working . when my manager asks me to answer one of his question , he is not waiting for me to repeat everything that i 've learned from the school but for a quick response and solution . if you do n't know what the main idea are , you will not be able to interact with other professional . once again , my own experience make me confirm what i stated at the beginning . teachers and professor should take this new way of studying in order to teach their student accordingly . whatever they teach today could help their student in a future .
