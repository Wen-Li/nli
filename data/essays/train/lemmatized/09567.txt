to be realistic i guess it is true that young people enjoy life more than older people do . but that doe not mean if u get older you can no longer enjoy life , but instead your ability to enjoy life decrease . to be more specific your physical ability decrease a you get older putting u in more risk of getting sick thus spending more time at the hospital and seeing the doctor and i do not think any one enjoys that . moreover young people are more fit than older people thus are preferable to do thing old people can not do , like going skydiving going to place u have never been ther before like going to space , not having to follow a certain diet in other word eat whatever you want , thing old people can not do for health and physical reason . more , young people in a society are allowed to go clubing , go on date , flirt with the opposite sex , dress whatever you want . .. while a for an adult doing what i mentiond is bad for your image in the society . .. so by being an adult their are a lot of thing you can not experience in life for different reason . but a i mentioned being an adult doe not mean u can no longer enjoy life . you can still do in a different way for instance , a an adult you can enjoy life and have fun through spending time with your child and their child and by watching your child grow and raise him to become a successfull individual in the society he is living in , also by having a quite and peacful time enjoying a certain lovely view in nature such a watching the sun go down with your wife . but in my opinion now the activity young people do allows you to enjoy life have a taste of it more than the activity you do a an adult well at least thats what i think now maybe in the future when i get old and live life a an aduld i might change my mind but for now ill enjoy life in my way .
