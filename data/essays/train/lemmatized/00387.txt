car wa among the most significant invention in the 20th century . it ha greatly improved transportation and brought tremendous convenience to our life . however , today , some people start to believe that car usage is going to decline in the near future . nonsensical ? not really . i do agree that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year . i will now explain my point . first , twenty year later , it is very likely that other mean of transpotation , such a aeroplane and train , will take over car . today , travelling by air is already getting cheaper and faster . with all the budget airline emerging and the major air company expanding their rout , air transportation system is going to get more established and more convenient . the same is happening to train transporation sector . therefore , when this phenomenon continues to take place , car will soon lose their popularity , especially when coupled with the next problem . most people may also stop driving a the cost of driving continue to increase . by cost of driving , i am chiefly refering to the cost of petrol . petrol price is constantly on it rise today . twenty year later , petrol price may become so high that many people may not be able to afford using a car . hence , with many substitute available , such a air-traveling and train-traveling , it is logical to expect a decline in car usage twenty year down the road . last but not least , people are getting more and more environmentally conscious today . this consciousness is expected to discourage car usage in the future , so a to reduce air and noise pollution that most big city are experiencing now . people may switch to public transport for travelling within the city . some people may even choose to cycle instead of driving . in other word , a people get more educated and concern about the environment more , one can expect the see le car in the future . in essence , car may once be the favorite of man in term of traveling , but reality show that this may not be the case soon .
