i agree with the given statement . let u first define what `` fact '' mean . fact is one which is universallly accepted and which doe not have a solid reason for it belief . for e.g. a day ha 24 hour , or the month august wa named after augustus , and so on . now these are fact which are accepted by all . the standout difference between a fact and concept is : `` a fact is learned and a concept understood '' . to illustrate this let u take another example ; it is a well known `` fact '' that a gravitational force act on each object . but to understand the reason for this fact we net to understand the concept of gravity . on similar line it is a fact that the earth revolves round the sun . but why ? this can be answered after studying and understanding the idea and concept involved in the structure of the solar system . so we see that a fact is easier to locate and find but it is difficult to understand the reason for the said fact . therefore , a student should focus on the ideaology and conepts involved in the occurance of a fact . facts are the more obvious mundane thing , thing we come to know with time , but never get a chance to analsye the reason for them . so , a student should be provided with an opportunity to understand the concept involved , if any , behind the fact . moreover , the basic aim of study is not only teaching the fact but more importantly providing the understanding of those fact .
