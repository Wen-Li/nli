the question whether to have a broad knowledge of many acedemics subject or to specialise in one specific subject is a very arguable and can lead to many a heated discussion . in my opinion , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than to just have expertice in one . according to me , the practical value of a person increase when he know about various other subject apart from his major . this make him a lot more versatile and flexible . he can take care of a lot of thing without external assistance and thus can prove to be an asset . moreover , in today world , one ha to be aware of a lot of thing to make himself a well his family prosper . for example , a doctor by profession ha to have a basic knowledge of electricity and safely measure of electrical appliance to safely operate the appliance . if he doe not pay enough attention to this , and only be expert at his profession then he may unintentionally cause an accident . also for example , a chartered accountant need to know the basic of first aid in order to administer the same when the need arises . in the same way a contruction worker need to know the basic of taxation where he can save a dollar more . hence for a comfortable living in today world , one need to have a practical knowledge of a variety of subject . seeing in the practical aspect , this opinion is reflected in the corporate world also . we dont have a lot of expert of scientific or civil field . the reason for this is the amount of extra effort that they have to put in to become an expert . to further explain this , the time when a student start learning the content of a subject , i believe , he is not mature enough to decide whether this is what he actually want to expertise in . he is unaware of the other subject and possibility that lay ahead in them . for making a sound decision , one ha to spend some time in knowing the subject and then deciding . in we take this approach practically then , by the time a student get aquainted to all the subject his learning time ha lapsed biologically and he thus becomes jack of all but master of none . but there are a few exeptional one who do pursue specialised education and become specialist in their field . hence i feel that , the choice should afterall be of the student to decide between master or jack . but given a choice , i would prefer to be a jack rather than a master .
