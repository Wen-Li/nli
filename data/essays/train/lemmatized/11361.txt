young people now day have better thing in mind than to think of their community . some teenagers try to respect their community by following their rule and helping out while some others dont even care whats going on . but we ca n't really say that all young people are the same and that they think exacty the same . that 's like saying that every single adult is the same and that is certainly not true . sometimes it really depends by in what community young people are surrounded in . their interest 's would most likely change by the community . for example if it is helping out in the school community , young people would most likely be more interseted to get involved into it because it is something that they have to learn for future . because it involves them and their future life , they show more interest . rather than if it is about the community that they live in , they woulnd't really care , unless the people in the community are very close and the teenager are massivly pulled into it . now day so many other thing are happening in the world that involves young people all around they either have no time to even help out in the community or they are not willing to and think it 's a waste of time . there is so much to do for them now school whise and socially that they do n't even realize what 's going on in the community around them . but that again depends by how big or how involved they are in a community . technology ha changed so much in the live 's of young people that they either hardly have the time or interest to change or help the community that they are surrounded in . at the end it really depends by the interest of the young people to help in the community . they can change a lot in a community and some of them know that . not every young person think the same . some teenager have the will to help out in a community because they know that only young people can change it and some teenager dont even care and think that they have better thing to do . no one can reallly change that . the will ha to come from their own mind and that can only come if they want it .
