as we are today living in a more and more individualistic society , we may wonder whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their community . on my opinion , young people try to help their community since i still see a lot of example who are part of my relative and friend , but also thanks to the different travel i have had the opportunity to do . first , the fact that we live today in an individualistic society really matter . young people are looking for example and they reproduce what they see close to them . although they use to be very helpful and loyal to their community before , a lot of my friend and i still give time to help ours , by helping our family or working in different kind of association . we can not generalize but my different trip allowed me to see that young people from other place in the world do help their community . however , i think that the most important question is not whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their community but do those community give time to helping young people ? young people are often lost in our modern world . moreover , they are looking for example and hero but also for value and education . communities have changed and do no always perpetuate their value to young people . i have some family in vietnam ; they explained me that parent take care of their child when they are young but when the parent get old it is the child 's turn to take care of their parent . in conclusion , if we want young people nowadays to give more time to their community , we have to make them understand the importance of helping their community , but community also have to give time to helping youmg people .
