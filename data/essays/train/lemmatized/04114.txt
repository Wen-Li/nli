in order to understand something student should have a basic idea about it . i agree with the statement that it is more significant for the student to understand idea and conept because in order for having a vast knowledge about any thing we should have a idea or concept which can be applied later in the practical life . one reason for my belief is that in order to have a overall knowledge about any equipment or any subject , it take time therefore student should learn idea and concept . suppose we take a case of a person who want to become a pilot , so inorder to become a pilot , he should have to understand idea and concept about the various mechanism in the aeroplane instead of driving it . he can drive it better if he can have a better understanding about the concept and idea then he can apply these in driving the aeroplane . second reason for my belief is that inorder for the accurate knowledge for the subject it is better for the student to have a clear understanding about idea in their class room because i feel that for a flawless knowledge we should have our concept cleared in classroom . suppose a student want to work on a computer aided machine which is a very expensive machine and quite vulnerable to fault if not handled properly , then in these case without having a knowledge of concept and idea to handle it , student can cause a problem to the machine resulting in failure . finally , i feel that in the student life there are too much concept which are to learn , they had le time to complete their subject syllabus , therefore they should firstly complete the course in their school otherwise le time will harm their academic career . however for the proper study of the a subject , student should have a hand to hand knowledge of fact also these will help in acquiring profound knowlege of the subject . in conclusion , i agree with the statement that the student should understand idea and concept which will be more benefical for them .
