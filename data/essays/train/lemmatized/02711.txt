i have experiemced a situation many time when i wa disappointed by the actual usefullness of a productb compared to the advertisement on the television . most advertisement truly make product seem much better than they really are . we see many kind of advertisement on almost every channnel on television , such a laundry soap which make dirty laundry exreamly white or jerm killing spray which killes all the jerms in three second . almost all product have catchy phrase and a song that go with it which make u want to try it at least once . in japan , tv advertisement play a big part in the society . they have ring tone of a particular advertisement song that we can download or t-shirt that have a character of a specific character of a product . they are part of our life , and we are often unaware that we are actually advertising those product . because television advertisement play a huge part in japan , people who make the advertisement end up focusing on the `` side effect '' rather than the actual usefullness of affection of a product . also , the company which make advertisement focus more on the `` looking '' of the product than of the actual taste of the usefullness of the product or a dish , because their job is to gather people ' attention a much a possible . when advertising something , it is important to make sure that it look good and attractive . but we always have to be aware that they are sometimes over exaggerating .
