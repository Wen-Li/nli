i disagree with the point made above that having knowledge of all the thing is better compared to having the knowledge of one specific field . as it is said it is better to be the master of one thing rather than jack of all trade . i have different resons for counteract it . take example for the following case : 1. if the above fact would have been true then in university there would be no any specialization of any subject and all the student would opt for all the subjects. but in the current sceniro this is not applicable in any part of the world which itself is a evidence of the effectiveness of the above logic . 2. take the example in the medicine field. a time go on new and new disease is affecting the mankind. in this situation only the person who ha experienced in the corresponding field can go for the research for the curement for that disease by the mean of biotechnology and will ultimately land up with some specific kind of solution . 3. take the example of the engineering field. how can we suppose to think that a person who ha no experince in civil and in construction will be able to make a dam for the society . if he will go for this perpose the govt. will itself not allow that person to build it. even if by any mean he is able to penetrate through all the hurdle then in that situation he can not give the guarntee about the dam which he built . so taking the above example and fact one could easily conclude that for the betterment of society one ha to undergo specialization which itself lead to the betterment for himself .
