i agree with that idea but not at all because i have a personal opinion about what is going to happen with car in the future . it is obvious that petrol is going to disappear in the next twenty year so the human race ha to find other source of energy that can suplies this petrol . the big car company are developing others way to make a car without petrol but that is not very serious because they are going to continue making petrol car until the moment it will disappear . so in my opinion we are going to have car for the next twenty year but the number of them will go down because nowadays people is care about the enviroment and every day we prefer to go by bike or using the public transport before using the car . that 's why i agree with the idea that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . but i am not sure that this is going to happen because young people like my case , we were waiting for have a car since we were child . i care about the enviroment but i want to have a car when i get the licence . this is only one of the reason why i am not sure that in twenty yeras there will be fewer car . on one hand people every year is getting more concerned about the enviroment , ecology , nature etc but on the other hand everybody want to have a car . we live on a crazy world and anybody is sure about what is going to happen from here to the next twenty year because everyone is looking for it 's own interet . on conclusion , if everbody work together we can make that possible .
