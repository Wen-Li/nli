i do agree with this statement , because i think it is easier to use something you learned in your everyday life if you did understand the idea or the concepept of what you learnd . for example if you learn something in physics , like electricity , you learn these formula and you can for example say , how high the voltage is or something like that but if you are not understanding what you are doing you ca n't keep that in mind . that 's the way it is with me , i just can remember stuff i really understood . i am a trained vet nurse and i learned a lot about so many different type of animal but you never can help them fighting their deseases if you are not understanding the whole system of a body . and it doe n't help you just to learn it you have to understand it . the understanding of a concept give you also the possibility to transfer thing you learnd for something special to other thing happening in your life . like in maths if you are not just learning that fact to use it in school you can use it in your home for example to reorganize your room in a better way by using formula you learnd . i think the best example to see how this work are kid . you tell them that the fire is hot , so that is a fact . and they know the fact that the fire is hot but they ca n't understand what hot mean . so in most case the kid touch the fire and then they know what is meant when there parent say `` it is hot '' . and they can transfer it to every other thing in there everyday life like the oven . if their mother say it is hot , they do n't dare to touch it because they understood what is the meaning of hot . so in the end i think it is always better to understand the idea of what you are learning , because just in that case it is easier for you to use it in your life and it is so much easier to keep it in mind .
