recent day my parent often ask me , `` so , what do you want to study in an university ? '' whenever this question stand in front of me , i ca n't even say a ward to answer it , but instead just stand there deligently and deeply considering what i really want to learn for endless time . in some of the university , they do n't ask to choose major but they give an oppotunity for student to take any subject they want to . however i do n't want belong to it . i personally think that the knowing and specializing in one specific subject is much important because there are a lot of disadvantage of trying to have broad knowldege of many academic subject . firstly , it is impossible to put all knowledge in the world in people 's small brain in such a short amount of life that we have given . human 's history is surprisingly long , and every new fact and information were found by people at that time . besides information and knowledge are always changing and increasing a time pass by . as a result , the sum of those knowledge , which were found and will be found , are a lot and anybody ca n't input them in the brain le than a decade we got . furthermore , there are a lot of people who ca n't get job that they expect and become a unemployment . one of the reason of this is because they have spread their view too wide and have n't focused on what they can really good at . even though they have broad knowledge , but it 'll be useless when it come to reality since when people are getting job , they have to specialize what the specific job they work for . to conclude , i believe that specializign in one specific subject is considerabely essential for people 's life since knowing a much a they can on many academic subject is impossible . nobody is good at every subject , however it is true that everybody ha certain subject that they can do better than others do .
