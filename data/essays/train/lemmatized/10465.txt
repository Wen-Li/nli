nowadays it is often mentioned that we are using up our natural resource and that there will be very few resource of fuel in a few decade . as the usable amount fuel will be getting le the the cost will get higher . even today for a few year gas and fuel price have gone very high . as a result of these it is claimed by some of the researcher that there will be fewer car in twenty year time . though i do not agree with this idea , i even think that there will be more car in twenty year . there are two reason that i strongly claim . first reason of the fact that there will not be fewer car in use in twenty year is the alternative energy source . as engineer we predict that alternative energy source will be in use in ten year time like sun and hydrogen energy . there are really important research on the use of these energy for car . even in turkey there are more than 40 car using sun energy built so far . moreover car using hydrogen energy ha already been built but still being worked on . when we come over this energy problem , in other word make the last car product working with alternative energy there will certainly be an increse in the number car in use . the second reason is that in twenty year there will still be plenty of petrol that can be used ( may be more expensive ) . and if we consider the populaion growth and the increase of wealth we can conclude that in twenty year there will more people using car , even one family will have four or five car ! as a result the claim that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year is completely wrong from the point of view that i have here . as an engineer i can say that car in use will increase day by day
