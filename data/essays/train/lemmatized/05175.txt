today , the population of the world is increasing rapidly . so that , some indivisual need such a house and car are increasing depends on this process . in twenty year , the increment of dwelling number in city will continue at the same speed rate but i can not make the same prediction for the number of car on the world . according to me , the number of car will be le than today in the future . because i have most of reason to support my idea . todays , the goverments noticed the importance of railway in respect to transportation system at the region and city . in transportation policy , the mass transportation is preferred by most of the country . this is the big factor of decreasing the car number most of people are dying at the traffic accident nowadays . so , people are preferring mass transportation facility such a plain , train , bus etc. when travelling . because these vehicle are more comportable , cheaper and safer than the car . in the future , depending on the high population at the city , commuting will take more and more time for people by car by virtue of high traffic density on the road . so the fast transportation advantage of car will be disappear . \ the fuel price will be very expensive . for high travel cost , everybody will use bus and train for going to their job or home . in conclusion , in the future , different and single vehicle will be replaced on the road inside the city instead of big car . because of parking problem , the big car will be a freight on the citizen who live at the city .
