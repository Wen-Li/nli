every one of the people around the world belong to a spicific community . and he or she thus ha different commitment towards his or her community . we are part of our community and can not detach from it or give it up . all the three level of age child , young , adult , and old should help thier community a much a they can do . when we take a certain stage like young , we can notice that they really do not give a lot or even enough time for serving their community . and i think this is arised from several reason including that those young are only concerned with thier own pleasure and entertaintments . in which they spent a lot of money to ride a new car or to buy a new expensive mobile phone or new cloth or to even gain a new pritty girlfriend . thier lifstyle is some what changed , they dont ever think of other inneed people to help them , or cleaning thier nighberhood , or fixing some broken public place or seat , or teaching childerin , or preventing some bad habit like smoking and taking drug and drinking alcohol . non of that could be done from them . one of other reason include that all the people inside the community are apart from each other . in which parent do not teach , learn or arise thier childerin of loving other people and they arise them for being a speciall or unique person . person who gain money and spent it on his or her self . in conclusion these day are really hard on our community and we have to do something to solve this problem . and that can only be done by increasing the education of loving our community . and help any person who need that . and every one who refuse must be punished .
