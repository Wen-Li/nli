it would be really difficult not to agree with this statement . everyone of u ha , at least one time in his or her life , experienced a supermarket and bought something from it . it would be hardly the case not to have realized that a great part of the good that we took home from that supermarket , showed to be much le satisfying or valuable than what we had been presented by advertisement . it would be too naive to ask ourselves why it happens . we all know the answer : producing company stimulate and exploit our wish and desire , about buying something nice , tastful or appealing , in order to elevate the selling figure and earn more . instinctively , one could say that it 's an immoral behaviour and that it could also be defined a heavily cheating . the interesting fact , though , is that we perfectly know that it will happen and we are conscious what we will face , once confronted with the reality of the product we would buy . it 's a sort of a theatral play , where every carachter ha it place and role : the producing company know that they will boost the quality of their product in the advertisement , we know that we will have to reduce by half our expectation on the product we buy . so much for the raw , actual situation . but doe this acknowledgement make any difference about the morality of this `` play '' ? i do n't think so . i consider such a behaviour , by the producing company , higly deprecable and , at least , a-moral , if not immoral . profit ha the upper hand over trustfulness , and that should n't happen . but i consider myself pragmatic enough to live up with it .
