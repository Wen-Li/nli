now day it is easy to travel to any country and do not get lost . drictions these day are more clear than it used to be in the old day , or let 's say it is not a confusing a it wa in the old day . you can travel to any where in this world by yourself or with anybody you know without having to have a tour guide to help you see your way . sometimes it is more fun to go by yourself and try to explore the country you are in , if you get lost you will find your way out , may be after a long time or after having a hard time , but the fun thing is to have the adventure of getting lost , and the adventure of telling the story afterwards . getting lost will sometimes help you to know more about the country , i am not trying to say that traveling in to a country without a tour guide will be good advanture by getting lost but , it is fun in one way or another . having a tour is sometimes a great idea in my opinion . the tour guide will guide you and show you the best place in the country you traveled to , such a the hestoric place , ancient cite , church , house , resturants , and hotel . all this will come with great explenation about the past and the present of every place . traveling with a group is fun too , you can meet new people from diffirrent place around the world and it is a great idea to make friend over sea and to know more about thier culters and tradition . i believe it will be more fun if you travel alone or with some one you know and spend time together exploring the country you traveld to , besides it will be expensive to get a tour guied . the tour guide may not understands the languge you speaking and you may not understand him , some time you will have some diffecaulties trying to get the gourp together to start your tour , some people are not ready or busy doing something and other problem that may occur too . if i ever want to travel i will chose to travel with out a tour guide .
