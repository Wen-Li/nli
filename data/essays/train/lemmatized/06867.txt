i agree with that statement to a certain point . successful people are wealthy in most case , so they probably have the money to try new thing or even take risk . for example , if you take a look at the business world , you are able to find case where big business put a new article on the market , even though they are not sure if that product will sell well . that 's called taking a risk . the people behind the big business have the money to make and solve mistake without having to suffer . they have the urge do create something new and please more costumer with their product . if they kept doing what they already know how to do well , they would probably get bored . it 's in the human nature to try out stuff . human are very interested in that . it 's a kind of feeling that they have inside , almost like an instinct . on the other hand , i know for a fact , that there are also incident , where successful people just do n't want to come out of their shell . they feel comfortable with what they are doing because they do it over and over again . they also have the knowledge and do n't really feel the urge to put themselves in a situation of risk . risk can have bad consequence and could ruin that person 's life . it may lead that person to a break-down and ruin everything he already accomplished . some people are just not ready to put themselves in situation that contain risk . all in all , i think that it can be healthy to put yourself in a situation of risk , because there are time that this might make you stronger or even wiser . it is proven that people in risk situation are under tension . tension make you work harder and give you the opportunity to accomplish more . at the end , i have to admit that the statement ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well` , can be supported or not , whether it is right or wrong .
