some people think that it more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . i think thats something true . i think knowing the main idea about something is very important . it is useless knowing the fact without knowing the idea or the concept . having the knowledge of something is different . understanding the main point of thing and getting the concept of them will get you to a point where they will be usable when you need them . having the idea of something make that information usefull and give it a value . because it mean that something which ha been learned , but not just taken in memory because of your teacher say you have to . getting the concept of something will be better because if the teacher asks you something about it and if you have only improved the result or the fact of it , it is quiate impossible for you to answer the question . for example if you know the fact that the light will be on when you push the button , thats ok . but if the teacher asks you why , it 's useless knowing the fact . if you would have improved the main idea of light than it wont be a problem for you . never the le , having the knowledge of something will show you the fact eather way . it is very important for you to understand the concept or the idea of something . if you understand it , that mean you can also understand the fact and the solution of it . for example , if you know how the light work that mean the you can also permit the fact . if you take a shower with a hair drier which is already on , it likely for you to burn . its all about knowing the main idea and getting the concept of it . in conclusion , understanding idea and conceps is far better than learning fact because knowing the main idea is very important and having the idea of something will show you the fact anyway . at school , the teacher should try to make clear the idea but not only the fact to student .
