i like listen to my father 's story about his friend . he ha own company and succeed , but i think his personality is kind of strange , in other word , he is an adventourous person . he like to go different place and buy new thing . i thought he is a just rich person and waste his money for fun ; however , my thought wa wrong . he is experiencing new thing and planning what is next his project . from my experience , i believe that successful people try new thing and take risk . trying new thing give new idea while they are doing . if people don not try new thing , they can not have creative or intersting idea . i think that from several experience we can extend our knowledege and perspective wildly . successful people go to a lot of different place and experince ; therefore , they can inspire new idea . taking risk might be big damege , but from risk , people can learn what is a problem or weakness . somethimes people need to fail from something because they can notice what is it wrong , but if they keep their rotuine and not try anything , they even can not see new solution or idea . for example , reserching cost a large amount of money , especially abroad , but this can be big asset after they success . so , people should not to afraid so much to take risk . successful people have interesting personality . if people are doing the same thing , their brain would be hard and can not see other possiblities like stubborn . in conclusion , i think that when people are success , they are interesting and intelligent people because of their challenge : trying new thing , not being afraid of taking risk . so , i think that thier careea reflects their personality like enjoyable and rich personality .
