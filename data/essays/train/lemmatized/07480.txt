i think that nowdays there few young people that spend some of their time to helping someone else . so , i can say that i am agree with this statement . i do not believe that young people know that wrong . in fact i think that is the society that grows the young people . everyday i see this lack of helpful in different situation . in order to they think only to theirself . there is not helpful and this is possible to view in our family , or in our community . when there is need to do something , young peolpe do not think . young people do not to be able to help their friend . when there is a difficulty in a community all the member try to resolve the situation but nowdays also the adult try it . young people spend a lot of time to play with their friend , to study , but always alone . an example to explain what that i say is this . thinking about at the bus stop , there is an ancient woman that ha some difficults to take the bus . near to her there is a young boy that see her but doe n't help she to take the bus . indifference nowdays is at the basis of our society , and this is very afraid . there is n't comunication in our society : internet , the tv , ha modicated our maind and all seem to feel a a fiction . return on the principies that must stay at the basis of a good society is very important . nowdays also in our family we can see these situation of no helping . helpful should return at the basis of our life because it is better to give that recive . society must changed for a better future .
