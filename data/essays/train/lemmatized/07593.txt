life could be enjoyed in different way taking in consideration not only the age of the person , but also his interest , physical capacity and purchasing power . it is clear that young and older people usually do different kind of activity , but to set a value and compare the grade of joyness of each of them is not serious . a young person could be enjoying life a much a an older peson doe , doing different thing and knowing that if they change role , they will be not enjoying at all . young people usually belief that they enjoy life a much a anyone else . they are in their plenty physical condition , they are willing to take risk or they usually do not have responsibility such a a family to maintain or business to run . nevertheless , they still have not enough experience and money to spend . for example , a young person could have the time to spend one month in italy on vacation , meet a lot of woman and have a lot of fun but he would live with a limit budget , perhaps working to eat and party . in the contrary , older people is commonly looked a person who do not enjoy life at all . but those comment are wrong . older people have experienced different situation , have visited many place , have married and usually have saved money . hence , older people usually know exactly what they like and go for it . for example , an older person could travel to italy on vacation , but just for one week to venice , with his lovely wife to enjoy good food and wine and do sightseeing . the point is that we can not say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . a more serious way of thinking is to compare the grade of joyness that the same person had in his youth with the one he ha in his older year . in that way we could have a more accurate answer , although i believe that life is enjoyable at any age , always .
