i agree with the statement that it is important for student to understand idea and concept instead learning fact . as i am a student , i interest in experience something and learning from experience many thing . such a for history study , i go to europe and look around real palace and building and learn about renaissance and feel alive history . it is very exciting way to learn , however , sometimes i ca n't understand some part . from fact , we can get alive information and interestig thing but sometimes we ca n't catch what we want . as we travel europe for history study , we should have lot of background kowledge for know about that . if we do n't have any idea or concept about art work , we ca n't understand art work during renaissnace period . and sometimes fact make exception . lots of experiment that done from many scientist make exception . of course it could be new invention , however , the fact can lead scientist wrong way to learn about something . if some scientist did wrong lab and they beileve that they are on right way . however , it is wrong result . it make confusing when other people access to that idea . they will confuse at which one is right . it is also same at solve the math problem . so i think idea and concept are always be the basic . when we finish studying basic we can catch something fast and right way , and even though we faced with exception , we can prove it easily . for those reason , i prefer that understand basic such a ieas first , then later learning fact . although i like to learn fact and enjoy the fact however , i usually try to learn basic first . and it is really important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact .
