where i live , in japan , some people think that young people today spend a plenty of time to help their community . i , however , agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community for the following two reason . first of all , young people become to use their time for other activity . today , there are more attractive toy and instrument than before . for example , there are many and many game and we can use internet now . in japan , young people often spend thier time on playing game at thier home , a game-center . and we can often see young people playing portable game even in the train , bus or at school . in addition , they usually use internet very much both by thier personal computer and internet cafe . so , young people are very busy , a they are earnest in spending their time in above activity . in addtion , they become to lose ability to have relation with other person . second , community , thierselves , become to disapper . we can live a life by ourselves more easily than before . for example , in the past , we had to grow someting and share many thing . but now , we have almost thing to live in our house . so , now , we tend not to need other people help and community help . therefore , i strongly agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
