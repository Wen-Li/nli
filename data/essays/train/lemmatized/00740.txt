in general , people keep much knowledge along their study and are able to use these knowledge in the life . while some people prefer to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject other prefer the reversed situation of the previous statement . in my opinion , specializing in one specific subject is better than having knowledge of many academic subject . firstly , i prefer specialization in one specific subject because it will allow me to improve my skill in this specialization . for example , i prefer to study all time in n only one field to be able to study in depth all the phenomenon which are in this feild . also , it will permit me to be an expert of my specialization . secondly , it is better to do a specialization because i will permit me to be well organized . for instance , my schedule of study will not be shared into many different academic subject . then , i could be relax to manage my time to do an excellent work . on contrary , having broad knowledge of many academic subject is not a good way because a person who doe it will not have time to study in depth all these subject . as an example , someone who want to study in the same time physic , philosophy , theology and law will not be able to know deeply each of these subject . also , it is wrong to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because i will not have enough time to do all my work accuretly . such a person who ha to submit within a tiny time eight or ten tremendous work , it will be very difficult for him to do good work and submit work on time . in sum , having broad knowledge of many academic subject ha disadvantage and specializing in one specific subject ha advantage . as far a i 'm concerned , it is better to specialize in one subject . people should specialize in one specific subject in their study .
