i do not agree or disagree with this particular statement becuase it totally depends on the idea that you have when you want to travel and also where you wish to go . for me , when you 're younger you always looking for something new even if it get a little too risky and sometimes that risk you are willing to take is the main attraction of the whole trip . if i want to know a city and if i have the time to do it the best way to explore every interesting corner , at least for me , is going directly to them instead of waiting for our turn in the tour route for that place . also , knowing people of the place is much better than spend all day with other you dont like in the bus . i think is really a good expierence to be surrounded by peolpe with different culture because you realize that we 're not so different in many way it 's only matter of social belief the way we react in every situation of our life . the best thing of a group leaded by a tour guide is the time you save when someone who know everything about the place you have visited is in your side . i mean you dont have to worry for the food , the hotel or the place you 'll use to rest , the place you have to go and all those thing you have to know about the people , their languaje and their costums . maybe a group of friend on a trip can be the better way to travel to a new land for me and even if a tour guide is leadding u because im not really looking to get lost in a city i dont even know , at least not for now or any soon .
