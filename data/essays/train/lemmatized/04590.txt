in the last year this topic became very actualy in my country . the last university reform change a lot of thing in university career . we are going to a world that always want student more and more specialized and this reform go in this way . i think that we need a right rate of both subject . a specific subject solely is not a good thing . i think that because in my field , i study engeneer , tecnology change very fast and it is possible you likely specialized yourself in a subject that only 2 year later is preistoric . in other way a broad knowledge solely is too much out of world for student , which generally want to '' take by hand '' what they have just seen into book . i think university must do more broad knowledge of many subject than specific one . i think that knowledge of many subject help student in the early age of university to choose their way . they can help their to choose their major and what they want to do in their life about work . the specific subject , after a good choosen , can help student to know good part of real situation of tecnology at the moment when they want to go in work world . i think that the really important thing is how a student challenge his school problem . i think that give yourself a good preparetion is the best thing to do . it is very important to have a good mind to challenge problem of every nature in school like in life . if you have the right '' forma mentis '' ( way of mind ) all thing are more easy .
