someone say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , well , i agree with this statement . thinking about twenty year ago , for example , we can find out how young people really cared about their community and the society a a whole . the issue of homeless , poor family and enviroment had a central role in debacts and conference , and parent thought their child how to be responsible for public good and other people 's thing . the fact that government decided the end of the compulsory navy service , giving young men the chance to choose wheter going in the navy or doing something useful for the community , clearly is an evidence of young people 's deeper social committment . nowadays thing have changed , if we made a survey we would find out that only few young people are engaged in social activity or take care of their community . have people became more selffish ? do person ignore the problem affecting their community , such poverty , violence and drug ? i do n't think thing are following this pattern . i think nowadays life take all our freetime and prevent u to take on social activity , actually because we lack the time to do it . i am speaking a a young person : i go to university , where paper and assignment take me a great time to be done , moreover i need to work in order to pay the college 's fee . i have no time left in my day to help my community . the greatest thing i can do is to donate to the church part of my saving , and i think i feel compelled to do this because i have n't the chance to do real activity , for the reason i mentioned before . in my opinion all the student face the same difficulty i do , they are not selfish and they really would like to help other people , but their daily life make it difficult . for example a friend of mine , who study medical science and spends all his time at university , decided last christmas , together with his girlfriend , to adopt a child living in the third world . the child is n't living with them , they just provide him money for his education and growth , but this is an example of the existing committment on social problem . i think it is our society , our way of living , that prevent u from doing our best for the others , not the selfishness of our heart . if young people had more freetime , if it wa n't necessary to study hard and do their best at work to have just a little salary , people would be happy to help their community . my grandfather sayed : ^ give a smile and you will be happyer , the smile will come back in your heart ^ i think it is true , and in conclusion i think people are not more selfish than they were in the past , they only need to find a new way of li nowadays young are usually self concerned and focus their life on friend , school and amusement forgetting the importance of a social help . this is true ax
