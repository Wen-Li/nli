knowing everything is what make people intellectually perfect ! every human being look forward to this . but the fact that know body ever fully got to that point , can bring doubt on the possibility of this issue . for some people knowing everything is what they live for . for others limitation to one academic subject is preferable . on one hand , some people , might get stubborn , and look forword to pas their life trying to answer their never ending question . they get to a certain point , where they will find themselves unsatisfied with what they already know , because they will find themselves knowing a bit of everything . consequently , they will continue their never ending research , and live a stressfull life worrying about getting able to reach the point of perfection . on the other hand , other people , find themselves absolutely satisfied and proud with the academic subject that they mastered perfectely . rather , then wasting time trying to learn about many academic , they can become a reference for one specific academic subject that they mastered entirely . this part of the population , will be able to invest it life to it full , because they will not have to live anxiety , they will instead build their social life and be in the main time successful in their professional life . they will , furthermore by having this sense of proudness , be more confident in themselves then a person that work extremely hard but is just never satisfied with what he / she ha accomplished . in conclusion , knowing everything , can not be reachable , at least not for the moment . life is too short we better live it to it full , and be proud of ourselves by mastering one specific subject completely and get time in the main time to build memory to remember in the futur .
