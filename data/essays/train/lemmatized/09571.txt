for student what is important ? question which is echoing globally , it not just the matter of any country or a continent . this issue is a global concern for parent , teacher , policy makersand almost all of u . i , personally feel that understanding idea and concept should be the primary task of the student . once you are able to get the idea and concept behind a event or a issue or a problem , you can easily correlate all the fact , a fact are always the derivative of concept lying behind . for example , if newton would have also thought in the way of learning fact only , then he would n't have worked on gravitation , instead he would have ate that apple that day and could have slept under that tree . but his jest for understanding idea and concept , and gave u law of gravitation , and many more discoverieswhich in turn led to the growth of technology , it ha increased in turnthe horizon of thinking capability of the human brain , which led u to more discovery . understanding the basic , make one clear about the topic and help you better understand the fact and one can easily understand the problem and and with it help can develop further solution to some other problem . what , if we had not studied about the atmosphere , would we have been able to protect ourselves from nature 's fury . had we able to fight hte disease ? the answer is big no . what is required for that is indepth knowledge of the subject not the surface reading . so , this is , what the attitude of the student must be , instead of just mugging up the fact , they should think more about developing that fact further . how a new fact can be generated form that ? . this not only will merely lead to the their growth and successbut will be the source for the success of society and infact world a a whole and will be future inspiration for the generation to come
