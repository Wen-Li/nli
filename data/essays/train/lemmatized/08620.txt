the cycle of life is amazing . a human is born weak and than get to the zenith of his strength at one point than go back to being weak a he approach the end of his life . yet ask yourself this ? when doe a person enjoy life the most ? in my humble opinion enjoying life mean to have health , time in your life and the passion to learn which is what most old people lack . that is why young people enjoy life more than old people do . in order to enjoy life you need to have a great health . most young people that . they are strong and often do not suffer from many disease a old people do . young people can jump scream and dance whenever they are happy . they are able to respond to their exitement through physical action . however if an old person get exited it 's more likely for him to get a heart attack . it is very rare to see an old person able to jump up and down when exited . it 's said that life is like a toilet paper . the sooner it get to the end the faster it roll . often do we hear old people talking about death a if it became a new friend they are ready to be escorted with a they leave the ballroom of life . old people put the idea that they do not have any more time in their hand wich make them think there is nothing to be happy about . when i ask my grandma `` come up the stair with me so we can watch the sunset '' she would answer '' no my dear , it 's too late for me to do that . it 's your time now . you go by yourself and enjoy it while you can . '' . my grandma just missed out the fun of gazing into the sunset because she thought that the stair would kill her . young people dont worry about time . as far a they are concerned they should enjoy life while they still can ! to me learning is one of the most excitting activity i enjoy . and when i say learning i mean learning from life . like having the suspence and wondering what will happen next . or where your life is going to take you . experiencing that the knowledge you know today is different from the knowledge you know tomorrow . old people will miss out on that excitting feeling because when they think about their future , atomatically a picture of a grave load up in their mind . they say they have nothing to learn because they are in the final statges of life . therefore they lack the passion to learn . if you do n't have the will to learn than you will not learn . in conclusion , this doe n't mean that all old people are miserable . it 's really how the individual defines the phrase `` enjoying life '' . to me if you do not have health , time and passion for learning i do n't believe you will be able to enjoy life .
