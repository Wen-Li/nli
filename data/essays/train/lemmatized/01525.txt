personally , i preffer to travel without a tour guide , tour travel are regularly done by a schedule , it ha it own agenda and i preffer to take my time in thing that in thing that interest me the most . the best way for me is use a map , which i found very easy to use , and before going out on the first day do an itinerary of thing you are more interesting in seeing or doing . for example i wa in paris last summer with my girlfriend , we bought a map of the city and we researched on the internet the most interesting place in paris , we searched each site on the map and did a 3 day route of what we wanted to do , all the place of those area we wanted to visit and in the end we still had a lot of time to enjoy more place than we tought . this way you dont have to be stuck in place you might get boring . when i got home i showed all the picture to my father of all the place we went , because he went to the same city 2 year ago , with a tour guide and he said they didnt even visited 50 % of the place we visited without the tourist guide . i recommend tourist guide trip for older people who have never visited a city or for teenager who want to know more about the culture of the place . traveling on your own help you grow a a person , help you not to depend on others , help you to be more independent and also to discover thing for yourself . tourist guide may think what place are better for your learning and what are the most important place of each city , but in the end i preffer to travel alone .
