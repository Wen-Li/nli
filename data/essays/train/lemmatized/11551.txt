debates on wherether it is more important for student to understand idea and concept versus simply learning the fact are very common . comprehending and understanding the concept and idea is obvioulsy more important than simply learning the fact . there are many reason why understanding idea and concept is more important that learning fact . if a student is only memorizing fact they will not understand why the answere or the outcome wa what it wa . the student attend school to gain knowlage not to memorize fact . if they are merley learning the fact they are being robber of their education . when the student leaf the class they should be able to answere why something happend the way it did not just know that it happened . furthermore , the tool the student recinves by understanting idea and concept are much more valuale than the one he or she will learn by only memorizing fact . by understanding concept the student will be able to apply them to different stituations and come to other conclusion . if a student understantds that something happens because of some reason they can answere more question and know more about the subject that those who only know the fact . although in most occasion it is easier to learn the fact instead of understanding the concept in the long run understanding the concept is more valuable . the student that understands the concept will be able to answere more question on the subject and be over all more knowlegable on the topic . the student that simply memorized the fact will eventually forget them and will have gaind nothing at all .
