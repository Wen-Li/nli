in these year there are le partecipation from the young people to help their community . i am one of the young people nowadays and i agree that young people take care a very short time to helping their community , but i understand also the reason because they do it . the first reason is that with this new global world with a lot of videogames , football or music program , bring the young people to spent a very long time to play videogames , or to play some sport , instead of to help their community . a second reason is that the information about community in all town is very small and much of young people do n't know what is it a communitie . therefore , young people do n't give time to helping community because they do n't know the existence of these community . a last reason is that in these year life is very fast and if young people study sever hour every day for the school and in free time they play a sport to relax them , they have no time to help their community . from these reason is clear my opinion . i agree that young people spent no time to help their community and spent a lot of time in different and useles thing . but i am also a young people and i understand their behaviour , because they live in a very fast world with many television and videogames and if they study much of their free time , like me , they ca n't give enough time to helping their community . however , if they have a lot of free time they should to help their community because is a very good way to spent their time .
