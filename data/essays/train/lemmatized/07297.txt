i disagree with this point of view . nowadays with the fast development in medical field , social environment and the advanced concept towards the good old day , more and more older people are enjoying the pleasure of the daily life and the proportion of older one keep on rising in recent year . older people a well a young people are enjoying the improving life . first , i think older people have more leisure than young people . young people have to struggling to get enough money to maintain a life in the daytime and go on to study in the night college and other training system , which provide them with the technics necessary for their work . in contrast to them , old people do n't need to go to the company everyday to strive for money due to the fund supplied by the government and they do n't need to be punished by boss for not finishing the work properly . what they need to do is just to lie in the sofa , watching tv or go to meet the former companion and call on at friend ' house . what a wonderful life ! second , older people gain happiness by thinking about what they have acheived during the adult time . but the young have no time to consider this and they are experiencing failure everyday . therefore , they are surrounded by pain , sorrow and any ohther unpleasant thing , which constantly appear . the older have no risk to compete with others , leaving the young people to be engaged in the competitive world . last but not least , the old one enjoying the care given by their son or duaghters . in china , every child , when growing up , must commit the responsibility to look after their parent . their child will bring money , fruit or other wonderful thing to the old but they themselves have to spend time teaching their own little chdren . generally older people enjoy almost everything given in the old day . as the whole environment is improving rapidly , more and more older people will realize what an excellent life we have received .
