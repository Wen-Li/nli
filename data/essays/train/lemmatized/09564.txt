having a lot of knowledge could lead one to not know a lot about anything . if this is true , many would not be able to specialize on anything due to the fact they do not know enough about a subject , to have a job or specialize in it . thus in my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject , in order to suceed in and perfect the subject which one is studying . a doctor , need to focus on the medical aspect of it career in other to excel on it . if a doctor were to study many subject at the same time , he or she would get distracted from it main specialization which is saving life or working in a hospital . ofcourse , the doctor should know a bit about english , grammar , and other subject esential to live , but the doctor should not focus entirely on those subject , because they are not a important a a biology class can be . if someone specializes in one specific subject and give all it attention to it , one will have greater possibilites of excelling and learning about the subject . for example , in my school we use to have 13 course per semester , and people did not have time to focus on any single subject a instensively a they should or wanted to , because it wa too muh work . after a while , the school changed it policy and decieded to cut down the course to 5 , in which people could take math , science and spanish and other two course of their choice . students started to pull up their grade because it wa easier to focus on the subject one liked and specialize on the subject that wa related to the career one wanted to pursue later on in life , for example people would take 2 class of math , and were able to focus and specialize in math for the future of their bussiness career . although it is good to know about many subject , in my opinion it is imposible to learn and really excell on them while one is studying many different subject . in that case student are learning the esential thing about the subject , but are not taking the time in any of them to specialize and pronfundize their knowledge in a certain subject . if a doctor would broaden his or her knowledge , he or she would probably never look deep into medicine subject , and would just have the broad or overview of it . making this a disadvantage for them and u patient . also if my school would not have lowered the number of course , student would have never been able to really specialize in a subject , but would have simply seen the overview of it , never fully understanding each and every one of those subject . therefore in my opinion it is better to know a lot about something , than to know a little about everything .
