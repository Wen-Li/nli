i agree with with the statement that most advertisement make productes looking better than they actually are . i hold this opinion for the following reason . if we think about cataloges around the fashonindustry we have all these perfect looking model in mind with dreambodys and we suggest the clothes these model are wearing must also perfekt fit to u . we have no clue that this is not going to happen . the picture we see in the cataloges promise something it can not beeing fullfilled . another example i like to use are advertisement in travelcataloges we look up in research for a nice place to have some vacationtime , comptible hotel and the magazin show u a varitie of wunderfull posibilities of enjoing our staying and by the time we arriving there is just nothing left from the site the magzin had offered u . this can be a very disappointing experience for almost everybody . one example of a failing result is sometimes even a book wich declaired to be the best praparation for a test and it did not help at all .
