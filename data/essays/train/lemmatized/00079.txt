lets start with the statement `` successful people are not those whoe different thing in the same way , but who belive in doing the same thing but in a different way '' . i strongly feel and support that without taking any risk in life one can not expand his horizon . he will continue thinking and planning thing in the same way which make his task le interesting and le challenging and at a point of time it might lead to frustration , for example when someone constantly keep on typing the same format 100 time a day it becomes boring for him too continue it , instead if he try out a better font style new colour combination or maybe a better matter to fill up the letter sheet then he is definately trying out something that make a dull job a writting responce letter , interesting . the point is that it ha taken a lot of risk and experimentation for many successful people to be where they are today . for example mr.donald trump whom i idealise myself ha gone through so much and the people at the wall street who handle share they have gone through major heartstopping risk . one ha to make a geniune bold attempt with his idea if he think they are worth and put them to a test , you can not learn how to swim without getting wet , you have to dive in ! so in conclusion i ll like to add that it take a lot of heart and courage to try out something new , and nothing can be more depressing than a failure but it is truly said that failure are the stepping stone to success so atleast try it better to learn and gain useful knowledge because that is the true identity of a successful person .
