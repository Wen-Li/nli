this topic is not easy to answer directly . depending on the personal experience , everybody will have the different answer . some people will agree meanwhile some will disagree instead . in my point of view , travelling in a group led by a tour guide or by themselves is related to the condition and personal ability at any rate . both to travel in a group led by a tour guide and go trip on their own have countless advantage . im my opinior , i would like to travel along when i am above 20 year old . it is because that i can enjoy the trip in the processing not only the result . for example , i can choose the bike-trip and go anywhere i would like to go in china . i can stay more time when i have been interested in it . i can go to the place the tour guide will not lead u to go . i think it is the strongest point the people will choose to travel by themselves . the most essential advantage is that during the trip , we can improve our skill and ability learned from the school and out of the school . i think have a trip on your own is a unforgettable in your life . in contrast , i think it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide when i am just a student . there is no doult that the tour guide will arrange all the thing during the trip such a where we live , what we eat , where we should go and when we should spend money . it is easy for u to follow . the most significant advantage is that before the trip , we do n't need to do any work about the trip and make a schedual . it is a comfortable way and convenient for u to have a trip . however travel in a group led by a tour guide have a lot of advantage , you also can choose travel on your own . it is up to you .
