every body know jetsons the cartoon where you dont find any car people travel in jet but then that may not an hypothetical situation in the near future . in twenty year there can be a lot of development that can even be dared to think of . now if you look back at the start of the century we you have the feeling that we sailed a lot . i take the stand that there will be fewer car in the next twenty year than now , the replacememt of the car can take the following course . first , a there is huge surge in number of car in all the country 's they tend to expand there infrastructure but after reaching the saturation point you just do n't have any land left out to fulfill your residential and infrastrucute need . besides , the pollution caused due to the emmision from car need to be cut down a we have the impending threat of ozone layer depletion . thus , we arrive at situation where car are neccessary evil . then to nullify the pollution effect we go for car that are hybrid , eco-friendly , electrically charged , water operated . but we still have the infrastructure problem , so to have effective commutation in busy traffic region people will go for bike or bicycle we see that today in china , we also see hybrid model of car being launched . we also have a situation where mass commutation is becoming popular day by day and is proving to be more effective than having a own car . second step is when even with the hybrid car doe n't serve your purpose they do n't help you in getting any faster to your place . so , you naturally tend to look at the other option we have lot of air space . there is a research going on how to effectively use ion combination for transportation this process is le harmful to the environment and is effective to have air borne vehicle . this slowly but surely replaces the car in the next 20 or odd year . where naturally first the upper class people get hold of it then it reach the common man later . if i 'm not over exaggerating recently denmark scientist have a break thtough in teletransportation of material for a few meter there might be a day we can use the fruit of this when even the air traffic is also difficult to handle but it 's certainly not in the near future a it is in budding state . thus , i conclude that car will be lesser than there are today because of the above mentioned reason .
