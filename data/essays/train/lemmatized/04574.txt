the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community is wrong . just a week ago , there wa an article in the newspaper talking about teenager who won an award for helping in a local welfare house . that wa not the only article describing the work young people do for their surroundings . though not frequent , the report of them helping the society come out countinuously . the impression of not working enough for the community could be because of : their preferance of visiting particular place to work , their tending to work seprately . firstly , young people can not visit all the community that exist in their society . although they spend considerable time helping , they could give the impression of not working enough because they do n't show up every where . however , helping out every community would be impossible to youngster , since there are place where they prefer to work . for example , a public record showed most teenager like to work at a library or local festival which need many volunteer but dislike going other place . this is natural because people prefer place where their age is suitable . secondly , young people tend to work alone when helping the society . nowadays , because of people 's busy schedule , it is hard to find someone who would be willing to work together . since they are working a individual , there could be a chance that they are unnoticed while working , and people could get the idea that young people are not working at all for the society . last , but not least , even if there are young people who do n't give enough time to helping their community , they have to nowadays . major college that young people hope to attend , look through the student ' record of their contribution to local community . there are point given out after working at a community , and the accumulated point are big part of their entrance to the young people 's ideal college . in conclusion , young people do spend lot of time working for their community . because they do n't visit many community , and because most of the youngster work alone to help the society , . it could give impression of not giving enough help . also , since there is a new policy of point system in helping local community , young people would have to spend time helping out them even if they do n't want to .
