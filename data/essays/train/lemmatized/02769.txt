it may be true that everyone want to be successful . but to become succeed is not easy . if we refer to some people who have succeed in their life , we can find that what they did in order to succeed is not a same and simple a normal people do . it is common that people who were successful have a common trait . that is , they tried new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and i agree to this . we can find the evidence of the statement a we read the article of the life of famous people such a thomas edison who wa a genious in invention . also , there is a rule in the business that successful business people try new thing and take risk . i remember readinig an article about the life of thomas edison when i wa young . while reading it , i did n't understand why thomas edison tried to hatch an egg by himself , do experiment in the train , and other `` unpredictable '' thing he did . however , i now know that trying new thing like him led to him a one of the successful people in the world , in invention . it is because he learned from his tryout . he sometimes failed and succeed . when he failed , he learned why he failed from what he did by figuring out what went wrong , what need to be improved , and so on . for example , he failed to hatch an egg because there is a certain condition required to hatch an egg , the condition that hen have . on the other hand , when he succeeded , he become more confident encourage himself to try other thing . without these trait , he would not be one of the successful people . in business study , i learned that it is one of the fact that a successful business person try new thing and take risk , which is fairly true . for example , if a person want to start running a business in ice-cream market , he should have superior and interesting idea that catch the attention of consumer . to find unique idea , he try new thing such a making new flavour of ice-cream which people did n't taste before , making interesting shape of the ice-cream , and so on . moreover , he should assume that he will be responsible for taking risk a he try new thing . if his idea fails , then he should replace the financial problem resulted from the failure . however , a he get over these factor , he will later became a successful businessman in ice-cream industry . people want to be successful but it is true that most of them do n't know how to succeed . for them , i want to suggest to try new thing and take risk , a statement said .
