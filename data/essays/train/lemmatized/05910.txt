although i personally would be more than happy if this statement would be true , i can not agree with it . three major aspect make me disagree with the statement , firstly the world population in general and secondly greed for material good , the idea of personal freedom and independent traveling closely connected to the idea of having an own car . thirdly the car industry have to be taken into account who are not likely to be very willing to earn le money by producing le car . since the beginning of the industrialization more and more good have been produced for more and more people living on the earth . in the next 20 year the world population will by no mean decline , europe and north america may face this problem but the rest of the world will face a population increase . more people on the earth are likely to equal more car being around in the next twenty year and beyond . at the same time people ask for more and more good to have a more comfortable life and to prove themselves and their neighbour who they are and up to where they have made it . having a car is not only due to actual need of having one but also is a symbol of status for many people ( who then are likely to have more than just one car ) . and , one need not forget that a car actually is very practical , not only for a big family going on holiday or doing shopping but also for every individual because one doe not have to live according to public transport schedule . in area le populated than e.g. germany or the netherlands there are many place one would hardly reach without a car and a people tend to have the wish for unlimited access car will often help them to fullfil this need . lots of country like again e.g. germany earn lot of their money via the car indstries and not only would there have to be huge change done to change this but maily would it need enough force to actually want a fundamental change and at he moment this , from my point of view unfortunately , can not be seen . my argument do not only apply to the question of fewer or more car , i thing it is easily applied to all kind of modern technological good like computer , television , mobile and so on and i tstrongly believe that we have to be very careful to produce not only more and more of this good but that we have to understand that fewer car , laptop , machine of all kind , a suggested in the statement would actualy often be much better for all of u .
