in my opinion , i agree the state . because knowledge of many academic subject include in important . the human need to relate with various thing . he is grew up by various thing . and make his character . having know ledge of many academic subject , it 's possible for u to deeply grow up . morever we may influence our firends and child , family . because we are interested in various thing . for example if i can be specialize in one specific subject , exactly my knowledge wil become deeply about it . but i am worry about flexivlel spirit . often i may concentrate one thing , forget important thing . so i think it 's better to have broad knowladge of many academic subject . it is very useful , if you can change subject , you will do it . and you become specialist and having other subject . thus it is sensible for you tohave various choosing plan in your futuer . when you will retire the your job , you will have get your favorite job . having verious ability , so this is one of the reason . second many knowledge help tocomunicate eachother , friend , family and so on . it ; s fantastic idea . because human is not one . always he help other person . he want to help family or friend . it 's possible for you to keep comunication , make a friend . this is so nice . so i think i agree it .
