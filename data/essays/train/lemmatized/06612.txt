the topic at hand state that successful people do not sit back doing the same thins they have achieved , but move ahead by doings newer thing . this topic is very important because it tell the what real successful man is . i agree that sucessful people try new thing . the first reason is that a successful man know the essence of success . he know how much hard work is required to be a fruitful person . so this aspect of effort motivates him to steer ahead for reaching new height . for example if we consider the success achieved by a gold medalist in the olympics , he will not sit back , but he will always try to perform with much hardwork the year that follows . additionalll , the success that the person ha ahcieved give him immense amount of self confidence which is pretty essential for doing any sort of work . the confidence so established will help him to experiment new thing and help him to plunge ahead . consider the same example a a gold medal winner in olympics . the gold medal he achived would give him confidence to try for breaking a world record , one that is established by others or improving on the one that he himself eatablished . so a successful man experiment and wait for the output . finally , a successful man will have enough amount of patience to take new risk . an unsuccessful man may not have that same passion and patience a that of a successful man. now again consider the olympic gold medalist . if he miss an opportunity of breaking a new world record , he will be surely waiting with ardor for another opportunity . the moment he arrives on that he will try not to miss on that this time . consequentially a successful man will always try newer thing and dare to achieve a new success
