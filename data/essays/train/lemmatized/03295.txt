although i understand people who think that young people nowadays do not spend enough time on helping their community my experience led me to disagree with this statement . nevertheless , there are reason to believe that this statement is true . young people nowadys are often afraid of remain jobless after finishing university . as a result they spend all their time on preparing themselves for their professional life . for example , most of my fellow student spend a lot of time on making internship , so there is no time left to voluntarily participate community activity . further more the people in our society are getting older and older whereas the government ha le money to spend on social service . consequently , there is a need for young people who give time to help their community , especially in home for the elderly . on the other hand giving time to help the community where you live in , can however be important for your professional life . in spite of the fact that you are not dealing with the topic of your study while working , for example , in home for the elderly it might make a good impression of your social engagemant if you apply for a scholarship . a lot of student know this and therefore it is often the case that student engage voluntarily in community project . furthermore there are a lot of people in my social environment who are really interested in politics and the development of our society . as a result they participate in local political project or in one of the existing political party , which mean that they also give time to their community . in view of the fact that i know a lot of young people who engage in their community my conlusion is that it is not true that young people do not give enough time to help their community .
