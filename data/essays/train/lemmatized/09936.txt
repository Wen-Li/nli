in this era of modernisation , where man ha reached space , developed nuclear arm and made other tremendous progress , the time is more in favour of a specialist . though a general knowledge about basic subject is essential the indepth knowledge of specific subject is mostly required . the curriculum of a school is so devised a to teach the growing child the basic subject like english , science , mathematics , social study , moral education and so on . as the child grows a stage come when he ha to choose the subject he would like to specialize . in college the student are required to opt for a subject a their major area of study . he ha to choose his career . nobody would disagree that there is not much of use of literature and economics if a person wish to be a doctor or other science major . similarly the person opting for business need not care about studying biology . being a medical graduate i understand that today the world is in favour of specialist . a person if he ha contracted a disease go first to his general practitioner who try to manage the case but if the case is not recovering with his treatment he refers it to a specialist . thus the specialist look into the problem and treat effectively . the specialist sometimes may face problem a he ha to deal with a case who ha disease in many organ system thus he ha to take the help of other specialist . the need of broad knowledge about many subject may help in securin good position in quiz , exam . there are some job , that require knowledge in many subject , like teaching school child , taking care of librariesetc . but on the whole most of the job require the knowledge of a specific subject . in conclusion i believe that it is better to have indepth knowledge of a specific subject than broader about many subject a one should not be `` jack of all trade but master of none '' .
