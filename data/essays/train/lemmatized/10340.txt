the taste of each age is unique and certainly different . the thing done at different age are certainly different . however , a generalization can not be made on the degree of the enjoy taken from these thing . young people do not enjoy life more than older people do but the one who have the deepest love doe enjoy most . the amount of enjoy can only be measured with the smile on a face not with the number of the line . a young boy might be happy with watching tv but it can not be claimed that this boy is happier than his grandfather who try to get up the stair one by one for half an hour . it is a great pleasure for him to still be able to get up . from the other side , for the boy it is also a great pleasure being able to watch tv instead of working . the satisfaction is important at this point to criticise the enjoyment . to get the highest satisfaction what to do is , to do what you do with the greatest love you can have . on the other hand , appreciating brings the enjoyment . one with an enormous wealth might not be happy because money is not probably the one he enjoys . in order to be happy , one need to appreciate what he got or what he doe . otherwise , not being aware of the thing he had , noone can love living . by this way he start to love himself then love life and the rest of the world . loving brings enjoyment . to be able to enjoy the life , one ha to appreciate what he got . the enjoyment are certainly unique everyone get . young people do not enjoy life more than older people dobut the one who have the deepest love doe enjoy most . ages doe not determine the enjoyment rate but the amount of love towards what is done doe . the characterization should not be made among the body age but should be done among the soul age .
