` everything that glitter is not gold. ' summarizes my feeling on the subject very well . this statement can not be more true in today 's world where advertisement make every thing look so good and glamorus to intice people to go and buy them only to realize latter that they have been tricked and fooled . advertising is an art of selling thing or rather presenting thing to the customer , that is u the poor gullible people , in a way that make them irresistable and desirble , larger than life , so that we will be compelled to buy them . they , the advertiser stop or rather stoop at nothing to do so , at time even relying on little white lie , it only after you get the product and try it that you realize that it is not all ` gold ' . the best example of it is the weight loss product that are there in the market which claim to make you lose weight in matter of day , they also have celebrity people vouching for the product , it only after you get them that you realize how dificult it is to lose weight a those product do not do the wonder trick they claim on you . at time you would realize after buying those that they contain substance which are infact harmful for your body . the other one which particularly infuriates me are the cleaning supply product which claim that they can remove any stain from any surface without any effort `` just spray and wipe '' , you buy them get home hopeful to see all the stain dissappear from your carpet but lo and behold even after half an hour of intense scrubbing post spray those stain are still mocking at you . the other are the product which make you look younger more beautiful , restore your hair , teach you new skill in no time . the list of such advertising can just go on and on but i guess they have their reason for doing that but wish it wa not at poor customer expense and that they could present thing in their true form . but then would n't the world be perfect hmm . ...
