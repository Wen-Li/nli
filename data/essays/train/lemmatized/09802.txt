the statement that young people would enjoy life more than older poeple is to be questioned critically . in our society , especially in medium youth and beauty are regarded a some of the most important value . this perhaps is the reason , why this statement is supported by many people . but reality is not the same that mass medium want to tell u . today older poeple have allmost the same possibility a the young people have . they have a lot of experience in life and play important role in many family , in society or in the economy . the more conservative part of the older generation help raising the child or dooing the housework . this return to integration will increase , while our economical system will force young people and also parent to work more flexible and longer . other , le conservative senior still have important job in society , politics and economy and do n't seem to agree to the statement either . the phenomenon of youth a a social vulue wa born in our industrialized country . but the current developement seems to be a change of view on this topic . today people get much older than they did a houndred year ago . achievements in medicine and pharmaceutica allow a longer and much more prosperous life for most people . further threre are le child born to balance the bigger count of older people in our society . the big firm allready realized this developement and defined a new group of customer . they call them `` best agers '' . i geuss the name itself implies our societie 's future view on the older generation and the older people 's on themselves . today and in future the age of a person will no longer determine what to do or how to feel about one 's life .
