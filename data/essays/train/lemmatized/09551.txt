ideas , concept and fact are related , in a way but different in many thing that we must consider . well if we looked at idea and concept it need alot of effort for the student to learn them across the academic year it neads frome the student to understand the idea and creat a creative one . concepts somtimes need to be expained , analize , use and memorize . what i am trying to reach is that it need alot of effort , help and time . leaning fact can be fun and interesting . for inctase we can know also fact from our experience in life , infact they are easy to know and learn , becouse there are many source that we can learn fact from not only frombooks but also from program in tv , internet , and also comic . what i think is that it is important for the student to understand idea and concept becouse they are difficalt to lean by them self while fact are easier to find , explore and understand . another thing is that the school will make it easier to learn idea and concept , becouse they are provided with capable teacher and competable student to learn whith . facts also must be understood by the student , but it is very easy to learn , so this is my opinion and my idea about it but at the end there must be fact icluded in the criculam , but not a much a the idea and concept .
