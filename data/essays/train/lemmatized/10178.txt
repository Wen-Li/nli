no one can deny the importance of knowledge . however , to every person , no matter how clcver he or she is , it is ipossible to know everything in the world . so most of u will face the problem to choose what to learn , and there come the saying that it is better to have a broad knowlege of many subject than to specialize in one specific subject . personally , i do n't think it a wise choice . a broad knowlege seems to make people to look more intellegent , because whatever you talk about with him he will say `` oh yes , i know ! `` or `` i have ever read it in a book . '' it appears that they know everything . hewever doe these `` mr '' or `` miss know-all '' really understand what they 're saying ? after a further disscussion you will get the answer is `` no '' . due to the limitation of time and energy , it is almost sure that if a person try to learn too much acdemic subject at a time , the result would be he can grasp none of them well . a better way is to fosus on one specific subject . maybe it is a little boiling but you can learn the nature of the subject . specialization is what the modern sociaty asks for . when looking for job , the company will ask `` what you can do '' and you are supposed to have something that can not be taken placed by others
