during my life i made many social work to support my community . i think that i can disagree with the statement : `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' because i 'm a young person and i do it . but i kown that this statement is truth in many community and in many group of young people . infact many young people do n't make nothing to help or to support their communitie . this situation is because they do n't feel part of their community . for example if a young person change his home many time he ca n't feel a part of a community and i understand that is difficul to help some unknown thing . also because if you do n't know a thing you ca n't imaginate of what this thing need . sometime young people are criticated by their community and so it very difficult that young people want help them . sometime young people have really too many thing to do . for example school , sport , work . .. and they have no time for social attivities . i think that is very important for a young person make some thing for his community because in this way he can feel able to help some one .
