i agree with this statement because i beleive that trying new thing and taking risk are more interested than knowing how to do well . in my case , sinec i wa ten year old , i have been playing tennis , so i practice tennis every day and sometimes compete on the tennis . when i play on the match , i try to play new thing which is so fantastic for me , and usually , when i try newthings , i can win the tounament . in similar to succesuful people , trying new thing and tasking risk are connected to successful thing : sport player and successful businessmem . successful sport player are always trying new thing and take risk . for example , roger federer , who is tennis champion in the champion . he always enjoys the mathc a well a try new thing , which have high risk . however , he is not afraid of takiing risk , and he hit the ball to the opponent '' weak point . he take energey from trying new newthings and taking risk , so he would be tennis champion in th world . therfore , i believe that similar to him , sport palyers show that taking risk and trying new thing is neccessary key . in addition to successful sport player , successful businessmen or woman are apt to try new thing and take risk , but sometimes , they think that taking risk and trying new thing have dangerous , but we can make a lot of money and fame . also , in today 's society , which is democracy a well a competiotion society , so they always demand winning . i beleive that trying new thing and taking risk is concerned with successful people . in fact , sport player and businessmen or woman show that .
