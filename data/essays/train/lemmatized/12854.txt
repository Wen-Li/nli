some people think that having board knowledge of many subject is better than having knowledge in one specified subject . but i disagree with it . as i think specilization in one subject is better than having board knowledge about many academig subject . firstly , having specilization in one subject , the person can have good hold on the subject . the person will have the detail of the minor topic of the subject . it will prove to be helpful from his job perspective . he can be able to perform his job very well without anyone 's help . he will be able to solve any kind of problem . thus proving to be more successful in his career . this may not be possible if the person had not done specialization in one subject . for example , the person may put his creativity and develope more intresting thing a he ha more knowledge on the subject . secondly , the person can have full confidence on what he is speaking . he can also help others in that subject . he can attempt to carry out some research in that perticular subject , provide more information about the subject and also gain more information about the subject . this way he can not only improve his knowledge int subject but also help others improve their knowledge by carrying out the research . for example , by putting in his knowledge on the subject he can develope new and reviced theoriea that would prove to be helpful to others who use it later on . by having board knowledge of many subject , the person may not be able to achieve the height of the success that he could by having specialization in one subject . that would be so , because he would have minimum information about every subject , and that he can not go deep into any subject . thus limiting his creativity . thus i disagree with the statement which say 's `` it is better to have board knowledge of many acadimic subject than to specialise in one specific subject .
