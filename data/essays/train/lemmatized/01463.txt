according to a friend of mine , the main difference between the french academic system and american one 's is about the knowledge . indeed , the french prefers to study a lot of subject until university whereas americans have the possibility to choose the specialisation quite quickly . in my opinion , to be specialized in one specific subject can be really interesting . actually , the person is really performant and it can be benefit for the firm . and sometimes , this specific subjct is really difficult and searched . this job can worth a lot of money ! however , i definitly prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic . first of all , we know many more information about the world and it could be helpful to have an overview . then , for a future job , it could be better to know several thing and choose the one where i am the best . moreover , if , i quit my job for differents reason ( employmemts , personal problem . .. ) i will be happy to have others qualification in my resume . for instance , actually , i am in a business school and we learn manys thing . when i chose my subject i chose a third language , italien . i really think that , in the future , it will be better to understand 3 language instead of only one ! i will give you another exemple . if you have an ability , that is good ! but do n't lay on it ! in this world , there qre so many thing intersting , if we had the chance to study let 's do it ! that is the best opportunity in life ! to sum up , the specialization is great but having a broading knowledge give u the best chance in life for our future carrier !
