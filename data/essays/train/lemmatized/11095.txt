i disagree with the statement . an elaborate analysis of the reason in favour of and against the notion would clarify my stand and help u develop a better understanding of the concept . some would say that the young generation is money oriented and is involved in selfish deed . but the point to be considererd here is that these money oriented youngster contribute to the formation of a strong world economic backbone . hence , every moment spend in earning money is in itself a contribution towards the upliftment of their community . youngsters do not look at the world like a divided place with boundary and category of community . tied up with the string of globalisation they all feel united and responsible to their single world global community . they serve in every field of life and hence ensure a global upliftment of the human race . they are there in development of new technology in the various field like medication , communication , etc . along with contributing indirecttly towards their community they also face thei responsibility directly . they perform vital role in representing their community politically . the special need of each community is explained by it representative properly . moreover they are there in the entertainment industry , hence representing their respeftive community before the entire world and help them being a part of the global happy family . the idea of globalisation is so ingratiated into the comming genereations that they are ready to shed all the difference of color cast race etc and come united under the shade of love for each other . hence keeping in mind that the revolutionay idea of globlisation ha changed the world i stick to my stand
