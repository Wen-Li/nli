i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . success usually come to people who wok with determination and dedication to achieve their goal . they work in all direction to achieve their goal . for example , a fashion designer would earn more fame for her or his innovative idea rather than retaining the old idea . they need to try newer thing in order to pace up with the every day fashion , or they are termed a out dated . in buisness too , a person reach a pinnacle only when he us newer technique to promote his project . he need to take risk to develop or expand his buisness empire rather than sticking to old idea in this 21st century . a computer software engineer should try something innovative and interesting depending on his capability to achieve height in his career rather than just doing a job . on the other hand it is always not necessary that a person who try newer thing are succeessfull . for example , a doctor should not try newer thing or take risk on patient life , they should rather do what they already have been practising . practise make a man perfect . a highly experienced doctor is more succeessful than a le experienced doctor . he can heal a patient or cure him with his experience which teach him a how to deal with the his illness , what appropriate antibiotic or what apt surgery should be performed . so succeess conquer people who try new innovative idea , work with dedication and determination ..
