most advertisement make a product seem much better that they really are . and there is a reson why company do that . that reason is that with more buyer a product ha , the more proffits they are going to make . producers are always looking for way to attract more user of the product , and they do so by attracting people with add that often might not reflect the truth about a product . firstable , in most of the commercial it appears that the person using the product is happier and is leaving an easier life than the one who doe not use it . for example ; in an add used by toyota , the person driving the toyota could have a more pleasant trip and get to place faster . and they show people in the street jeoulus and their car seemed to be le effective . then we have the ad where only joung and beautiful people appear . beer add can be a perfect example of these ; because they are often shown whith girl in a bikini and guy at a party . this can measlead a person thinking , and make them believe that drinking that kind of beer is going to make them feel goo and look `` cool '' in front of other people . we know beer doe n't make you more beautiful and cool it just make you drunk ! . finally , add never show the negative effect of using a product . in a cocacola add you are never going to see people getting fat or people showing a lot of cellulite on their boddies . and there are the true long-term effect of drinking soda . you just see family and joung people having fun and saying taht cocacola is the best drink ever . in conclusion , we don 's have to believe everything we see . and to prevent being fooled by some attractive add , we must keep in mind that most company are not tryinh to give u a better life , the are just trying to increase their proffits by making ud believe the product is right for u . we need to be informed and make our desicions based on our other option and what is more convinient , not based on what an add say .
