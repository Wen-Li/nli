most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in fact , all over the world use this process . here in my native country lebanon , they show the product a a super thing and in fact , it is much le than it appears . first of all , i see wherever i go advertisement that make the product very good , and when i go to buy or see it , i find all the time that it is fake . the owner of the product always exagerates in the advertisement to attract the people . for example , i bought once a bike on the internet , the bike looked very nice and big and when they delivered it to me i found that it is a small and ugly bike . from every experience , i learn something till i found in the end that u can not trust any advertisement and u have to see the product in front of you before you buy it . furthermore , the product owner have to compete with each others , because there are a lot of factory that offer the same product . also , the advertisement for the product have to look good to attract the eye . for example , once i saw different advertisement for the same product and one of them wa really good and attractive , so i decided to go to the shop that made this advertisement and buy from it . therefore the advertisement have to be good and the product should look much better than they really are to attract the buyer like they attracted me . in conclusion , the marketing for the product is very important , and the advertisement should be attractive . therefore , the product seem much better than they really are . in addition to that , the buyer have to be mature enough to differentiate between product to buy the right thing .
