here i want to sight a quotation that `` who dare win '' . i feel that successful people are those people who have taken risk to do well in their respective field or taken a risk of choosing a new field to succeed . i feel that no proffession or venture of human is risk free . for example if a man have money to invest , he should risk to invest the money in a new bussiness or even share of some reputed company . if he doe not take this risk to invest in one field or other , his money may loose it 's value after some period . if this risk turn to be fruitful , we can say that the risk the man taken succeeded . we can also say that the man is a successful man . if a man go on doing the same work he know how to do well sometime or the other he will feel life to be boredom . so taking risk make man to live lively . if our premature man have not taken the risk of finding fire , we might be eating the same raw meat and uncooked food . if they have not taken the risk of hunting animal in those day the human race that we see now may not be existing . if scientist have not taken the risk of spending their time or brain on inventing new thing , we may not be in this developed world of high scientifisc adavancement . in medicine field if the then doctor ha not taken the risk to operate a person by surgery many disease or injury of little importance now might still be lethal to human life causing many death . all the recent advance in the automobile or aeroplane is because of risk that wa taken by our forefather in developing them . i feel that all the knowledge that we enjoy now in any field like space research or medicine is because of the risk that were taken by one or the other . so in my opinion no proffession is risk free and there is no existance of this world if no one take risk .
