the idea is good to me . i think that the most important aspect for the wisdom is to understand the idea and concept that we have heard in the school . for the student is important too the comunication with the porfessor . but no always the situation is the most comfortable for the student and the academic . many time , the place where the student show their question not is in the classroom . when anybody do n't understand something in the class is necesary to explain other time . we know that to learn is not a simple work , each mind is different and the level of complexity change in each human . when a professor is not sure that hir pupil have understood the principal idea of the tem he must do question about the exposition , if the answeres are correct he can go on but if he comprove the other situation he can teach the problem once more . but the reality is n't , many time , simple . the situation is complicate when the people do n't understand nothing about the explication but do n't pay attention or because a problem of concentration . the pschycological study have been demostred u that mind work more slowly in this century . why , in our century , not only the student , in general , the people have a big problem to understand and learn new thing ? why our mind work more slowly ? about this quaestion the pscycologist richard frazer say : the television and the other machine , product of the xx century are the cause of the massive slownees of the wordl . the human thinks the computer , the television , tha game and others ahve been invented to help u , to do life mor easy and fast , but is no true .
