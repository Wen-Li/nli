i totally agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . today , advertisement and marketing play more and more a decisive role in business world . as the competition is considerable , the firm are obliged to sell theirs product . therefore , they have to create a brilliant advertisement convincing the customer and sometimes they invent advantage of theirs product which doe n't exist . in order to enhance the market position and to stay competitive , the firm try to present their product a an ideal product . it is obvious that several customer are disappointed after having bought the product due to the fact that the product doe n't fit to the feature made in the advertisement . the globalisation is certainly one of the reason why the advertisement become more and more irrealistic . the firm and the product are pressed to compete not only with firm of their own country or their continent but also with firm from all over the world . the advertisement are distributed and shown in several country so that the pressure increase . the world is become one huge market . thus , one can even understand why the firm change the product feature . in this context , it is necessary to mention the role of marketing . the budget of the marketing department are in general very high . for this reason , the firm are able to create sophisticated advertisement which comprise special effect and sometimes even coincide with film . because of the perfect advertisement , the customer could believe that the product is perfect . nevertheless , i think that the advertisement should reflect the real caracteristics of the product . the firm should be fair and respect theirs customer by not making the product better than they reallz are .
