in the recent year , many educator , parent and student have discussed how the student learn more efficiently and effectively . there are two different philosophy that ha been proposed in this hot topic . one is to understand idea and concept and another one is to learn fact . most western country like united states and canada , the teacher encourage the student to understand idea and concept first . the teaching approach is not bound to the fact that the student do not urge to remember a lot of information and fact from the textbook . for example , the teacher try to use some daily example to explain some concept in science such a physic , chemistry and biology . at the same time , the student can develop their own creative , innovative and troubleshooting ability . meanwhile , it is good for the student to be capable of brainstorming in this very competitive community . in the other hand , most eastern country such a china , japan and so , the teacher prefer to ask the student to remember a lot of fact and information so a to build up their fundamental basis on their study . however , most of the student can not advocate their interest in their study . in addition , the student are not willing to accept more new concept or they are not able to develop any novel idea in their study . for example , the student are good at memory , but not on any innovation or troubleshooting issue in their living either . thus , it is not an effective and flexible way for them to deal with the difficulty and hurdle that they really face in the reality . to be concluded , i totally agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . this approach would be more beneficial to the student in order to encounter and survive in this competitive world .
