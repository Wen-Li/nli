according to me it is important for student to understand the idea and concept a well a to learn the fact . i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept . once he understands the idea and concept well at the basic level he can proceed in his learning and can develop his or her understanding to the higher level and can also master in the subject which the student ha taken . the understanding will help him and motivate him for further study and he can excel . ideas and concept are basic thing the student should understand . like for an example the botany student doe not understand the concept of photosynthesis he can not understand anything about his subject because concept of photosynthesis is the basic concept the botany student should know . therefore understanding concept and idea is much more important for student than fact . once he understands the concept and idea he can work and build his understanding on fact . as the student get motivated by doing well by understanding the idea and concept he or she will automatically motivated for further enhancement of fact . fact are a part of idea and concept . like when a student understands idea about photosynthesis he will have the detail fact about what each part of the tree doe and how doe the part of the tree participate in photosynthesis
