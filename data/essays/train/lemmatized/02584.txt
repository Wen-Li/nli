older people enjoy life more than younger people do . from my perspective , the world is made for older people , instead of younger . when you are young you get ignored for what ever you do by olders . also , the world is created because olders made lot of efford to develop the world . when you are older you can experience whatever you like , you can have freedom , and you have power to control youngers . when you are older you can experience what ever you love . you can drink alchol , you can go to anywhere you like , and you can choose what to do for the career . when you are young you are ruled by parent that they only want good , model stuents . they want you to do well in study , sport and anything . i myself had difficult life when i wa young , i wa kind of stuck with my parent that , i could n't do whatever i like . when you are older you can have freedom . for a long a you like , you can go the wherever country you like . if i turn thirty , i want to go around the world and explore different culture . when you are young your parent want to be with you all the time . they do n't want you to go anywhere but the house . thats what older people can enjoy life more than younger people do . when you are older you have power to control over young people . say , you are police you have power to rule over young people , and teacher can do it too . young people are just the step to be olders . that 's why young people can not enjoy life . they are limited to enjoy life . in other hand olders have so much time and energy to enjoy life . also the vision is different , between young people and older people . older people have much more wider view than young people . that 's how older people can enjoy their life . these are the reason why older people are better than young people . older people can experience , have freedon , and have power . world is like the world to older people not for the young people . if young people want to explore better life , they should study hard and may have patience to be older people . older people enjoy life more than young people do .
