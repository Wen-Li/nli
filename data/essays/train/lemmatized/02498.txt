i agree with this statement because of following reason . first , it is natural that advertisement make product seem better than they really are because the advertisement want to sell their good . second , i always look forward to seeing new product ' advertisememts because it is really fun for me a a customer . if the advertisement show real prodcuts to consumer , i think the advertisemant company havs difficultis in capturing consumer ' attention , and geeting a lot of money . indeeed , that the advertisement do not give consumer to ther real product looking is not so good aspect a consumer . however , if the advertisement always show exact what product look like , i am not going to buy the product and watch the advertisement like cms , magazine , and poster . finally , the advertisement company can not attein a lot of money from cms , magazine , and poster . i think that usually the company earn a great deal of money from advertising . thus , if they are not allowed to get mony from these advertisement , the company would not make better advertisesments than previous one . in addition , if many customer become not go to the store , the store are suffered from that . the advertisement are really effective way to sell product , and store also take a lot of advantage . all in all , i agree with this statemant a a consumer .
