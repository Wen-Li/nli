`` it is better to habe broad knowledge of many subject than to specialise in one specific subject '' i surely agree with this statement because when you have a bigger baggage of cultural and scientifical information you can be a better person and live a better life in all of it aspect but none the le for certain people to specialise in one specific subject will be more useful to them than to specialise in many academic subject . first of all when you have a broad knowledge of many academic subject you have a good degree wich will help you in the course of your life per example you will have a bigger chance to get employed then another applier that have only specialised in one specific subject so it will help improve your revenue . and this variety of academic subject couls also help you in your social life where you are informed to lot of information that could be a subject of a conversation with another inbdivudual . and a person benefit the most by his broad information is the intellegence and the experience that could help him in how he life his life , the way he think about thing , the way he reacts to certain thing , his interest his taste . all these advantage are useful to the person ha decided to have broad knowledge of many academic subject and ha the capacity of achieving this goal . but some person dont have the same capacity so for this category of people it is better for them to specialise in one specific subject where they can be good at it . as a conclusion i can repeat that i am and i aplly this statement in my personnal life because it open more door and enhanse your life with various information , but if someone hasnt the ability to conduct this way of life it would be better for him to specialise in one subject so he could be good at it because in this case it is better to be good in one subject than be bad in all of the others subject because we dont have the time or the ability to succed .
