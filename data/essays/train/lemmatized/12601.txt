implying that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well '' is not a very reliable concept of one 's success in my opinion . yes , it is true that you have to try new thing or new idea because we live in a very fast moving economy and new business and technology are rising steadily . but you also have to trust your own way of accomlishing thing especially if you know how . to manifest my opinion i want to give you an example . let 's say a veterinarian performes surgery on a dog the `` old-fashioned '' way with scapel blade and other device . it ha always been like this and the successful outcome and fast healing support this idea . nowadays some veterinarian use laser to do surgery . it 's being promoted to be faster and le bloody . but the wound healing is really ugly . the wound keep draining , the owner are complaining about the mess and there is also a very high chance of infection . doing it the old way with scaple blade incision and suture afterwards is taking a little longer of course but is more sufficient because the healing is faster in my opinion and you do n't have to worry too much about wound care a far a draining go . also the dog itself will be happier because there is no inconveniently oozing spot on the body . and if the dog is happy , the owner are happy and the veterinarian ha successfully done his/her work . so , you do n't have to try so-called `` new thing '' or try `` risky business '' a long a you know that you are doing it the right way . and by doing it the right way you will do well afterall . and to stress my disagreement with the above statement i 'm going to write my favorite quote : `` never chance a winning team '' !
