when learning a specific subject in school , student are required not only to know the information regarding the subject but also to understand the concept implied . these two aspect are very differnt and require differnt ability from student . though it is important to know the fact for a subject , it is more important for a student to understand the idea and concept in order to have a thourough understanding of the topic . first of all , simply memorizing fact doe not imply knowing the topic . if a student doe so , she is just regurgitating what she ha read or heard which doe n't mean she know what she ha learned . on the other hand if a studen understands the concept and idea related to the topic , then he understands the implication a well a the us of the topic . for example in history , though it is often precieved a a subject which merely requires memorizing , a student need to understand the concept in order to full appreciate the subject . merely memorizing date and occurences doe not offer real insight a to why certain event occur and what effect these event could have on our present society . furthermore , understanding concept a opposed to just learning fact allows a student to deal with any type of question . a student that ha only learned fact will be expecting question that ask him to answer with the fact he ha learned . if a question deal with a deviation of these fact , then the student would not be able to adequatly ansewer the question . a student on the other hand , who understands the concept implied would be able to use her procces of induction and deduction to come to logical answer . i , personaly , have come across such dilema in a physic test . the question i found on the test , dealt with a concept that we had not read or discussed previously in class . fortunatly , i had a good understanding of the concept and idea involved wich allowed me to derive the appropriate formula that wa required for the test . finally , understanding concept and idea , allows a student to retain the subject and topic for a longer time . a student who memorizes fact is more likely to forget these once the test or examination is finished , so that the knowledge is thus not aquired . for a student who doe understand the concept , though she may forget the fact in the future , but she will still be able to think the process logicaly and come to a conclusion that would be adequate .
