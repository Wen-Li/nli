we are living in crowded city and there are lot of car . transportion very important part of the city life because we chance place so many time during the day . for my self i am almost getting crazy with that crowd . we have to solve this problem , we are getting aware to emergency of this situation . i agree with this statment . there will be fewer car in use than there are today . because this traffic proplem can be remain like that and also petrol source reduce day by day , we have to find another source for transportion and every thing . most of the government try to attact people attantion to the importance of public transport . i think it is easy way to solve this problem , if they use the public transport there wont be any traffic jam and people can go to job an time besides there will not be air pollition at all . in the traffic jam people 's car became unseful thing . because there is no point to buy a car . if you ca n't go to anywhere why you have a car . in this point i think people will change to their mind about car and start to use more public transport . i have another reason to sopport this statment that is limit of petrol source . none of the source we can use for ever that is why we have to find other sourge , new source will change the way of transportion and maybe in twenty yearys we wo n't use car . instead of car we can use electrical machine , i think these day we use one of them , that is underground . it is a first pattern of the alternative transportion . consequently , i belive that there will be fewer car than there are today . actually this is some kind of obligation because limit of the source and car not very useful at all . i hope we can find new way that is le cause to air pollition .
