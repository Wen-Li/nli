there were always innovation and people who try something new . there are three reason why i think that it is important to try new thing and to take risk to be successful . first , if people take the risk to sell it new idea they have the possibility to be very successful . new idea have the characteristic that nowbody else offer this idea or product . for example , bill gateshad the idea of a new computer software . he wa successful because he wa the first who sold his idea and he took the risk of losing all his money . second , human always need to develope new product . for example , medicament for new illness . scholars have to take the risk , that the medicament doe not work or cause other illness . before the medicament can be sold to the people it ha to be tested for a long time . if the test are not successful , the work of the scholar is not worth anything . the scholar want to develpe something new and take the risk . third , new thing and innovation are very interresting . people like new electronic device , dangerous attraction in theatre or show and new taste and smell for food or deodorant . every company that developes a new product ha to invest money to invent it . after the company ha to pay money for marketing , product placement and so on to sell it product successful . the amount of money the company spends is the risk it take . but without taking the risk it ha to sell it old product but mostly costumer do not want old product . they are only successful if they take the risk and be the first company that offer a new product . in conlusion , these three reason show that it is important to use new idea and innovation and to take risk to be successful .
