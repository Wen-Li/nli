in my point of view , i agree with that most advertising or commercial messeges make product look much better than they really are . there are three reason of my opinion . first , all of company advertise their product to sell a much a they can , so they try to show their product much better than they really are . they even spend their cost for advertising tremendously , and in these day , many of company consider how to make the best advertisement or commercial messege and hire some specialist for that . for instance , one of the big company in country , toyota usually estimate it cost for advertising approximately 20 ~ 30 % of their budget annualy . i assume that others also spend the budget for that . second , the company usually try to make their image better and advertising is the primary stragedy for that . in my country , image of company , industry , and production depend on what sort of advertisement and commercial messege they do and how they make the consumer impress about them . in my country , about 10 year ago a small venture company got bankruptsy because of the commercial messege and it wa brought to the court . the judge ruled that the image wa part of sexial harrassment . i think this is rare example , but that is the advertising . finally , the advertising company are also doing their business . in my country , i think it is the same a in the united states , the competition between the advertising company are also hard and they try to make the best commercial they can . so , their motivation is also very high . in asia , there is a big competition of commercial messege and they decide the best commercial in every year . in conclusion , i can not say this is good because we are confused because of the advertisement and we just buy something , even if it is not good . all we should do is just look anything carefully when we buy something .
