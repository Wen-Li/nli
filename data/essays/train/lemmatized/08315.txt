some people think that it is better to learn about lot of subject instead of specializing in one specific subject . i prefer the second posture , studying one specific subject . i think like this because i would like to be the best person in the world to deal whith my future job . if everyone thoght a me , there would n't exist competition to get job post . i prefer to do my best in the subject i like , rather than performing not so well in many academic subject . this decision should be well thought by everyone . if we want to have a perfect world we should dedicate very hard to the subject we like . in my opinion , when someboady finish his or her career and ha the doubt of having a master on that subject or studying another thing to broaden his or her knoledge , the decision should be the first one mentioned . having a broad knowledge ha it advantage to . for instance , if some one needed help , you would be able to give him a piece of advice , but this piece of advice wo n't be the same one given by a specialist in the subject . to sum up , i think in the world should exist people with both type of knowledge , so a to complement themselves in a good way . but , i think that there is more need of specialist than of people with a broad knowledge . this doe not mean that specialist will know only about his subject . then , when he finish his master , he can incorporate knowing of other type of subject in a different way . in conclution , i think i would prefer specializing in only one specific subject so a to be a great professional in my job .
