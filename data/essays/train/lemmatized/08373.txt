i agree with the statement that `` it 's more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . basically many people do not know the fact of certain reason or somthing else . they agree with the fact only when some others have strong reason to prove it . but if they are familiar with the concept and idea they can think of the and they can decide of it whether it is correct or wrong . consider the following example to prove my statement . in the earlier day when technology wa not in the advanced state many people thought earth to be a flat surface and they followed it for a long time . but later on when a scientist discovered that earth wa in spherical in shape the whole world wa against him . he tried to prove it by certain law and principle . but the people in those day were not able to understand his idea and concept . so , they argued with him and did not agree with his statement . later on when people began to understand his idea and concept agreed with him . another example is consider the subject like mathematics or physic . if the student doe not know the concept of the subject or doe n't have an idea in it , he will not be to understand anything in it . suppose in physic we try to prove many fact using certain law and concept . the student should understand the concept to know the fact of that law . now a day many student are familar with the idea and concept . so , they try to obtain the fact from tere own concept and knowledge . nobody are required for the to prove the fact for them . so instood of trying to prove the fact for the student make them to know concept and idea of the fact . so , that they can understand the fact by themshelves without proving for them . so , if student understand idea and concept than knowing the actual fact , they can only conclude of the fact without others tring to prove the fact for them
