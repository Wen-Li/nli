in people 's life , they need a guide who can lead them to the right way and the also need sorrounders ' help while they do everyting brand new . otherwise people might be lost their way or go to an incorrect direction . therefore , i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . when people tralvel in a group they can help each other and make the trip safely . led by a tour guide is also important because people will go to the right direction and they wo n't get lost . while people chose how to travel , they will chose travel in a group . so do i. several year ago when i wa in grade 6 , i wanted to have a trip and because of my parent are very busy so they can not take me to travel . they did n't allow me to travel alone . i wa extremely disappointed and did n't eat for a whole day . my parent 's felt awful . then , they came up with an idea which wa took me to the travelling center , and the travelling center would have a group trip just for student . so i joined the group and i had a wonderful trip . i thing my parent took me to travel in a group because it wa safe and these `` cute '' guy would help each other when they have difficulty . all in all , travel in a group is safe and people can help each other . even though travel in a group is safe , people can still lost their way because they do n't know where to go in a brand new place . they may go to incorrect direction or stay at one place for a long time . these well loss lot of time and time is our life . and these may make people in trable and in danger . therefore , we need a tour guide to led the travelling group to go to the correct way and leave the `` trables '' alone so that it will be much more safe and save our time . in conclusion , if people want to have a safety and fantastic trip , travel in a group led by a tour guide is very important because we do n't want hanppiness and trables beside u .
