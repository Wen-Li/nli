i do not agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i want to explain my point of view with the following reason . first of all , understanding is the key requirement to learn successfully , even fact . how doe someone want to learn fact without understanding them ? even fact require a proper understanding of them because fact are not only fact but also related other area of knowledge . furthermore , fact are not combined with learning strategy , wheras the understanding and comprehension of information are always linked to the `` how '' , the way and the mean how to understand idea and concept properly . this brings u to the relevance of learning method . in order to comprehend idea , fact , theory represented in text or in presentation , it is important to be aware of different learning strategy . students confronted with idea and concept at school or university have to develop strategy which enable them to steer their concentration in order to learn the most important component of an idea . moreover , another decisive point about understanding idea and concept connected with the idea of learning strategy development , is that compared to fact they can help more in real life . facts are also important , of course , but in life , which doe not consist of loose fact but of social interaction and thing always related to each other , it is more helpful to combine exterior and new information with old one . in addition , there are a lot of concept and theory about to know how to combine old with new knowledge . statistics can depict with the help of fact how thing appeare in number , but onlz helpful strategy about how to comprehend idears prpoerlz van
