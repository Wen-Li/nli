students learn many subject in school . teachers feel difficulty how to teach . some people think that studying fact is more important than studying idea and concept . on the other hand , others believe that learning idea and concept is more important than leaning fact . in my opinon , knowing idea and concept is more important than knowing fact . i will explain reason to support my view . ideas and concept is helpful for student to understand fact . first of all , idea and concept are besic of all fact . without basic theory , student can not understand fact . for instance , there are many theory to understand people 's behavior in psychology . i could understand others behavior and my feeling by understanding these theory . secondly , using idea and concept , individual can develop idea and extend their view of point . in short , idea and concept should be learned first . learning idea and concept enable student to solve problem quickly . first of all , student can think issue logically because idea and concept make problem easier to understand . secondly , student learn skill effectively . for instance , to learn language , such a english , student need to learn grammer and structure . only listening native speaker 's conversation is not enough to master english . in brief , idea and concept is useful for student . of course , learning fact is also important . however , usually fact are matter to support idea or concept , therefore fact are supplyment for them . in addition , observing fact is interesting and student are attracted study by wathing fact , yet after all student need idea or concept to study their interest deeply . to conclude , idea and concept is a neccesity for student to consider subject deeply . on the other hand , fact are only one aspect of real phenomenon . hence , it is not difficult to say that leaning idea and concept is more important than learning fact .
