ithe importance and popularity of travelling is still raising , everybody is interested in getting to know other country and continent but the way how to do it , are very differently . i agree with the statement that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide . if you travel in a group and you have a tour guide you get to know the most famous place and you get to know interesting thing about the country you decided to visit . the tour guide would organise everything for you , so the only thing you would have to do is to go to the appointment with the group . another aspect is that you would get to know a lot of interesting people . when you travel in a group it is very easy to get to know other people because usually you sit in the same bus or you sleep in the same hotel like the others do . that is why you are never borring when you travel in group . if you decide to travel in a group and you visit a country which is dangerouses then the tour guide can inform you about this dangerouses and he can say you how to avoid risk . sometimes there are special rule or other thing which can bring you in trouble when you do not follow them . furthermore a tour guide can help you with communication problem . when you are not able to speak the language people in the country you visit speak , then the tour guide can help you because he ha to be able to speak it . so if you have to visit the doctor or you have to go to the police because something happended to you , then you can ask your tour guide and he would be able to help you . these are the reason why i prefer to tavel in a group with a tour guide .
