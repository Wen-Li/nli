i agree to the fact that young generation is increasingly becoming more negligent about their community and ignoring the obligation they on the behalf of their community . i think that this is mainly because the drastic change that we are facing on the global level . in this age of globalization . every one today need to compete on a world level so one need to be very much target oriented if he want to make significant progress in his professional life . and because of this young generation is not able to give enough time to their community . in earlier day when there were slow mode of transportation and communication were available . at that time working area of young people wa limited and they remained connected with their local land , they faced and observed the problem of their community . this led to them think about their people and inspired to do something for their betterment . but today life ha become much more complex . every one is running restlessly to serve their verious purpose for to make their career , to earn money etc . and they dont have any motivation which force them to devout some of their effort for the well being of their community . every one ha become a little bit self oriented . also education burden and the pressure for building their career on the young generation do not provide much time to think about growing problem in their community . most of the young people now a day living away from their home land either for the purpose for study or working with some multinational company . they rarely have time to meet their family and see their home land . and a the famous saying go `` out of site is out of mond '' , they rarely find time to think about their community .
