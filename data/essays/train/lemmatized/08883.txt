is it more important for student to understand idea and concept or is it more important for them to learn fact ? in my opinion it is more important to understand concept and idea for several reason . fortunately i had the oppurtunity to experience high-school in germany and in the united states of america . in germany there are no fact asked in test or exam . moreover you absolutely will not find any multiple choice question . in juxtaposition to this multiple choice question and remembering fact is basically all i did while i wa in chicago . i never really had to work with the fact i memerized . today i can say i forgot almost everything i have learned in the us but i still understand the concept and idea that were taught to me in germany . another reason why it is more important to understand concept is the following . a person that is able to memerize a lot is not necesarilly an intellegent person . so it is possible that a rather unintellegent person get higher grade in school than person that ha a high iq if only fact are asked . in my opionion the studying fact should be rewarded but you should not be able to achieve a very high grade by just memerizing fact . my last and most important point is that understanding idea and concept prepares you better for your work life . all these fact you might have learned in school will not help you if you can not work with them . and the first step to work with them is to understand the main idea . understanding the main idea make it also a lot easier to memerize it . so from understanding concept you pick up fact anyways . i believe if you understand the idea and concept you will memerize the most important fact anyways . therefore just memerizing fact is a le advanced way of learning . as a consequent of this it make it more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
