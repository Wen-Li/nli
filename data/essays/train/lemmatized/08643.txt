i disagree with the statement . travel around the world is an experience that give you the opportunity to open your mind and develop new point of view . travel is not always connected with a much information you can add to your knowledge , travel is more than that ! it 's connected with emotion . a new trip is like a new person in your life . you can imagine how could be this relationship if it 's led by someone else , a guide ! you can not plan in advance exactly what you are going to receive from something that you do n't know yet . of course you have to make a plan of your trip especially according with your time and budget available , but it 's always important have the opportunity to change if you find something that you do n't enjoy . a guide may be usefull for old people , because they have no more the energy to organize all the trip . and travel with other people can be an opportunity to feel more security . the sense of freedom for me is important . it 's a waste of time waiting for other decision . i want travel alone is also cheeper , because you can choose your own
