iam dis agreeing with the statement that it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the student more eager to learn through the experimenting the fact than the learning by understanding the fact . because understanding fact is just theoritical . learning fact is the practical . so , i prefer experimenting than theoritical explanation . when the student told by theoritically he may not understand . where a if he showed practically surely he will understand . for eg ; fact is water flow from height to the lower place . if the teacher told him orally he may understand or not understand . but if he showed the water flow once he wo n't forget . so that fact should be proved practically then only every one understands . idea and concept are told by some one . the learn fact are by the student his own by in the learning process . idea and concept are helpful in the academic wise . the learn concept are useful in leading life comfortably . fact and concept of all are not practicable . so that along with the fact and concept the learning fact are got equal importance . initially student will understand the idea and concept . a age grows he learns through the learning fact . for eg ; in younger age what teacher tell in the class that student will grasp . a he grow up he will like to impliment the fact by his own . he start think by his own . so learning fact got the importance in application of own idea .
