i agree to the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do and support the following belief of mine with the following view . firstly , being young mean full of energy and the biggest advantage is physiological . a young person is fit and healthy both . this make him to be open to new thing , he experiment , innovates and take risk which brings achievement and sense of accomplishment . the high amount of adreanaline help him to work hard and enjoy harder . secondly , at younger age you have le resposibilities . you dont have child to bother about , you need not to worry about your pension , provident fund and all that , all you bothered about is the present . you have a long way to go and suspense about the future keep you on front foot . thirdly , at younger age you are on the verge to build new relation , you love rain , you love dancing in it , you experince the first touch and get to introduce yourself to a new sensation called love , it make your world colourful , you wait for night to pas on and wait for dusk to get a gilmpse of someone you love . you marry and enjoy the life with your partner , you became social , you became caring and bothered about another person . all this make life more colourful . and when time pass by and you notice physiological change within making you weak , you start worrying about a lot of thing to do before you say goodbye . you fear the ultimate truth ie death approachinhg towards you with a lot of thing which are still pending . you feel either you are running out of time or you have nothing to do and just wait for the judgement day . you are worried about your child and their future . thus , at some time at the later stage you feel that life wa very joyful when you were young therefore i think that young people enjoy life more that old people do .
