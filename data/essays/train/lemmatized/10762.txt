in my opinion the statement is true . if you think about it you will recognize that the risk of failing might be very high but if you want to be successful you have to take a risk . if you just do not try you might regret it later . take madonna a example . she wa one of the first woman in music business who appeard on video not wearing much . people were not used to that way of presenting themselves and there were many discussion about it . many wanted to permit the video and her music . there were a lot of negative article in the world 's press but it also brought her a lot of attention which wa , by the way both , positive and negative . but that wa not the only thing she tried . she also sang about topic like abortion which were tabu at that time . in the end that is what made her famous besides her music . she tried out new thing and risked a lot . she could have failed because you never know if people are ready for it or not but she succeeded . now she is not only one of the most famous musicans of all time but she also earns a lot of money . maybe this is not a typical exmaple if you compare it to people with innovative business idea like henry ford but in my opinion it fit very well with the topic anyways . if she had not tried she might be a well-known artist by now a well but she would probably be one out of many and not the one . all in all everyone ha to decide for him or herself weather he want success or weather he want security and be one of many .
