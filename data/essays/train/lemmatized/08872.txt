there is the arguement whether young people or older people enjoy life the most . some may argue that older people might enjoy life the most , since they think they are getting older and might die soon . but i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do for many different reason . young people want to live life to the fullest , and are willing to experience more than older people . for example the tought of dying is not a present in a young person 's mind a it would be in an older person . therefore the young person is more likely to live the moment and not worry so much in the concequences that it might have in the future . another reason for arguing that young people enjoy life more , is that a younger person is healthier than an older individual . by being healthier the person ha more mobility , and energy to do more activity , and travel around the word . now day there is more technology that young people now how to use to their benefit , making their life easier , leaving more time for entertaining activity , and leasure time . unlike younger people old people 's health a good . as time pass by the body get weaker and loses it strength . there are more older individuasl suffering from a dissease which limitites their mobility , than younger people . older people have more thing to worry about that younger people , such a child and bill . a lot of older people are not used to the technology that is offered now day , therefore most of them might not be encourage to using , and trying new thing . their health , their stronger body , the mentallity , the willing to try new thing , and the technology used by young people . unlike them older people lack of health and are more resistant to try new stuff . and for those are the different reason why younger people enjoy life more than older people .
