i actually disagree with this statement . i 'm a young girl and i want to spend some word supporting boy and girl of my own age , in fact we are not so bad a people say , we spend time doing social work and helping our comunities too . i want to give an exemple : in my own town there are almoust 3,500/4000 person , i live in a small town , but we 've got a several number of old men and woman which need help for house work , doing shopping , having friendly relationship . .. etc . .. because they are alone , maybe without wife or hausband anymore , so a group of young boy and girl , 20 year ago , made a group , the name is `` let 's meet again '' which is made of young people , specifically nephew and niece , that want to spend more time with their grandparent , but also they want to let them meet each other : together we can learn a lot of thing . this group wa working from 1983 , and the most beautifull thing is that old men and woman are very happy to meet new people , to tell story in which they often recognize each other , to have a good time during the weekend ; on the other hand all the young people are very happy and satisfied to learn a lot of new thing of their 's granparents life , of their job , of their love . .. maybe divided by the second world war ! sometimes grandmathers teach u little house work that nobody know anymore and grandfather tell about how strange it wa to get marriage with a woman they absolutly did n't know . .. they are very nice and this is a pretty good way for guy to learn about love relationship . .. they understand how important is to be free to meet a person and to be able to know each other a much a possible before get marriage . i think that this is a way to help a comunity and to do the greatest school of life !
