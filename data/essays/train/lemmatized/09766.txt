the mass production of car started in the past century and ha n't stopped ever since , causing a great deal of problem in term of environmental and social issue . these problem were almost immediately discussed since the early time of the car industry adfirmation . the fordian assembly line model ha been depicted by charlie chaplin in his notorious movie `` modern times '' , and many american pop artist started giving a representation of the american love for car , thing that ha been determined mainly by a social transformation occurred since the fifties : middle class people started moving to the suburb and needed a car to be connected to the city , where their job were usually located , and often also their kid ' school a well . nowadays this kind of sociological and geographical transformation may be witnessed in many different part of the world . urban sprawl and the presence of strip mall are common in many part of italy , germany , france and many other european and asian country a well a in the united states . at the same time civic authorities are not always able to address transportation problem , with the result that most of the people in rich and developing country end up considering their car the principal and favourite of all mean of transportation . in big city and suburb the top user of public transportation are always recent immigrant that do n't own a car yet , and young student . if there 's something that would be able to invert this trend and motivate more people to use their car le , that is the fuel cost that 's getting higher and higher every year . but in my opinion even this would rather lead to a transformation in the kind of fuel used in the future , hopefully sustainable and recyclable , than to a reduction of car user in the world .
