is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific suject they choose ? it is not so easy to say which is more desirable . often it seems to be dependent on the characteristic of the person . but i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge concerning many area than to specialize in one specific subject for the following two reason : firstly no one can reach the full knowledge of every aspect , secondly it is more profitable for each person to study in his or her own area and then share the result . at first , no one grasp the entire knowledge of every subject . what is easy to scientist may not be easy to sociologist . also what is natural to sociologist may not be natural to scientist . we have the limitation of intelligence , thoug we do not have the limitation of interest . so if you try to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , eventually you can find your knowledge very superficial . in addition , it is more desirable for each person to study in his or her own area and then share the result . for example , life scientist concentrate their capacity on studying the system of life . their result help many people who do not know about the system of life . that is more helpful for our society . all thing considered , it is better to specialize in one specific subject thant th have broad knowledge of many academic subject in respect of individual ability and social advantage a well .
