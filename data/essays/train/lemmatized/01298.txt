i potentially disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . first , what i feel is that it 's not the age which determines the level of pleasure or enjoyment in life . it 's basically our attitude toward life which enables u to take the maximum out of what life ha to offer . our outlook towards life is the determining factor for the parameter that we set for enjoying life . secondly , it a matter of committment and perception that win u point in the game of life . for example , an old person having an optimistic approach toward everthing what life ha to offer would rather enjoy stressless leisurely evening sitting in the garden or maybe gardening . in contrast to this a young man having more than half of his life to live could be sitting on a chair in the same very garden and cursing his fate for providing hinderance in his path to success . thirdly , it may be assumed that the younger part of life or the youth age demand more of you but it doe n't mean that a young man simply can not enjoy his life because he is ha more work / assingments to complete . it 's a function of mind game that determines individual perception and it is this perception that fuel u to look towards life in a different plain altogether . i have seen old people like my grandmother enjoy trekking and mountaineering . history , like all other example incorporates one in these term too . we 've had scientist who were old enough to be counted out a non-exciting in general view but but active enough to invent some of the most exciting thing on earth . lastly , the fact that the body may be old enough but it is our mind and will power that combine together to give u a rush of adrenaline even at the age of 70 .
