i agree many young people do not give time to helping their community . in my opinion young people are intersting in many kind of thing which it 's westing time and keeping them away from the responsibalities , a a young man i feel the same thing too , but to fix out this case the goverments , school , university , hospital , any place of activition should stand in one line aginst the un important , unnessary reason that 's keep the young people away and absent , i think the main reason in this case it is the family if the family ecourge , teach them and advise them and push them to the community . so they wont be absent . the community are very important to the young people to share the information and the advise that it could surly help them . every goverment in the world ha a community to keep thier people educated and well enough . but there is alot of entertainment place that can young people weasting there time in . my advise for all young people it 's to feel responsabilty and trying to not weasting time in some thing not deserv .
