travelling around the world is a very interesting and educating experience . in order to fully enjoy the trip , we should decide wether to travel alone or in a group led by a tour guide . actuallty , i prefer such organized tripe rather than travelling by my self for several reason . the first reason is the positive impact of having a tour guide . tour guids are very well educated about the historical , and cultural background of the place the group is visiting . therefore , the tourist get more knowledge and deep explanation of what they see , especially in historical attraction . as the result , the trip becomes much valiable . for example , i travelled to a great historical place in egypt and the tour guide wa very helpful to explain every tiny detail of the temple . i think i would have not been able to get such huge amount of information if i just traveled alone . another advantage of having a tour guide is that he or she can help tourist find good place for shopping by suggesting certain shopping area . the second reason is the advantage of having a group . people from different country , background , and experience are travelling together doe have a positive impact . for example , i had a trip two year ago with a group and i learned alot from them talking about their country and the best place they saw in other trip . i gained valuable inormation about place i wanted to go and had not enough information to help me . moreover , i can benefit from a group rate while going for shopping with the organized trip . the price will be cheaper , so that i can buy more thing . in conclusion , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel . spending the trip withe experienced tour guide a well a a whole group of people , will give a great oppportunity to learn more in an informal and interesting environment . the trip will be diffenitly more valuable if it is spent with such great accompany .
