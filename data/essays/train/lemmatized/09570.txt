today , many people go to many country easily . do you agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ? some people agree with that , but others do not . there are many opinion . personally , i agree with that for several reason . first , people can go to many country and they can enjoy their culture , view and so on . however if we go to travel to other place , we have to study about tha way that how to go to the famous place and everything about the plece what you will go . when i wa a junior high school student , we had a school trip . we went to korea for the school trip . before we go to korea , we had to plan what we want to go . we could have a guide , but we did not , because we thought if we get much information for the traveling , our travel will not be bad situation . we though the information is very good , we will not lost any road . however we losted road . even we could not find ant store which we wanted to go . serching the information by themselves is good thing , but we can not lead the right way always , because the traveling place is not your home town . second , when you go to canada , but you can not speak english what will you do ? tour guide always speak nice english and even speak language which you live in . sometimes people have some trable in the foreign country and they can not solve the problem . if you had a travel like that , you will not be able enjoy the travel later . however when you have a tour guide , it doe not occur . your tour guide will solve the problem clearly and you can enjoy the travel again . in conclusion , tour guide always lead u good way and they will solve our problem easily , so i think it is good for people to have a tour guide .
