i disagree with the statement even thoug i think it is more importan to understand idea and concept . most of the estudents are more concerned about fact because fact can be proved , fact can show you the right and the wrong way to do thing . when you understand the concept and idea is up to you to prove them , to see if they are really what you have been told , i think this is the main reason why student prefere fact rather than just understanding idea and concept . in my opinion tradicional country like mine prefered to teach idea and concept so tha you can developed a you want , in the other hand more developed contries prefere to teach fact that you can put easally in practice and you dont have to spend time triyng to proved if thing work right or wrong . one of the major reason developed contries teach fact is the value of the time , time ha become a treasure that you have to improve , time go fast and cost money . understanding idea and concept will leave you the main idea , the estructure the formation , is up to you to thake advantage of this an try to developed an take in to fact of your own experience . facts are really imoportan and if you now how to use them you will have more argument to deal wiht live
