to be successful , we need some challenge and new idea to attract people attention on what is being developped . in fact , bill gates who is the richest man in the world ha been able to do so by developping it idea of computer , which is being use around the world a a communication tool . by doing so with some friend , he is not only ha the copy right , but also he ha put the world in a new era : rapid communication . since he wa the only one with this new idea , anyone else who need to use it product ha to buy his right or product . if he were someone who wa afraid to take risk , he will not drop out of school to pursue it dream . life in itself is a risk . we , a human , need to go forward by deeping in our vast background knowledge to determine for example the cause of cancer and a way to prevent or cure it . we have the knowledge . but we need to take risk to spend some time and money to discover some new formula and save the world . for example , when you open a guiness book , only people who have invented a new product or come with the origina ideal or attend what wa never beed reached before are in it . it never mention anywhere the second or the third . appollo is an example . until today , i can not remember the second person who wa on the moon . if you do something every body , you miss the `` wow '' effect . people will not be focus on your work because it si already on the market . however , they will welcome your new idea , finance it if needed , and be ready to buy it . therefore , risk taker are the best way to succeed .
