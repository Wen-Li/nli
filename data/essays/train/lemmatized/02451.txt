some people try new thing and take risk , while others only do what they already know how to do . only doing what one already know is a safe way . however , i believe that trying to do new thing is always better . first , it is beneficial to try for new thing because by doing so , one can learn and therefore hone him or herself . if one were to repeat doing what he or she already know how to do well , that would be boring and there is no opportunity for him or her to learn , or find new thing . second , it is always fun to get to know new thing , and especially when one mastered , there is a great fulfillment . even when one fails to be successful , he or she can always set new goal for it and sharpen his or herself , and eventually be successful . the same idea can be used on skateboarding . if one were to only do what he or she already know and repeat them all over , there is nothing more he or she can do , which would make it extremely boring . however , by trying out for new trick or move that one ha not yet done , he or she might be able to find something new that would not only help him or her make that trick , but also on other skill . when he or she eventually learns it , there is a great fulfillment and happiness . by trying to do what one ha never done before , he or she can train his or herself , learn new thing , and feel accomplishment . even if there are risk , one can learn something by failing and eventually be successful . from these benefit , which can never be gained from repeating what one already know how to do well , it can be concluded that trying new thing is always better .
