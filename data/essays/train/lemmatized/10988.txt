i agree with the idea that now a day young people do not give enough time to help their community . i feel this true atleast in my country . in olden day during freedom struggle many young people felt it is their resposibility to help their country to regain it glory . this can demonstrated from the fact that most of the national leader at that time had a very good record in helping the community when they were young . may be it is because they are very enthusiastic or may be the condition demanded them to do so but they definitely spent more time in helping community than modern day guy . now a day young people have become more lazy mainly because the hard ship faced by the people over the period of time ha reduced and that they generally do n't face the hard condition faced by the people in earlier time . more over with the advencement of entertainment industry the young people have found a way to kill their leasure time there by not bothering about the thing that are happening around them . more over with the advencement of importance of study now a day young people often get preoccupied in their own problem finding it difficult to care about problem faced by the community . but they are not realising by neglecting the community they are neglecting them self . the point that people are neglecting their community can be demonstrated by the point the number of strike against bad government policy ha reduced over a period of time . so i say that now a day people dont give enough time to help their community and by doing so they are spoiling them self and also the community . i finally say that people should spend more time for community a did by their predissors
