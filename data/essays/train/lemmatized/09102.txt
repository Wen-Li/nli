some theory predict that in the next twenty year there will be a decrease in the number of the car in use . i am not sure that this will be the future , but there are many reason that suggest me that it would be a possible scenario . the first main raison is the energitical problem . everyone know that oil energy , based on petroleum , might be reduced in the next year and if the fuel for car is rare , there will be not car , or at least the cost of petrol will be too high to mantain a car . not everyone who today ha got a car , might be able to afford these high expense . the second point that indicates me a possible reduction of car is related to the pollution . i live in milan , a big city in the north of italy , where the quality of the air is very low because of car . thus , it is raisonable to think that to solve this the government might forbid the circulation of car in the city . if it is happens , the number of car will , certainly , decrease . finally the tecnology evolution allows to think that in the next future the need of car will be lower and lower . an example come into mind . in the past everyone had a horse to move , instead now nobody need a horse because there are car . in the same way , in twenty year there will be other mean of transport faster than car . in conclusion there are three good reason to think that the reduction of car is
