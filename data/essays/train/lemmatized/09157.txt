some people agree that young people enjoy life more then older people do because of vast energy that young people have , while some people claim that age is not important for enjoyable life because every part of life ha it own enjoyement . after consedering this question , according to my age and personal view , i agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do . first of all young people 's physical condition provide them to make different kind of sport such a snow-boarding , squba diving . therefore i believe that young people can have more exciting hobies . they can travel or explore different place so i advocate that it is the very important part of good life . additionally young people 's energy help them to reach their goal easier they can work harder and can obtain greater career . secondly mental tireness make older people to lost motivation or expectation from the future . young people ha energy to try to solve problem or put up with them . thus i advocate that this energy is the foundation of having enjoyable life . last but not least while individual are young they have a temptation to taste different food or to meet different people . for this reason happiness and enjoyement are directly linking age and this temptation . all in all i agree with the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because young peple including myself have more energy in term of mental or physical .
