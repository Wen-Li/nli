there are several viewpoint on , `` is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one '' . both view have their own individual pro and con . there are so many aspect to consider . let me explain some aspect in the following passage . first consider , having broad knowledge of many academic subject . by knowing all these subject we have alot of advantage . we can have a good future , good knowledge on all subject . .. etc . by knowing all subject we can have a future in any field . we can have alot of choice to earn money . you never feel any difficulty in life regarding subject knowledge . for example , let me tell you about my profession . i am a architectural student . if i learn autocad , photosho - p , 3dmax . . etc . with these i can have more future option . thus i can earn alot of money in different field . these have some problem . i prefer advantage should always be greater than disadvantage second let me explain about knowledge in one specific subject . this can help in someways . we can have good future , money in that subject . even one can become researcher , who help society in alot of way . from that way one can earn money . for example , let me tell you about my profession . if i have indepth knowledge in designing and construction of building , i can settle down a a architect and i can create magic . the main problem is if i do n't get a chance to proove myself , i ca n't earn money . if we consider the other side of the statement , it is having so many problem thereby we can not have much knowledge about everything , we have to fix in one field . i am inclined to support both position because both have their own view . however , i suggested more towards having knowledge in many academic than in onme specific one . so , i agree in part with the statement .
