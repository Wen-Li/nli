gone are the day when grandparent were taken in charge by their child . a lot of people are nowadays under the impression that young people are le and le helping their community . however , in the view of the actual situation we can say that the community life ha deeply changed . thus , i think that young people are a involved in this community life a before , but in a different way . firstly , we must consider the every day life of the young people , which enable them to help their community . for example , there are a lot of job that are directly related to the community . the growing part of ageing people in our society brings out a need of assistance , this trend generates job , which can be considered a helping the community and are really favoured by unemployed young people . this way of helping is all the greater a it is supported by the government : it created some job of educator in suburb . these job are designed for young people they know well this environnment , and are really helpful for their community . secondly , there are a lot of young people who are working a volunteer in caritative association : for example , a lot of student want to give a sense to their life by this way . some french caritative association like emmaus or secours populaire are now overcrowded by volunteer who want to act for social reinsertion of homeless people . the recent demonstration of young people in france also demonstrate that they want to be concretely involved in the evolution of their society . this fundamental possibility and this political awareness show their great desire to help their community . the young people are currently helping their community in a different way than before : they are now quite independent , and they are no more asked by their parent for help . nevertheless , they choose to be involved in association or they favour job that are useful for the community .
