in my opinion , i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well becase of creating a chance to be success and possibility of sucess . first of all , if i am doing what i were already getting used to , i could never get a chace to make a lot of money or to sharply developed by myself because i would think same way and situation . when we see a sucessful people , they tried several aspect and a lot of way with the risk . for example , i went to a seminar which donald triump opened in new york city two week ago , i heard that only people who catch a good idea and chance with risk can be sucessed . moreover , if i try to get new thing , i believe i have more percentage of development . there is an article pressed by korea times in 2006 that introduced a man graduated from seoul university in korea with bechelor degree sell a sandwich and kimbab ( korean sushi ) . he make more than $ 100,000 per a year . therefore , i firmly believe that in order to get new chance and good idea and grow up my possiblity of sucess , i should try new thing and creative experience . that is why i agree with that .
