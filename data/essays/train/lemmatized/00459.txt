sucecesful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . trying new thing and taking risk are the significant part of the succes ' i completely agree with this idea and my argument for that point are listed a follows firstly , humanbeing ha been trying many new thing since the initial day of the life this is the source of the improvement , for instance the telephone is invented by graham bell , why ? because he wa looking for a nwe thing which he need in his life and it wa completely new thing maybe he took risk because it wouldnt be a succesfsful device and after the bell we communication improved and for the present there are mobile phone in our life also mobile phone wa the new thing before 5 year but now we are looking for some new thing . . admittedly graham bell is a succesful person because he tried new thing and took risk secondly , being stable is like a death , movement is the foundationstone of the world . hence the person who doesnt perform anything in his life ha to fall down ` for instance foreign language i have been learnin italian for 2 year , at first it wa a new idea for me and i took a risk because of the limited speaking region of italian but i spend many time to learn it and for the present i am working in italian company , i am not sure that if i am succesful person but exactly it effected my carrier . to sum up ; succesful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . because they know that the world never stop even is known how to turn arround it .
