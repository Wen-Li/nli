i do not agree with the following statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . '' my definition of `` traveling '' would be feeling the breeze and have relaxation , but with tour guide i would not feel comfortable at all . from my experience i went to yellowstone national partk withing a group led by a tour guide . it wa very helpeful to learn about yellowstone national park but they had limited time , so if i want to go somewhere to see more informationa or to take a picture i would not have time because we would have to move on to next place , i did not have any individual time to spend with my family . all i did wa walking and listening , walking and listenning over and over again . i felt like this wa more like school field trip not traveling . of course you can counterpoint with my decision , like what if you do n't know the direction or you have no idea what to do ? well i thought about that too but the whole point of traveling is you look for direction and find the place and keep searching for new thing . i got lost several time during my trip but it wa all worth it because next time i went there i could remember clearly because i got lost once and now i think about that moment i think it 's good memory to have . i 'm not saying that you should not have a plan for your trip but with tour guide you schedule is going to be so tight that you will not have anytime to have your own quality time , all you do is sleep at night because you are so tired from touring . in conlcusion the best way to travel is to travel by yourself or your friend but not in a group led by a tour guide , it will make the trip worse .
