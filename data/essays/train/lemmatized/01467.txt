i disagree with this statement , although i wa thinking the same way when i wa a teenager . when i wa about sixteen , i regarded my grandmother sitting in her little kitchen and thought that she wa not admireable because of her old age and health problem . in my opinion in these time , only young people were able to have fun , because they got the body fitness which allowed them to swim in lake , ride a bike and dance during the whole night at a party . but today , i oppose this opinion very harshly . now i know , that every step in the human life ha it advantage . when you are young , without doubt the ability in enjoying life is based on sport and fun , a i just mentioned . you do not care about any sorrow or any severe plan for future . so this seems to be the only time in life , where you are able to live without fear . but when you grow older , you are able to regard problem in life from a more abstract or distinct point of view , you are wiser and able to differ between severe and unimportant problem . when i talk to my grandmother today , i learn that the joy in her life is linked to the joy of her famliy , especially with her child she raised . instead of taking care of her child , she now is able to see her effort and ha more time for herself . now she travelles to her sister several time a year , which she could not afford in time when she wa raising her child . it is true that the responsibility for one action grows parallel to the growing of the age , but also the joy in taking this responsibility grows . as an adult one is able to deal with responsibility , which offer lot of new challenge . these challenge not only are important milestone in development , but they can also be a huge joy . for example , to found a family , marry a wife and raising child with her , without doubt is a huge responsibility , but it can also be the greatest fun in one life . to draw a conclusion , young people do not enjoy life more than older people do , the only enjoy life in a different way .
