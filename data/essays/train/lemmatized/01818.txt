it is often said that the younger do not have many time for helping their society . some people disagree with this statement because the younger have a time to help others for their benefir such a finding job and decrease their tax . however , i firmly believe that the younger do not have time to help community because they have time to study and they are learned from parent because winning in society of completing since they are young . to begin with , the younger do not spend time to help other because university and school suggest many home material and homework . according to the ministry of education , 12.4 % of student have time to help society and most of these people invest time for findinf job and improve their grade . for example , dongjin , my friend , do not have time to help the older but he have no time to invest helping older because his berden is very largy in unversity that suggest many report and project . moreover , many people have been learned by their parent to win in completing society , especially in korea . that make people prohibit to help other . according to chosun-ilbo , one of the famouse newpaper in korea . 65.3 % of basic student study middle student level for win the friend . so they do not have time to behave others such a helping the older and blinder . jung-jion , my friend , is learned by their parent to study for winning . in conseqence , he entranced good universitry and find good job and know only success and improve his level . however , his life is dry and he doe not have friend . in contrast , billgates , ceo of microsoft , invest for poor people , he get the money and status . in brief , i agree with the idea that the younger do not spend time to help their community because of their burden of univeristy and accepting teaching since they are young .
