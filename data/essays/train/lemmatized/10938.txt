nowadays , environnemental problem are the road map of many policy across the world and in each country . the main cause is the important presenc eof car on the earth , which are polluating the atmosphere rejecting toxic product into . several country started to apply their policy to protect environnement , reducing the use of oil by public and private transport , and trying to find solution to remplace the use of car . however , the car is the most useful mean of transport and we ca n't assume than car will be fewer in twenty year . cars are well-knew to pollute atmosphere and to be a source of toxic product . to decrease the pollution by car , some government asked people to use their own car only when it is a big necessity . in big city , authority promoted public transport reducing their price and urging people to travel by bus , subway , bike or tramway . many area of city became forbidden to car , limitating the use of car in pedestrian zone . moreover , scientist are trying to find an other source of energy to transport , like electricity . in big city for example , we can see some bus which are working with electricity to reduce pollution , and the use of car . besides , people are more and more concerned by environnement and pollution , and start to be interested by the future of the earth . they try to part in the reduction of toxic emission , travelling by bus or subway in big city or travelling with their friend to go to work an using only one car for several people . good citizen make effort to improve their way of life and they care about their health . the price of oil getting worsen , people may realize that it is better to travel by public transport than to spend money for oil . however , i think it is to early to say that in twenty year there will be fewer car than today . if people and governements are making effort and are trying to reduce the number of car , they remain a very good way to travel for people : they can go where they want , when they want , and it 's free ( exept the oil ) . public transport remain quite expensive for people who prefer travel by themselves , in their own space , and not melting with others people . moreover , if car is not so useful in town , it is in the countryside and to holiday , because plane or train are much more expensive than car . thus , i really think that people are not ready to rid of their car , which is their main way of transport . to conclude , i am not really sure than the number of car will be le important in twenty year than today , because others way of transport and public service are still too expensive . cars are very useful , and it is difficult for people to imagine their daily life without them . in the other hand , country are getting more and more worried about the price of oil and are acting to remplace car , but it will take time .
