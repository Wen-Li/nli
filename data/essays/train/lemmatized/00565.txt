i agree whit the answer . my opinion is that car is very important for the people , for the live of people , because the moder people use the car for live . thay use the car for going to work , school , holyday , for spend a good time in the near city . .. twenty year old ther wa le people and the people used other transport for moving , and the prize for buy a car is very big for the normal people . only few people can buy the car . today the prize is le and many people can buy . today the industrian produce a lot type of car for any type people and any type use , thus any people can buy the very good car for yous life / job . now i would also like a draw your attention for the use that the moder people doing of yours car . the problem is not how lot car there is , but how may using car ! the moder people wrong using a car . the government give a possibility to use an other instrumen for travele , there is an airplain for the long long travel , there is a train for a long travel or bus for short travel , but the moder people prefore using a car , why ? because the car is more confortable . . but is mor expensive for the people , petrol is carefull , and for the comunity , the heart is ill . when ther people know this the people change the type of yours live , i think that thay continus to buy a car , is important , i think that there is one car for any family . . for the emergence , but if the people using le the car the cost for the comunity will be lesat . few people know this but thay , for now , do not change your comportamnt . .. i hope thay do this . . in a future .
