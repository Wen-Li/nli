having knowledge is always good . knowledge give u culture and also show u different point of view about thing . i think it is better to know about many subject than just know about one in particular . people live in a society and interact with other people . in my opinion , the only way to understand people is to know about them . when you have the knowledge about a variety of subject , you have a wider mind and it is easier to understand people 's behavior in almost any situation . if you are a doctor , for example , you need to know about your patient ' behavior . you need to talk to them when they are in pain . it is easier for you if you have studied psichology , for instance . so , it is better if you have knowledge not just in medicine . knowledge about different subject give u culture and can be helpul in some case . it allows u to know about art , literature , and many other subject that are important for our character . if we study art and literature , we can be more creatives . if we study technology , we can repair some appliance at home . it is practical to know about different subject . in my opinion , the more we know , the more complete person we are . if we have time , it is better to study different subject than just one . in this way we can easily interact with the people , we can be more creative and , at the same time it can be usefuf for our daily activity . as a conclusion , we are learning everyday about different subject . it is good to do it for our own good .
