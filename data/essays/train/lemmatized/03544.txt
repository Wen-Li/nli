i do agree with the opinion expressed in the statement . in every day life is it possible to hear statement like that . simple statement not deriving for philosophical thought , just simple expression of every day life 's observation . i think that is possible to explain such a cliche ' giving some example that truly confirm the point . young people have more time than adult to enjoy their life . usually young people go to school and have the opportunity to meet people of their age . sharing school-time make young people eager to play sport together , to go out at night together and enjoy life . adults usually have to think of their family , they usually work to earn the money necessary to feed their child and so they have le time to do what they want . adults actually do not have time to enjoy life . even if the adult is a rich person he ha not the possibility to organize his life independently of his or her responsabilities . as you become older you have more to accomplish in order to respect what people expect from you . what i have just written could be contrasted adfirming that young people enjoy life because they do not know what life is . young people can not see the hidden difficulty that everyone experience in his life . but we all know that sometimes is good not to know everything . i could give also a personal example , when i wa ichild life seemed easy to me , i thought that could become everybody i wanted to , but now i know that real life is different . to reach want you want to reach you need to forget sometimes friend , sport , and all other thing that could help enjoing life . as we all know , it is necessary for an adult person to find in his accomplishment and in his work the source of life enjoyment . if an adult learns to understand which are the important thing in his life then he or she will enjoy life .
