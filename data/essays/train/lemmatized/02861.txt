people have their own idea about whether young people give enough time to contribute to their society . some people might say young generation would like to help their community , since they can experience a variety of thing . however , in my opinion , it seems clear that young people do not give enough time for helping their community ; they are too busy and they are affected by biased information . first , young people ha too mush work to do . it is generally agreed that a society is getting compex , young people are too busy to develope themselves . therefore they would not have much time to care for their community , for example , one of my friend like to do a favor to others so he got a prize from the principal of his school . however , since he ha to prepare for applying to the university he want to go , he can not give enough time to helping other people . in this way , being busy is a great obstable to helping our communites . second , a far a multi-media is concerned , young generation are only concern about themselves . some people might say the multi-media ha nothing to do with being selfish . however , through the multi-media such a television , student are informed that most of people in our community doe n't need help , so they do not bother to do a favor to our community . for instance , the tv drama nowadays tend to show u only the partial weatly class of our society to get our attention , making young people think most of people do not need any attention . therefore , the influence the multi-media prevents young generation from helping our communites . to sum up , young people nowadays tend not to help our society in that they ha too busy to qualify themselves and they are getting distored information about their community . all thing considered , i think young generation tend not to do a favor to our community .
