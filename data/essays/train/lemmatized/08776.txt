`` there is no substitute for hardwork '' this is the praise that the successful people do follow in their life . so taking these aspect into concern , i strong agree that successful people should try out for new thing in their life eventually . since i agree that successful people have gained enough knowledge from the society to live through , and at the same time their experience in success would definetly useful to be put up in other aspect , which is very much essential for the people of the next generation , which would pave the path for them to enlight them in that particular field . these people should definetly try out for the new thing by handling the risk rather than doing the thing which they are familiar with , these people gain a lot of knowledge from their carrer . if they are failed once they need to try out for that untill they succeed . failures are the stepping stone of success so they need to try out for new thing , that would give another sought of experience which will be very encouraging for these people . so what ever may be the project you are going to take take that project a avery worthful for you then you can be succeeded . if the person is experienced in all the aspect of life then he can come out with flying colour . so i would conclude by saying that successful people should try out new thing rather than handling the thing which he already known to him . `` be dare take risks nothing can substitute experience ''
