i , agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young child enjoy their life to a full extant . they dont have any responsibility on them . they play and have fun with their friend . they dont have any burden and are usually stress free . they are always with smiling face and by looking at them any one can be relieved from their tension . they are always joyful , they try to entertain others through their fun filled play . they always are very creative and quick at imagining thing . they usually pose some question which parent some time feel in answering . they try to explore new thing with thing around them with their creative mind . they usually like story of commics , and story of tale through which they can know what is good and what is bad . they love watching cartoon because they feel them to be funny , they also learn lot from those cartoon . some are very much interested in game . they play lot of fun filled game . they can refresh their mind and also do excersice to their brain and body if they are very good at game , they can also participate in national level game and bring honour to their school and family . they can also participate in many cultural event that take place in school or in their neighbour hood . by this they can entertain people . and also entertain themselves . they feel very happy for their small success . but , older people because of their hectic life and too many responsibility dont have enough time to enjoy to a full extant . they hardly get time during weekend to enjoy with family . they can refresh their mind only in the night after coming from their office by listening to music and by watching television . so , yonger people enjoy life more than older peole , a they have much leisure time and are not usually burdened with too much responsibility .
