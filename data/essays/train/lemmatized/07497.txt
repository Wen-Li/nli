on the one hand , having a broad knowledge of many academic subject can be a tremendous asset because we can say when we apply for a job that we are polyvalent . this is well valued by employer because we will be able to evoluate in many different field , service in the firm . many business school deliver marketing , financial , linguistic skill which can be used in different post in a firm . and this is a security for student who do not have a specific project for the future . but after all those advantage , there is one major drawback which is that the student only know few thing about many subject . indeed , only basic skill can be treated when this is not a specialized subject . so the student will be penalize against a specialized student . on the other hand , to be specialized in one specific subject is the best choice for student who have a clear idea of what job they want to exerced in the future . they can say to the employer that they are the best in one particular subject . this is very good way to apply for a job . firms need the best . multinational firm put in competition student over the world , so being specialized in finance when you want to apply for a job at price water and house is required . its is impossible for someone who have only basic skill in audit . the disadvantage is that if the company want to put u in an other service , which is not our specialisation , we will have to do training , formation , or at least to learn alone with our own experience . this is more stressful and very risked . so this a thorny problem for a student . to tackle this issue , we have to compare the strenghts and weakness of each education like i have done . there is one solution adapted to each case . then , we have to know if a job in specific interest u . if this is the case , we have to specialized in the subject appropriated to apply for this job . anyway , in our study , we are never totally specialized in something . there is always a few basic skilled mastered . and this is a good thing because polyvalence if very appreciated by employer .
