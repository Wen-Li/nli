humankind always need knowledge to reach goodlife standarts . therefore knowledge is a very important aspect of a person 's life . there are different point of view about the type of knowledge what people should have . firstly some people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . in contrary to those some think that specializing in one specific subject is better . i personally agree with the first idea depending on three reason . first of all , person with a broad knowledge of many academic subject would have more job opportunity than a person who is specified in one subject . secondly , i think that people should be aware of what is going on in the world for being an intellectual person . the last , but not least , if someone want to have a deep , rich conversation he should be able to know about a lot information about the life . first of all , a person with a broad knowledge of many academic subject would have more job opportunity than a person who is specified in one subject . for example you are a businessman and you manage a business . if you want to hire a employee to your marketing department and you have two choice . first one is a guy with specific and exact information about marketing sector and there is other choice , he know about both marketing and computer a well a communication . which one would you prefer ? secondly , i think that people should be aware of what is going on in the world wide on the way of being an intelligence person . therefore we could have much opportunity of communicating , applying any kind of job , being speakable and etc . the last , but not least , if someone want to have a deep , rich and wide conversation that person should be able to know about a lot of information about the enviroment , life and the world wide . therefore he could have many topic to talk on doe not matter who he want to speak . if he get with a dentist he should be able to know about the teeth , like brushing it , caring it or how to fix if you have a problem about it . therefore the person would have many friend and be much more attractive to the people in his enviroment all in all , a i said before people should have broad knowledge of many academic subject for both having more opportunity for job and being an intelligence person a well a getting more friend and being able to have a conversation with anyone he like to . as i mentioned above i am trying to improve myself in every topic that i could be able to gain information about it . by doing this i am believing that i could reach goodlife standarts and have much more friend . therefore i will always try to improve myself in every topic that i could get to know of .
