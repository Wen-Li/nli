the issue at hand is that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject or to specialize in one specific subject . the issue is important , because specialist are nerrow viewed people , who can hardly transfer knowladge from one subject to an other , and because of that who are limited within their academic subject . therefore , i beleave that it is better to be a generalist than a specialist . at first , the generalist have a brider view of their academic subject , which allows them to transfer knowledge from other field . since they have knowledge about different subject in one field , they can transfert knowledge from one field to the next in order to solve existimg problem faster . hance , specialist on the other hand can not do that , which support my opinion that being a generalist is better then being a specialist . an other point ist that , generalist are able to compare and contrust different subject in a field . therefore , have many more inspiration field than a specialist , which allow rhen to improve the . this is an other reason why i think that specialist are better in a sence they are more successful . as last , generalist are not restricted with the boundries of their field of study like the generalist . they have the opportunity to improve their knowledge in different dicertions and aven afters jears of study , they still can improve their knowledge in their field of studu . generalist on the other hand , are strictyly capselt in their world , which hold them back of improvement . because specialist are restricted and close to improvement after some time of study , i thing that being a generalist is better . as a conclution , i believe that being a generelist meand having a bride view , being able to transfere knowledge between different subject - in order to solve probles in faster way - and having the opprtunity to improve yourself , which make it better than being a specialist .
