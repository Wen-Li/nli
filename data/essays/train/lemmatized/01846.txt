i think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . there are many important motif to support my personal idea . first , a broad knowledge of many academic subjesct is important to introduce a person in the work enviroment terminate the university study , because that garanted many possibility that one that have specialize in one specific subject . second , a knowledge of many subject garanted to have a good culture preparation and is a satisfaction for myself and is important in everyday life . i have allready frequented the university and i think that when i begin to work if i find a good job perhaps i have to specialize in one specific subject attend specific course after work or in the weekend , but at the moment i think that is better to have broad knowledge of more subject a possible .
