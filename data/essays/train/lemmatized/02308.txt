the conclusion that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , sound correct to me . there are two argument that are interesting to consider in evaluating the conclusion above . first , if we assume that college and university are currently using the best strategy and tool to teach student , it is clear that concept and idea are fundamental and more important then fact to build the basic knowledge of student . in fact , at engineering university all the course in the first couple of year are about algebra , geometry and phisics . all of those course are about idea and concept ; no one of them refers to fact or application . by learning idea and concept , student can develop ability of reasoning and thinking that in the future they will need to solve real problem and to understand fact . second , it is much more worthwhile studying generalitazion rather then specific application . in fact , in our real world it is unbelievable to know everything about fact and memorize them . instead , idea and general concept can be applied everywhere and help to understand every fact . moreover , our world is running so fast that scientist and researcher discovery every day new thesis and model . if a student know how to deal with abstract idea and concept , he or she can easily understand every thing is new and ha came up in our world . facts ate constrained by context and circumstance and are very useful to fix and remember idea and concept . in conclusion , student must understand firstly idea and concept . it is helpful for reasoning and thinking ability a well a for understanding fact .
