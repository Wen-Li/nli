i agree with this statement . in my opinion only learning fact will help you to pas an test , and maybe get a good result , but for your later life you | ll not be able to understand relation or process which are necesary in many field . but for area of knowledge which are not needed in my further life , learning fact and finishing a test is ok , in all other case you have to know | how it work | . for example if you | re studying for a technically grade you | ll have to understand , why physical law are working and how . it doesn | t make sense to know the fact , if you | re not familar with the basic understanding you | ll not be able to create new electronic circuit or work in the field of research & development . also in mathematics if you not able to understand | phytagoras | ... or differential-calculations it make no sense to goon for deeper knowledge in this field . furthermore there will be no test , which you | ll pas without presenting that you familiar with this thing . also in my life i experienced , that if i will get a detailed knowledge in some area i have to understand the simple and basic concept , without this understanding it | s not possible to go on .
