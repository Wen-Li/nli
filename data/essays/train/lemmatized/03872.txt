look around you , there are so many successful people . they come in various `` shape and form '' . the shape and form being , the circumstance ( let 's face it , luck play a `` minor '' role ) , the personality of the person and what the individual is successful in . however , there is one common thing among all them successful folk , they are absolutely focused . they know what they want , and when they want it . they also take risk , something not all of u have the capability to do . they are no doubt good at what they do , however the risk is the key factor . people who are successful are inded very clever . they know what they want , they know how to get what they want . what make them different from unseccessful people is the latter ; how they get what they want . risk taking is one of them . they are no doubt very good at what they do , this is what give them the confidence to go ahead and take that risk . for instance , i play badminton , and the best player on our school team is successful at badminton . he is alos arrogant in his belief , however , it is his belief that have gotten him so far with the game . he take risk while playing a match that is very hard core and intense . plaing with him is a very scary prospect because his stratergies to win are such . he let 's the opponets gain a couple point , so that they become over confident and then systematically go about gaining back point and eventually beating them . now , for an amateaur like me , this is anything but comforting . what if they become so confident that they actually are better than you are ? this question he never answer because he is convinced his theory will will work , no matter what . he is successful , i consider him so . he know the game so well and he watch his oppensts so well that he can manipulate the attitude of his opponent . this could be an example of a successful person . it 's his risk that make him part of what he is .
