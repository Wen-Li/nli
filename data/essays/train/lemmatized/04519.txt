some of the company use advertisement to sell their product . i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i support my view with following reason and example . first , advertisement give visual view to people . especial to the young child , a lot of food product are used the catoon image and toil to attract the kid . when the kid see their favorite character , they will request the parent to buy that certain food regarless the taste and health . for example , the restaurant advertise for the free toil if you buy one set of kid meal including frech fry . the food is not healthy , but the kid love it because of the free gift . second , advertisement tell you the result of the product . i have seen many weight lost product such a tea , and protein diet , etc . .. the tv commercial display the product with a woman who ha loose weight such kilogram after using this typical product . they also show the womam 's contrasted picture before and after using it . control weight is determined not only about your diet , but also your healthy lifestyle . for example , le fat consumption and more frequently excercise are better pratice for your body than just taking lost product . in conclusion , some of the adervertisements have more attraction than product themselves .
