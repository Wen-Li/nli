i think that there is no real decrease in the amount of time that young people are dedicating to help their comunities nowadays compared to what wa usual in the past . as far a i am regarded , what really ha changed is the way people , and youngster a well , contribute to the life of their community . until le than one century ago the family wa the center of the comunity and most of the social need where covered trough the help of the family member . for example , if we think about the care of elderly people , it wa almost entirely carried out by family member , thereby reducing the need for help from the surrounding community . of course this required all the family member , also young people , to take an active role in the family life . nowadays is not the same anymore and in order to have the same `` service '' is required an higher involvement of the community , since the family , having changed so much , is no more able to take care of the same function and require support from outside . this mean that there is a greater need for volunteering inside the community but at the same time pepole should be able to dedicate more time to the community , a they are required to do le within the family . the same is true for young people , who are in fact active in a lot of field . i myself wa for several year a volunteer for an hiking club , and devoted most of my sunday from spring to fall to lead group of kid to the mountain to discover nature . some of my friend have been involved in care of elderly people and some other are volounteering for the red cross . of course those occupation are not taking all of the available spare time of young people , there is always the chance to do a little bit more , and there are some who are not contributing at all , but i think that there is no real ground to say that young people in general are not helping enough . most of them are doing their best to help out .
