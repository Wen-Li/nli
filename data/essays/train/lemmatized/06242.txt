in general speaking , a lot of people love new thing , especially young peole . i suppose that everyone need ambisious feeling for many thing , therefore i agree with that successful people should try new thing even there are some risk . for example , there is one successful person with art , and he already ha a lot of job belonging art . but one day , he really interested in to be auther . however , if he quit his job now , he can not avoid from the position of the person who ha no job . in this case , he ha to think carefully about his future first , and then , if he really want to be auther even there are some risk , he should be the auther . however , he ha to efforrt to be the auther very much . if he notice that he shoul not to be the auther later , and there are no job , it is his responsibility . it wa good for him to notice that he should continue his job same a before . if someone who want to try new thing even there are some risk , they should try . there are no experoles of own life only doing what they already know how to do well . even the people who love to dong only one thing , they might had a time to think
