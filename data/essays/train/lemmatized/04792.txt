yes i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . because in this janration thay are so many way for enjoying thamself . young people have so many thing to use for enjoy tham self . i think that whan the older people are playing some game with their firends but young people are playing game both type like thay are using computer game & also play with their friend . young people have so many fasility to anjoy them self . whan the young people have to enjoy them self than thay go for movi on multiplax , thay want to play than play on play station 3 , computergames etc.if the young jonration does't have any friend that way also enjoy alone but older people did't have any instrument or any game to play alone . now young people have so many way to make a friend like a surffing on a net mean chatting on net to go for helth club , for sport club like so many place to make a friend or enjoy them self . now the world become smaller so young people are trying to make them self best for good in education thay are going for study to abroad . young people are also trying to make themself good and important people for them self . i will give you one simpal exam that just now i have my personal computer , personal car for tranportion me.but my father does't have their personal car to use so this type pf differants on t i am not saying that tha old people are not enjoying tham self . oldpeople also enjoyin himself like paly with all street friend . thay are also enjoying festivel togater and enjoy them self . so both people are anjoying them self but a i my opinean young people enjouing life than older people do .
