there is a prediction that car usage will decline in the future for several reason . firstly , it is getting expensive to own and use a car . scarcity ha driven the price for oil and the raw material for manufacturing of car up to an almost unacceptable level . also , car usage add onto the already serious air pollution and global warming problem with their exhaust . the economical and environmental reason encourage people to switch to a cheaper and cleaner mode of transportation - the mass transportation . however , i believe that there will not be significantly fewer car in use twenty year from now on . firstly , with the rise of many third world country such a china and india , many more individual will be able to replace their cheaper vehecles , such a bicycle and motorcycle , with car . not only because of the luxury , they will be able to travel to further place more frequently . economic advancement also encourage research on greener energy . in the future , car with inbuilt solar panel may become the major vehicle on the road . besides using solar energy , a greener way of travelling can also be achieved with reduction in car size . there may be option varying from one seat personal car to six seat family mini van . the lack of metal for car manufacturing can also be solved with technology . researches on strong material such a carbon nanotube may serve to replace today 's steel sheet . cars , just a many other item we have in modern lifestyle , provides u with tremendous convenience . yet , they bring about problem that may one day lower our quality of life . however , instead of escaping , we should confront the problem with better solution . hence , there will be more car instead of fewer , just greener and smaller , twenty year later .
