in order to give a complete response , could be useful to distinguish between two category of teaching : training and formation . we can call training every kind of teaching that want to make you learn how to do something . good example of training could be the driving school . the formation is used to provide to the student general idea , that can influence their way of thining and approaching to a problem . of couse exaple of formation are in the school and in university . according to this distinction i think that for a student that is doing a training , is more useful to learn fact , meaning with fact previous experience made by someonelse or a specific way to do something . for the student that go in a school or in an university , is more important to understand idea , that are the basis of a coherent way of thinking . the different importance that i give to the idea and to the fact , in the two different kind of learning is strongly connected to the target of the learning . infact if we , for example , want to learn how to drive a car or a truck , and the getting of the target is obviusly shown by the the grade of ability that we get in driving , the experience of someone or a specific series of action is more useful than an abstract concept . of course the opposite appen with a subject in tha school or in the university . finally i could say that because of there are a lot of target in what we want to teach , is not correct to speak about one best way to teach , and what are the main concept that we have to learn , but we have to fit our personal interest to what we need from a class or a seminary .
