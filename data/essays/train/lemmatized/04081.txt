the best way of travelling with a group of people is very funny and i really enjoy that trip . actually we do n't know the place we are going to visit at that time we really need a person who guide u . but we are going in a group at that time we do n't want a guid . in our group some people knew about the place , and someone in the group have some information about the place then no need to worry . for example , i went to hawaii with my friend , in my friend group one girl already visited the hawaii and she knew the place which is more beautiful and which place we can really enjoy and she also know some resturant . at that time we went to hawaii and we really enjoyed the trip . we do n't need any guide . if iam going alone at that time i really do n't know the place then i need a guide . if i can not take a guide then i wo n't enjoy the trip . but in my opinon i enjoyed the trip when i went with my friend in group . group trip with friend is really enjoyableand i could still remember those trip . for example my home twon is in india , one time i went to agra to see the tajmahal . that is really a beautiful place i do n't know anybody in that place at that time i paid to a person who is guided me . and that person is very nice he showed me all the place around the tajmahal and he is also stated telling story about the tajmahal and i like that information he gaved me . that is also a nice thing about a guide . that time i did not realize that i came alone . either of the way we go with friend or we go alone what is most important is we really enjoyed or not .
