the word community includes every single creature in a particular area . this categorzation of community is based on some of the following like caste , religion , workplace , age etc. , the example are like brahmin community in inida , hindu community , infosys development community and senior citizens community respectively . i agree with the statement that young people these day are not spending enough time in helping their community . firstly , young people particularly of teenaged are busy in their studying activites a they feel it is most important to get higher grade in their is more important to them which would help them in having a good life at a later point of time . for example younger one who are studying in the semi-residential school are forced to spend most of their time in school or college which would make him difficult to attend the helping work because of the fullday busy schedule . secondly , with the advance of technology in various field ha reduced the need for younger one to help others in their community particularly the elder among them . for example in older day where if a elderly person in a community desire to write a letter , he would take help a younger one for writing . but , with the advent of phone the necessity of a younger to help the aged-citizen is avoided . thirdly and importantly the selfishness feeling among the younger one ha changed their mind to deny help to any one in the community . although mutual co-ordination is important in a communtiy for good relation among the people in it , it is given least importance than it should be given only because of the feeling of selfishness . for example , a younger would like to lend his belonging if and only if the person he is lending is offering something in return to what he ha given . lastly self-enjoyment is considered important these day which is preventing a younger to help his community in some way or the other . for example one would prefer to enjoy in an event organised by someone else rathre than to organise the event for others . finally , with all the above mentioned reason the younger one are not able to spend enough in helping the community in which they live around .
