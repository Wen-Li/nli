much of the traveling that take part in the world is in new site for the one that undergone the trip . although direction of the travleing could beneffit from some expert , with some tour guide , i defenitly preffer not to travel with one . my main reason , is that i like traveling to the unknown . with this in mind , the use of a tour guide will ruin this fasination . two year ago , my girldfriend and i went to europe and in the airplane met other couple that were traveling to the same destination . even , we stay in the same hotel . they decided to walk freely on the street , enter the place they wanted , go to event that the very same day were anounced or hear about , among other action . all this decitions alowed them to presence very exciting thing that happened in the city , and that make news all over the world . in contrast , we keep secure , completely safty , nothing exciting schedule of going to the museams and castle . second , is that i like flexibility in my vacation . it is enough the time constrait in my job , the unflexible schedule , to bring it with me to my hollydays , the time of the year i travel . for example , in the second year of collage me and my friend went to chiapas , mexico , to visit the mayan piramids . at that trip we were lead with a tour guide with a very unflexible schedule . this make u impossible to enjoy the trip because of the timing and the place we already want it to spend the most . after this experience , i decided never traveling with a tour guide again . that is way i enjoy traveling without a tour guide .
