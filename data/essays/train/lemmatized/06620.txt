it wil be better of knowing broad knowledgeof many academic subject rather than to specialize in one subject . education is the manifestation of perfection alredy in man. the knowledge which we get from dufferent subject are un comparable with the horizon of the sky , the patience of the earth , the flow of water , the greenary of nature . if we go through the academic way there will definitly increase inthe burden in the subject in this manner we can improve our skill to solve a problem , if we are concentrate only one subject it will be good only to that subject where we can score good mark only in that subject , here the main disadvantage is that we can not solve different kind of problem , he may be profeessional in that subject than also he can not use the other tactic which are known in other subjests . consider a student who interested in the subject physic and he concentrat only on this subject , and he also had a mathematics subject where he concentating le on it , it really creates a problem in future because physic deal with some part of math and the student must known the minimum knowledge about math so that he can solve a problem , so it is must that concentrating on different academic lead a perfect life to the student . here iam talking about the acdemic subject , these are always related to the previous subject so it will be easy to understand the concept easily once we followed and these concept can be applied to solve a problem easily and accurately . if here student are confused with the different subject then atleast they should concentrate on there core subject which always relate to their previous semisters and this will definitly help in the techniqal field where he should know the basic of the subject . here student ha make shoure that they are concentrating on there related subject rather than unussual thing like student in math field should not concentrate much on the medicine field because they are not going to deal medicine in future , similar way medicine student must not concentrate much on math field . here conclusion to this is it will be advantage to the student who had much knowledge on different subject rather than student who concentarte only one subject .
