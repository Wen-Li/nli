i belive that there will be more car in twenty year . what form my oppinion are different point . the first is caused by the individal need for transportation . this meas that every one of u want to reach a destination at every time in the shortest possible way . this mean , probably the car will not be like the car we have today , but there will always be automobile for an individual journey form one place to another . a transportation in a train or bus can never replace this , just because a train or a bus need to be profitable , so it need to transport a many people at once and this lead u to a scedule for a department . this mean it is no more a leaving a place at one time i wish and it will not bring me exactly to the place i wish . our need for a resting time more and more need that we work in a place far away from the place we work . i can say this of my own , that i prefer to live in an little town away from the city where i work . it mean that when i come home to my little town the world is not a busy and stressful . this daily journey lead me to a drive of some kilometer i am doing every day by car . my wife doe the same just in the other direction . so this lead u to have two car and when i compare this to my parent they just only had one car , what wa enough for them . for u , compared to my parent is ha become normal to work and live in different city . this automatically lead to more car in a family . of course we could use a train or a bus , but in my case it would be cheaper just about a fifth of the cost i pay for going by car and the other aspect , the far more important , is , that it would take me about half an hour more every day , what mean that this is an hour i can spend le with my family . so all in all i belive that it will be normal in twenty year that every adult person will own a car just for the daily movement . it will be le and le that you work and live in the same city . i hope i am wrong because my wife allways tell me how long or short the oil recources will be availablz
