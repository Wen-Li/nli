i do not agree with the statement that young people do not spend time to helping their community at this time . this is not true at all because you can see a lot of young people share their free time in project to help other people a volunteer of red cross for example or collect money or food to send to non development country . people nowadays have more information than before about what go on around them , on the world . these information are seeing in the television , reading on the newspaper or by internet , talking with his friend or collegues . another thing is the new thecnologies made possible comunicate with more person and share information faster than you could imagine before about what 's happen in a place and the possiblity to going those place are more easily . all these thing made young people to be in contact with the reality and they aware up about problem in their community and in the rest of the world and try to help in the way they can . i am really surprise when i saw young people share their time going to home of lonely old people one or two time a week , or when they help in his community to collect food , clothes or money to send non-development country or when some tragedy occurs . i really proud these young people because they are the future of next generation and they made a better world f
