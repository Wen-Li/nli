i agree with the statement of successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in this society , i think that if you do not try news thing , you would be just a worker but not the bos , because the bos need to have the ambition , confidence , and interest to be success . first , ambition is the main point to let the people try new thing . if you have n't the ambition , you would not try with new thing and just only doing what you already know how to do well , because you have no ambition to accept the fault that you make or you have no ambition to accept you are not success . ambition is a thought in your mind that give conmfident to you and do the thing . if you always escape to face to try new thing , you would not get sucess any more . second , confidence also really important to let the people try new thing . confidence and ambition are very similar , but ambition is internal , and confidence is external . for example , you need to attend in a competition of basketball , and you never play basketball before , you have the amnbition to try to play the basketball , but you do not have the confidence to attend in the competition because you have no confidence to win this competiton . confidence not only create by yourself , also you have confidence or not is because of your close friend or family , if they are support you , you would have confidence to try the new thing . third , your interest of what you want to know also really important . for example , i need to apply in an university , and i need to choose the subject , and i am good in art , i want to be a art designer , which mean drawing is my interest , if i get in the university , i need to learn the new thing and skilld oif art , but this is my interest , although it is diffcult to learn , but i still would face it . at last , have ambition , confidenceand interest are helping me to be the successful people try new thing and take riskd rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . if i am a person that dont try any new thing and just odo somethings that i am always doing good , i would think the thing bored and no success feeling on the thing .
