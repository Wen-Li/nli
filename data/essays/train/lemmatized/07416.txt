i would agree with the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialise in one specific subject '' i think it is wise to be a ` jack of all trade but may be master of none ' . if one know sufficient about many subject but not everything about a particaular subject then he might not be able to top any subject but atleast he would not fail any of the subject and if he performs reasonably ok in most then his overall performance would certainly be enhanced . also it is always helpful in daily life aswell a in term of future prospect if one ha a broad academic knowledge . this would open him to far more career opportunity than if he limit his knowledge to only certain subject . say for example , in high school , some one who ha scored grade ` a ' in physic or mathematics while grade ` c ' in all other subject , although may be able to get into a top class engineering university but would not have much other choice left incase he decides not to go for engineerin . on the other hand , if one score a ` b ' in most of his subject he may not be able to get into the top class college but would certainly manage in a fairly good college and at the same time enjoy the liberty of having many career option to choose . this also come into play when one is applyinfg for job in future a the person having knowledge in various academic field would find himself in a situation where he could apply in various institution . also in place of his work , he might someday make use of his knowledge in other academic field than what he is currently practicing , helping him handle a critical situation better and attain more success at work and a thus a brighter future ahead . to summerise , knowledge never go waste . so it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . although exception might be there , a they always are , but in the long run it help to have a broader spectrum of knowledge .
