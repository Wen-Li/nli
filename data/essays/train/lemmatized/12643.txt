to answer this question , i will organize in two part . the first part will explain who i think young people enjoy life more than older people , and ( even if i 'm not so old ) the second part will explain how i think older people can appreciate life more than youngers . we all remember the first time , the first time we made love , the first time we went to highschool , the first time we smoked a cigarette . i think this is one of the reason we might say younger can appreciate life in a more intensive way than the olders , just because everything they do is knew . teenage is the period where you hqve lot of experience , it 's an adventure , you discover all the time . i remember my teenage . it wa kind of amazing and i think i would never be able to experience the same feeling i 've experienced during this period . i wa always going to party , when i wa 15 me and my freind would go to night club and everything ha a important impact on me because it wa knew . an other argument is that young people have no reponsability : they do n't have money problem , or job problem or even child problem , there parent take care of everything so they do n't have to worry about all those thing that make life difficult . but in contradiction with all that i said before , i would point that maybe older people are able to enjoy life in a better way . adult have a larger experience witch give them a knoweledge young people do n't have . having this experience they can appreciate thing young people woud n't even care about . it 's hard for me to give exemples because i do n't consider myself a an complete adult . but maybe adult can enjoy very infime thing like a good glass of an old wiskey for exemple . one day a professor told me : the more you know , the more you like . i think old people , a they know more about life , can enjoy it even more . on more point is that young people do n't have the time to establish important project . what is life about after all ? i think life is about being happy and making such a wonderfull thing a child . adults have the oppurunity to live this kind of wonderfull project . they have the opportunity to make plan . the plan of creating a society , the plan of creating a family .
