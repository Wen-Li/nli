i disagree that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today by the following reason . first , many people who live in local place will be not able to use the official translation system , train and bus . in the near future , many railway company and bus company will cut thier local line in order to cut the cost to move train and bus . to get profit from the local line , they need many passenger . but now the number of passenger are very few . so they can not get profit from the local line and they have to cut the line . if they wo n't cut the local line , they need to increase their fee . thus , the people who live in local place want to and have to use their own car . when i wa elementary school student , i lived in hokkaido in japan . at that time , the service of many line of japan national railway in hokkaido wa stopped . thus , my father had to buy a car . second , the new technology of car 's engine will invent for saving gasoline . many people think that the cost of gasoline will increase and they will be not able to use gasoline to ride a car in the near future . but nowadays , some car dealer sell new car which have a hybrid system ( gasoline and electricity ) , for example , toyota purius , honda insight and toyota estima . in europe , many car manifactures is trying to use diesel engine instead of gasoline engine . at last month , ceo of volkswagen came to japan and announce that they will sell many diesel car in japan in the near future . thus , i think that fuel will remain in twenty year as above the reason i showed , i can not agree the number of car will decrease in twenty year .
