i agree that product seem much better than they really are in most of advertisement . the purpose of advertisement is to make people buy thing or service from the supplier 's point of view . therefore company are trying hard to make thier product look better . in addition , a lot of technology are available to do so . finally the government is not playing a role to restrict the way of advertisement effectively . companies have to make a profit by selling their product or service to the people a much a possible . they most of the time conduct some study to graps the public favarite in order for reflect the result to the advertisement . recently , the development of the technology ha made it possible for the company to thier thing look more attractive in the advertisement . one example is most of they use some kind of effecting function when they take the photo or the film of thier product for the advertisement in order to appeal the people efficiently and effectively . in some extreme case , completely created computer graphic image are used a a photo of the product . sometimes the company do too much to make their product look better , and people would doubt about the product in thier hand is really the same thing they saw in the advertisement . in this kind of case , the consumer is sort of decieved by the coompany . that is why government ha to take some action to prevent the company from advertising with exagaration . however , in the matter of fact , government see the company than the consumer because the company pay a lot more tax if they make larger profit . even though there are some good point in advertisement , such a helping people to choose which product to buy , or providing new information about the product , i personally think that the strikter rule should be established to restrict the exagration of the product , and company must have to try to be honest , trusting the quality of thier product .
