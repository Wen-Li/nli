i disagree with the following statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today a following reason . first , instead of car , nothing will be improved and developed in twenty year . i can not find any special reason which there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in addition to car , we use train , plane and ship everywhere , however , car are the most useful and convenient for people . for example , it is very easy to go from the house to the destinaion for child and disabled people especially . they do not need to walk to the station and airport . second , there will be fewer population in twenty year . people have their own car . if the population decrease drastically , the amount of the car will decrease . however , it is said that chinese and indian population will increase drastically . it mean they will have the chance to get their own car in twenty year . for example , in japan it will have the chance to increase many car due to traffic circumstance . it is said that there will be 25 % of old people living . i think they can not continue to use japanese railway and subway . there are a lot of problem for them . first , there are not eleveters at the station . it is impossilbe to use the station forever even if they are healthy . second , there is a ruch hour , commuting time every day . it start at 9 o'clock and finish at 5 o'clock at japanese company . even if you are young student and office worker , it is difficult to adjust to the curcumstances . in conclusion , i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
