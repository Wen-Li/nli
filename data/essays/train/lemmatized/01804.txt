i agree with the statement , that young people do not give enough time helping their community . an article in a german magazine said , that today we live in a world of interships . whenever you have free time , you have to spend it sensible , which mean by spending it in a way , that it look good on your curriculum vitae . working in your community , helping old people for example , might look good on your cv because by that you can show your social skill . but if that community work is senseless for your further professional life , you will not do it bacause there is no use for you . that is how it work today . everything you do ha to have a sense for your own future . so if you want to proof your social skill , you would probably prefer picking out an internship or any other service , that is more linked with your future working goal . one reason for this way of deciding , what to do , is competition . in my opinion we live in a world of competition . not only in school or university , everyone is competing , whether it concern your schoolmarks or your ability to make new friend . everything is a question of competition . if you plan to work in your community in the future , helping your community is a possibility of raising your chance of getting a job later . but because of competing against everybody around you , it is kind of out of fashion just to help somewhere out without getting a piece of paper , that say what you have done . maybe there are some people , who help their community without expecting to get a document afterwards but i think , this might only be few . further there might be person who would like to hepl , but do not have the time to do so because of their professional life for example . helping in fact mean , doing something without a reward . nobody i know ha the time left to do something without getting a reward . so i guess there are quite a lot of different reason , wheather it is their profession , their goal or their opinion by not wanting to help their community because people think , nobody would help them , there are not many people left who actually help their community . and i do not believe , that the number of people , who are willing to help will increase in the future .
