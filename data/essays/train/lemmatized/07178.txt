i agree to have a speicalized knowledge on a specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subject . according to me , when a child is brought in a school and later to higher secondary school , he is taught all academic subject which will lead him to a better understanding of this world . after attending the school , a student ha a broad perspect of different subject knowledge with him . now a student is capable of using his knowledge which lead to exploration of new idea in his mind and setting a specific goal of his life . the student think of a particular subject a his interest . he develops a penchant for a particular subject . it is in the interest of a student that he work for a specific subject because he will be a adroit and astute student of that subject . a student therefore plan for his masters in that subject . he turn out to be a appropriate person for that specialized subject . he later on join research on that subject and he achieve his goal . according to me , nobody in this world ha capability to master every subject in this world . even scientist like galileo , einstein , newton , etc. had their own interest and specialization which led to different discovery in this world . it implies that if everybody in this world have a broad knowledge of many academic subject then world would be a boring place to stay . there would be no innovation around and it would be tasteless . the versatility of this world would end at it very early age . there a so many living example who ha supported the idea of having a specialized knowledge on a specific subject . from sports to politics , businessman to adventurers , there so many people who life their life for their dream and their goal . one of the best living example of my time is mr. amitabh bachchan . amitabh bachchan is an actor of bollywood industry . he ha did his bachelor in arts and joined bollywood industry . recently , he ha been awarded with the bachelors of performing arts . the ectasy which amitabh bachchan would be having after achieving this degree would be immeasurable . i support specialization on specific subject because it brings you immense happiness when you fulfill your goal of that subject . considering sport on the other hand , football legend like ronaldo , pele , ronaldinho have specialised in their skill and therefore they are at the peak of their career . i would conclude by writing that specialization on a specific subject need high interest in it and hard work to achieve the goal . a person would achieve more fruitful if he is specialized in a specific subject than a person have a mere broad knowledge of many academic subject .
