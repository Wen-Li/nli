the statement is in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . one group of people agree with this statement and one group of people donot agree with the statement . i find many reason for not agreeing with the statement . i personally donot agree with the statement . yes , technology is developing day by day but this doe not necessarily mean that there will be no car in twenty year . this is unpredictable . now a day people are working hard and are making their life comfortable that is they are acquiring everything they need . what make life more comfortable ? the answer is having more luxury and having more comfort . people are more concentrating on luxury which includes mobile for communication , vehicle that is car , bike for transport , own house for living and so on . so people buy vehicle bike , scooter , car etc . most luxurious of all is car . not only luxurious , it is safer than many other vehicle . so buying car will definitely increase that is there will be many car in use in twenty year . these reason donot support with the statement . secondly , people are trying to reach the goal above their standard . for example a person using a two wheeler vehicle , even though it is hard for him to buy a car , keep his goal of buying a car due to various reason . some of them are for avoiding pollution and accident . they feel having a car is far better than having other vehicle . the main reason is car is affordable . and moreover now a day car with electric facility ar available that is having gas engine . this is safer because it doesnot lead to pollution . therefore , using car is day by day increasing . for all these reason which are discussed above , i donot agree with the statement that fewer car will be in use than there are today . i strongly believe that there will be no attrition in the use of car in twenty year and there will be more number of car in use than there are today in twenty year .
