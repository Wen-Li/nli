i disagree with the statement that there will be fewer car in twenty year than there are now . first of all there wa no considerable change in the last twenty year and i think there will not be one in the next twenty . although there have been going on some development that speak for the use of public transport , such a the increasing oil price or the ongoing improvments in public transport , the reason why people use car or refuse to take public vehicle will stay the same over the next twenty year . i think the first and most important reason why a lot of people will not give up their car is the flexibility it brings . you do not have to care about bus schedule . if you want to go somewhere you simply enter your car and immediately you are on your way . a further , also very important reason is the independency a car brings . you do not have to worry about how to come to the next train station or what to do if you need to go somewhere in the middle of the night when no public transport is active . neither you have to care about being late for work a the train is late . you only depent on yourself . another fact that support my theory is that the price for public transport are still quite expensive . considering that they have not change considerably in the last twenty year i do not expect them to get much cheaper in the next twenty year . furthermore car and their efficency are improved continuously , which make them more and more independent from the oil price . i think that all the mentioned reason contribute their part to the theory that in twenty year there will be a many car in use a there are today .
