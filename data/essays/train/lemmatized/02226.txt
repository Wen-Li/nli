for my living country , i agree in twenty year there will bd fewer car in use than there are today . i have two point support that , the more convenient public transportation and the oil more expensive . firstly , in my living country , taiwan , there is a smaller place than most of county . it spends 5 or 6 hour from north to sounth . if you want to around the iland , it just take 2 or 3 day . because of that , taiwan have good public transport system . if you want to go this place to another place far away downtown , you just have to check which bus you can take you to the place you want , enev you have not one chooses . you can choose the way you want , like taking bus or by train . if you want to go to this place to another place in downtown , you still not need to walk , you can take mrt . it can take you to everywhere you want . for example , i live in hsingshin . i must go to taipen for toefl test . all i need to do is taking train and mrt , i can arrive the place . secondly , the oil is more and more expensive . if we have car , we must pay mush money for using oil . the priece of oil will become more expensive in the furture . it will cost lot of money for oil . if we do not have car , we do not worry about those kind of problem . that will help u save much money . for example , many people want to buy the car which can use oil effectivily . if we take public transport system , we can share the rise up priece of oil . that may not cost a lot . by those two reansons , i agree in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
