were there be more car in the future comparing to the number of car used today ? in today 's world , car were used everywhere for the efficiency of transportation for people . they were the necessity of people in this century , and they served a an important tool used today . in my opinion , i disagreed that number of car would decrease in twenty year . in contrast , i believe that the number of car would increase in the near future . first , a what i 've mentioned previously , car were an important usage for the people today . they made people easier to travel around their country , and they encouraged vacation outside their city . as people noticed the importance of car everyday , they would a well encouraged them to buy a car for the sake of their own . as population increased , more teenager would dream of having a car . as more and more people joined this world , more car would be bought by consumer . with the growth of technology , consumer would have to buy more car in order to maintain themselves in the world of modern technology . second , a more and more people in this world earned more money , they would have the desire to buy more car rather than one . cars were made very attractive these year , and more people were attracted to the beauty and the eloquence of the newly designed car . with the amount of fortune they have , they would be easily convinced to buy another car to fulfill their desire . owning two or three car in the garage , people would be able to raise their social standard , and cope with the advancement of modern technology . last but not least , family that consisted of more than six member would have the intention of buying more car . one car in this kind of family wa definitely not enough . as the family grew , they would want to change their car into bigger one that could fit the entire family . furthermore , the family would have to buy extra car to meet different reason . for example , one car could be used to drive child to school , while the other bigger car for family vacation . moreover , car were the only way that family could travel together at a lower price . driving a car would only cost you fuel price , but other transportation such a long distance bus and airplane would cause you more . although many people would forfeit old car and buy new one to balance the number , the number of car would simply increase a more family came to existence in this world . cars would grew their importance in this society , and people would begin to recognize their value . with the help of these car , people could enjoy themselves more in an advanced society , and more time would be saved .
