the statement in the title point out an important issue in education : is it more urgent to memorize information or to develop transversal capability ? of course student need to learn fact . how could i understand the history of my country without knowing what ha happened in the last century ? further , if we did n't study the biographic fact of an author , then we would lose important information that might have been useful in order to get the meaning of his poetry . in my experience , it is useful to know and display some knowledge also when i have to support an opinion , since my idea become more concrete and persuasive . considering these advantage , traditional school used to stress the mnemonic side of learning , creating well prepared student . on the other hand , these student could be a bit rigid . for instance , my italian teacher at highschool did n't accept any alternative way of presenting the content and she expected u to memorize page and page , without asking for any critical development . the result is that i forgot the most part of the literature i studied in those year , which is a real shame ! while traditional school used to put too much emphasis on learning fact , modern teacher , on the contrary , try to focus on concept rather than on mere fact . a deep understanding of the key idea of an author , for instance , implies a double advantage . on one hand it is easier to remember something that you have thought about : my english teacher , for instance , used to ask for our opinion regarding an author 's idea and she even tried to make sense of phrasal verb , in order to let u memorize them ! on the other hand , when you become familiar with idea and concept , you are likely to improve your capability of thinking with your mind . since in my opinion this is the first aim of school , far beyond a mere transmission of content that could be forgotten very easily , i agree with the statement in the title .
