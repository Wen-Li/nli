i totally agree with the statement about the young people nowadays . the reason why i think so is because i actually see this phenomenom , young people are spending all the time on their own self and seldom care about thier own community . after school , most people would ask to play around out side , seldom of them might think of there own community , like their community have nothing to do with them , it 's only a place where offer your commodation . but i 'm not like them other guy , i think that making our effort to help our community is so important . in my opinion , the atmosphere of the communiy you live will directly affect your mind , mood and behavior . we all know that people could be affected by their surrounding evironments so easily . in one of my class , a teacher told u to concern about our own community , do our best to help our community to go better , and he would constantly asking u if we are doing the right thing ! i feel this is so good for u to establish our conscience in our own place . everyone is responsible for their community , because those are n't your private area , i think everyone should collaborate together to help thier community , in order to make their ownselfs a better living . as the proverb go `` all bird flock together . '' it reveals that if you are making effort tohelp your own community , others will start to contact you and do it with you , this really help a lot . in a nutshell , i think that we should start to educate our own offspring to know how important it is to help our own community , only a little people is not enough , we should promote it a a civic activity , live begin at our own community , with more help , there is a better tomorrow .
