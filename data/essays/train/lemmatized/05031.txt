there are two kind of people of working on the world . one kind of people is trying new thinkgs and the another kind of people is not trying new thing just only doing what they already been doing . most of people want to be successful people . but it is too hard to be that people . if you want to be successful people you 'd better try new thing . there are three thing that are help to understand to my opinion . first . the world is fast changing what we can not see it changing . for example , 20years ago , did we know about computer 's technology such a e-mail , game , and fax . but what about now ? we usually use computer when we are working . if i did n't know computer 's technolohy , we would spend much time than before . as you know , we should learn about how to use computer and try it . second , we know somebody who is already successful and they try new thinkgs . as you know , the presdent of ms ( micro soft ) who is the best bussiness man in the world and best rich . according to some researcher , he always try new thing . if he did n't try think about pc ( persnol coputer ) , we would n't use pc now . another person is bush who is presdent of u.s . he try to make great conutry . he always think that how to be u.s stronger than now . most of american think he is a great presdent . third , somebody who is not trying new thing can not improve anymore . of course , they are professional in their major . however . can they follow the changing of world ? they did n't know about that . they did n't get new idea from experiense of new thing . finally , new thing can show me new idea . sometimes it will be able to give fail to u . but we should keep trying new thing . do you want to be successful ? try it and get great idea .
