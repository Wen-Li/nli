even bad marketing is marketing . in my opinion a successful person is someone who take risk and try new think . i am the best exmple for this statement : two week ago , i had an interview at the walt disney company for an internship . of course i could have come to this interview a every one else : nicely dressed , conservative and serious . i would show him my image of a good teammember and some other strength . so i would have had a nice interview and maybe a chance to get the job . but i wanted to get a better chance on the job : so i came a the comic figure daisy . i wore a white blouse with a daisy pin and a nice skirt , combined with a pink bow in my hair . i knew that my behaviour wa not usual and i wa aware of the risk i wa taking with this strategy . first of all , everybody looked at me when i came in , so i got the full concentration on my person . it wa a little bit risky , because this attention can be positive or negative , but for sure they will remember me . furthermore , my interviewer could see that i am an outspoken person with motivation to get the job . of course , the image of daisy matched with the job offer i wa applying for . i had to fight for the very first minute of the interview to give the interviewer the impression that i am still a serious , conservative and trustful worker but it wa worth it . the interviewer gave me the job right away and when i asked why he decided so quick he said : you applied for the job in an unusual way and showed me that you are able to think out of the box . actually , we were looking for someone who take risk to achieve his goal and you are this person .
