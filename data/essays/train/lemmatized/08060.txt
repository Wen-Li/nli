on an economy that is based on the selling of product , going from restaurant , to technology product , to simply grocery or even real state . to try your best to sell a product is understandable . and nowing that traditionaly on many part of the world , people will buy product not by the way they taste , of they work , but by the way they look or simply because that is the `` thing '' to buy . myself being on the restaurant bussines , i ca n't say that i agree or disagree on advertisement making product seem better than what they are . reason being that i find myself on both side of the statement . i definitly agree that you have to sell a product for what it is , and do n't hide anything , or lie to your customer . but how do you do , when you are trying to sell the best product on the world , but it just doe not look good enough for people to buy . i identify myself with both side of the card , on one side , i am the costumer , and i want to buy a product , that do exactly what they do when they shoe it on the adverstisements , i want to go a 5 star restaurant and get a 5 star treatment , and a 5 star food . on the other side of the card , i understand , that if you need to sell a product , you have to find the way to make your costumer buy your product . there is nothing wrong to try to to be succesful , a long a your advertisement stay a close a possible to the real thing . and there is nothing wrong either to ask for what you paid for . as long a the costumer understands that sometimes adverstisements are going to picture thing a they are not , people are going to try to push thing a they are not .
