some people believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept , while others believe that it is more important for student to learn fact . i maintain the opinion that both the ability to understand idea and concept and the ability to learn fact are equally important in the study of a student . the ability to understand idea and concept and the ability to learn fact are mutually benificial . on the one hand , understanding idea and concept will help student to learn fact faster and better . for example , if a student of psychology understands the concept of behavior modification , he/she will be able to learn the fact that associate with how a elimentary school child behaves in class and how this child change his/her behavior better and faster . also , it is unlikely that this psychology student will forget these fact once he/she understands this concept . on the other hand , learning fact will provide student with evidence that support their understanding of idea and concept . in other word , idea and concept will be supported by the fact that student learn . for instance , a student of history will be more likely to understand the concept of westward movement when he/she remembers that conflict between the white settler and indians , the spread of america 's land , and the social , political , and economic change during that particular time period of history . the ability to understand idea and concept and the ability to learn fact are mutually dependent . a good student need to both understand idea and concept and learn fact . a student who can only understand idea and concept without learning the fact will find the idea and concept dry and boring without being able to explain event in the real world . the process of learning will thus become mechanical recitation of theory without knowing how they work in practical application . a student who can only learn fact will find himself/herself lost in the plethora of fact without being able to make sense of the apparently unrelated fact . the process of learning will in turn become isolated part that do not form a illstrative whole . thus , any student who can only master one ability among the two will find himself/herself crippled in his/her study , and it is unlikely that he/she will do well in hes/her study in the academic area . in history , any great scientific and academic advancement is built upon the premise of both theoretical idea and concept and fact based on practical application of theory , and the successful combination of both result in so many instance of intellectual progress in history . without either one of these two ability , the world we live in and our perception of the world will be very limited . to sum up , it is equally important for student to understand idea and concept and to learn fact . a mastery of both ability will enable student to witness greater achievement in their study .
