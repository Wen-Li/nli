`` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' while reading the statement saying `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' , each person can have their own opinion . personally i disagree with that statement . i will show my point of view in his essay . after witnessing the huge evolution of transportation and communication , we are nowadays very much concerned about the environemental problem that are caused by this evolution . however , people ca n't stop using transportation method though it destroys the environement . for the past twenty year , we have seen that the number of car in use is increasing . in fact nowadays it ha become an essential part of our life . twenty year ago , each family had a car , whereas nowadays each member of the family ha his own car , which did n't only increse the environemantal probems but we are also facing a huge number of car accident which , most of the time can lead to death . on another hand , car are being used nowadays to travel . many people think that car are saffer than airplane . and sometimes car could be used to take big or heavy thing when airplane ca n't handle the weight . people today are very attached to their car . in fact , people can personalise their car , by the color , the car model , the seat . .. it became part of our identity . people are more and more attached to their car , and that 's why i do n't see how in twenty year there could be fewer car in use than there are today . i personally disagree with this statement because i think that car became part of our life . if we come to think about it , we all use the car on a daily basis , at least once a day . . the only way to have fewer car in use in the next twent year is having an evention that would replace the car , which ca n't really be made in a short period of twenty year .
