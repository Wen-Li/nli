some person think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i think that it is not true . first , older people may feel not having taken enough pleasure in their previous life , so during their last year they want to do thing for which they had not enough time before . thus , they enjoy more each moment and take advantage of the present instant because they know it is their last chance . on the contrary , young people are always in a hurry , they want to do a lot of thing , manage to do few of them and they do n't enjoy what they experiment because they are not thinking to one thing at the time . on the other hand , there is a more material reason for which older people enjoy life more than young people : older people are often retired and they are a part of the society with a higher consumption power . it is easier for them to enjoy what the life can offer . for example , they can do some trip that they could n't afford before because they had their child at home and because it wa necessary to pay for their study . however they did n't have time for that because they were working . finally , older people have gain more maturity and they are aware of the value of thing . so they can better enjoy what is available to them . the more something is difficult to reach and the more we wait for getting it , the more it will be valuable . the more something is rare , the more it is enjoyable . nowadays , a lot of young people believe that everything is due to them and they do n't measure the value of what they get . when we are older , we are able to meausre the chance we had and that we did n't measure in the past . that is why i think that we must wait to be older to really enjoy the life , because being older give more chance to be able to do what we really wanted .
