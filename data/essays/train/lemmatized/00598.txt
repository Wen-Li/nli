iam of the opinion that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i would like to cite my response on the student who have to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn . i would like to explain several example and reason to the issue . the student must understand the concept and idea . for example , if we have a mathematical subject in our graduation course , it is very difficult to solve the problem if we are unable to understand the idea and concept . so we would like to work hard on understanding the idea and concept even though we are unable to understand . for better reason we can consider the more example in accordance with the issue . in our daily life the idea and concept are more preferable when compared to learn fact . the more reason in support to the issue are , we will digest the concept which are happening in our regular life once we ca n't digest those concept we have to face more difficulty . if we are doing a business then first of all we will learn the idea and also how to form idea in development of that business . these concept and idea will take a major role in several application . if we learned the concept more effectively , we would done a great job in our application such a in study , business and in our department . in some case the learning of fact would be a achievable thing in our goal . here some example which support the learning fact , if we are able to learn the fact effectively then we can achieve some better result in the life .
