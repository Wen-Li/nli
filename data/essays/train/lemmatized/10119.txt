old temple , beautiful japanese tree , and traditional japanese snack and food . kyoto is one of my favorite place to travel . on the contrary , tokyo is where modern life of japanese people can be observed . high building , crowded street , and fetid smell of smog . but what if you do not know anything about japan and would like to travel ? would you rather buy a tour package led by a tour guide ? the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide because of lack of personal preparetion , flexibility , and personal experience . the first reason that a tour guided by a guide is not recommended is that people tend not to prepare by themselves . it is true that a guide know the place the tourist will go and prepare plan for them . however , it is very uninteresting for tourist to go place without personal preparation . for example , if you are interested in japanese history and go to kyoto , it will be a great pleasure . rather than the guide telling you what happened in horyu-temple and why kinkaku-temple wa constructed , if you learned by yourself and are interested in , it will be more great excitement to go there . in addition , lot of information are easily available online or in book , you do not have to get a tour guide to travel around . thus , you can prepare by yourselves to fit to your own interest and excitement . the second drawback of a tour guided by a guide is lack of flexibility . the plan is so rigid that you do not have freedom to spend your time a much a you wish . the guide shout , `` get off the bus at 2:15 pm , and come back at 3:15 pm . be sharp ; otherwise , other people will be annoyed . '' how doe it sound ? on the other hand , if you find a place is so boring and have to stay for three hour because of the schedule of the tour , how do you feel ? in addition , the plan of the tour doe n't necessarily reflect your interest . mostly , the plan by a guide is so generalized that the place you will go are more likely famous place . for example , i went to france primarily to see the iron chuck which is the standard of measurement because i am interested . is there any tour like that ? lastly , the first and second disadvantage of a tour led by a guide strongly relate to lack of personal experience . if you prepare by yourself and go to the place to learn something more , the journey will be very brilliant . if you have a travel desined by your own taste and favorite , the journey might be difficult but be unique . if you find the place uninteresting and dull , you can change your plan . if you find a better restauraunt to eat , you can just hop into the restaurant . all these experience will be so precious , personal , and luminious . in conclusion , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide due to lack of personal preparation , flexibility , and personal experience . yes , travel with a guide might be safer and knowledgble , but getting personalized and unique experience in travelling is the most important .
