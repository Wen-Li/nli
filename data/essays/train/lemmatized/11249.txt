the most important thing to remeber is the meaning of the word advertising . advertising mean to communicate to a specific target the best carachteristics of the product or of the service for that focus target . the advertisement have to follow a basic rule : sell out a much a possible . if a man asks to a nice woman go out for dinner , what do you think he will show of himself to her ? it 's a very easy question , everybody know . he will be elegant , nice and kind . he will pay the dinner also for the girl and he will drop up her to her house . what about if we go to an interview for a very important job ? we will show our best . the bos will know that nobody can be perfect but if we will not show our best in such a important interview we are not so clever . it 's up to u : we have to sell yourself ! i think is the same think with the advertisement . they show u the best but we know that something ca n't be a good a showing there . the big company spend a huge quantity of money to do advertising and they must have a feedback after . ovviously they try to show you the best thing in their product or in their service because they want that the custumer buy them . but we also must remember that now the law is very strickt about the false advertisement . the company have to follow the rule and ca n't tell to the target something untrue . in every situation we try to show our best and they try to do the same with the product or the service . it 's their job . it 's important to not be superficial in every aspect in our life : from the advertisement to the people we could meet . remember to be focus in what we really need . there is a child story with a little girl with a red dress . everyone know this story and every story ha a moral : they want to teach u to do n't believe in everything . so let 's try to remeber the little girl and her adventure !
