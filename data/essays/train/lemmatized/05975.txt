i agree and disagree with the following statement '' young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . nowadays , everything is different . if we compare today to two hundred year ago , we will see a lot of difference such a different culture , people and place . however , child never change . they always have the feeling that they should never work and always play . according to my experience , i agree more with the following statement than i disagree . young people ( teenager or child ) do not have the spirit for working or helping on anything . they are mostly attracted to the computer game , movie , soccer , basketball and other thing . therefore , it is not their fault that they do not do some thing . however , it is their responsiblity to do at least some of the thing they have to do . there are also other teenager or child who are by far different from the people who always play computer game or watch tv programmes . these kind of people ( teenager or child ) might be a young a other child but might be much more mature than the other . these kind of young people usually give enough time to helping their community . however , young people not giving enough time to helping their community might result from the parent . the parent have a big role and effect on the life of the child . if the parent always do what the child want , then you would not expect that child to give enough time to helping his/her community . if you get the child whatever he/she want , then he/she will want more and more and you will buy more which will be a very bad influence on the child . for example , i have few extremely rich friend . these people always get what they want . however , they are the one who usually fail during school . so i think the parent might also effect the child .
