i disagree to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . i have two reason to support my opinion . first of all , i think there is a limit that people can learn . if they want to study many academic subject , the knowledge of them become usefulless . i think people can not concentrate them with such a lot of subject at once ! it ha no meaning that people have usefulless knowledge . secondly , all of the people must have the subject they are good at and not so . for example , i belong to the fuculty of arts and letters . i think i am good at english and japanese but not good at math and science . my friend in this faculty also say that . on the other hand , my friend who are in the faculties of science , engeneering , agriculture say that they are good at math and science but not good at japanese . it is obviously on hand ! studying the subject that people are not good at is not effective . they feel more boring when they study such subject than when they study one they like . these are the reason why i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject . to concentrate with one subject in particular you are interested in , it is done a lot of great study each section .
