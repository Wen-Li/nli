i agree with the statement argues that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are , according to the general concept of advertisement and my own personal experience . first of all , the aim of advertisement is to sell those product they want to sell , therefore it should promote consumer 's desire to buy those product . thus advertisment are n't suppose to make any negative impression about product , since their aiming for celling them , not to make people refuse to buy . this is why most advertisement try to make an effort to show product better than the actual product because they want to sell a much a possible . by using better picture , catch copy , extra . for example about an exaggeration that i found in my personal experience , i bought a detergent that had a catch copy of `` never left dirt on your clothes '' in it advetisement . i washed my clothes by using a laundry machine with that detergent although i later found out some dirty spot on my shirt . it had n't got cleaned off at all . i got so disappointed since i believed in that advetisement , although i can not accuse it . advertisments should n't be totally false but still consuremers should be aware that mainly they contain somewhat exaggeration , to show product better and make people buy . in addition advertisement is not a declaration towards the consumer , because we consumer have to judge whether we believe that advertisement or not . as i discussed , many advertisement include exaggeration about it product , therefoe i believe that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . in fact i wo n't accuse most advertisement even if they contain some exaggeration , because we know each company ' desire to make product popular . thus each consumer should have an good eye able to judge whether those product can satisfy their expectatations .
