people have different opinion on whether in twenty year there will be fewer car in use that there are today . people who oppose this statement argue that in the future we will also have so many car due to our convenience . they think that using car are the most convenient way to go another place . however , i disagree with this statement for two reason . first of all , in the future , we will have other method to go another place . another reason is that in twenty year , we will go abroad more often . let me explain the reason in detail . to begin with , in twenty year we will have more developed machine instead of car . when my grand-grandfather wa a child , he can not imagine car which is privailing nowadays . he watched car only in movie . this wa because in the past , wagon or horse were the only transportation . however , nowadays we have a lot of transportation such a bus , subway and airplane . it mean that our technology ha rapidly development . therefore , in the future , we will have more technological transportation . next , in the future we can go abroad more frenquently . it mean that we feel no need to use car . we will usually take airplane instead of car . this is because using car can not go foreign country . when i wa young , i just traveled in my country . however , now thing were totally different . recently , many school plan their vacation for student go abroad . in addition , if they travel another country , they have to take airplane , not car . this mean that in the future , we will use airplane for going abroad more often than use car . in conclusion , i support the idea which is that in next generation there will be fewer car in use that there are today for the reason that i mentioned above . first , we are supposed to have other transportation instead of car . second , in the future , we will go abroad more often . therefore we use airplane frenquently . it brings about decreasing of using car .
