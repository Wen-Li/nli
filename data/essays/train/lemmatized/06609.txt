young people might someties be more able to enjoy life than older people because young people have a very important thing in life that unfortunatly elder people do not have ; health . young people are normally more capable of doing activity or thing to enjoy themselves more because they do not have to deal with a many problem a older people have to deal with . the stress that older people have to deal with in their life might lead them not to enjoy life a much they want to . my father once told me something i am never going to forget . he said that when you are young you have the health and the time to enjoy life but you did not have the money to do so . and that one had to work hard to earn money , which might cause u not to enjoy life a much . then when you are older , between forty and fifty , you had normally made more money , you were still healthy but you no longer had time to do anything to enjoy life a we are supposed to . later , when you are old , you had all the money you are going to have and you had all the time in the world , but you no longer had health to enjoy life and have fun . to my opinion , one ha to be able to find the perfect balance between when you are young , older and old . one ha to be able to achieve happiness when you are young by doing thing that do not involve to much money . later , you have to make sure you are leaving enought time for thing such a traveling and family to be able to appreciate life . and when you are finally old and are normally no longer healthy , you have to be able to enjoy life with what you have left , such a family and friend .
