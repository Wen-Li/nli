if always watching the tv , you must see many different kind of advertisement . but most of them are not that true . i have heard someone said most advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are . in my opinion , i totally agree this statement , here is some example for me to support this statement is correct . all producer must want consumer choose their product while consumer are comparing the product towards other substitute . that is the main point why advertisement should make product seem much better than they are . in fact , their aim is to earn money . for example , substitute like fast food shop mcdonald and burger king , papa johns and pizza hut and so on . even film or tv show , they still only promote the best and the most excited part to audience . indeed , that is normal but this is the main point that they did make the product seem much better . i had an experience about a film . watching the advertisement about a horror film through tv , the film wa really exciting and the plot seems really attractive and scary , and so i paid and watched the film in a theatre . however , that is an undoubtedlly bored movie i have seen . the most frightened and excited you could all know from the tv . the advertisement really make the product so nice . another bad experince is i read a advertisement through magazine which is about a hotel . the picture inside were so grand and the food or room are nice . but , when i finally arrived there , i found that the room were dirty and those food are aweful . then i complained to the manager , but his attitute wa bad and arrogant . the result i had received which is far away form that advertisement which shown in magazine . i wa extremely disappointed with that advertisement which make their product seem better . in conclusion , actually the advertisement are not 100 percent true , we should pay attention when we decide to buy it or not , and do not just believe the advisetisment . therefore , a i said i totally agree with that statement which is totally correct .
