i am agree with this statement . young people are becoming more and more selfish everyday . they are beginning to care about themselves only . there are mainly three important reason for not giving enough time for their community ; they have more duty every day , they become to care about themselves only , and degeneration of community . the first reason why the young people doe not help their community is they have more and more duty every day . if we look at the past time , we see that the life is more simple . people are not have to do lot of work at the same time . but life is becoming more and more complicated everyday . for example , a child began to go to school at three year old , and he keep to going school at the age of twenty two . maybe he had to work when he is a student . this give lot of responsibility to the young and so he doe not have time for helping other people . the second reason is that they become more selfish compared to the past . nowadays not only young people but everyone seems to be care only themselves . people are aware of the situtation that everyone life alone and dy alone . but especially youth are more likely to be live alone . this thought cause young people doe not care about community problem . the third and final reason is degeneration of community . nowadays some bad people are using some good people for their need in society . and so good people start to think that why would i help a person without any reason . the main point is people became to not able to see the purpose of helping other people . thus young people do not spend their time helping to other people . to sum up , nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their community because of three main reason . i do not think these are all their fault also the society are responsible of this situtation . yaoung people are immitating the older people . they are just doing what they have seen .
