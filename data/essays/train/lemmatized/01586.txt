i totally disagree with the statement given . rather would like to start the passage with a line rightly said that we have two childhood , one when we are born and the other when we are old . in my opinion childhood is the best time of our life , which again pop up when we are old . this is the association that i would like to make with this statement , a this is the first thing that came to my mind after reading the statement . when a person is young , he is more active , adveturous , enthusiastic about life . probably for the reason that he is physically fit and can take a walk in the nature without thinking twice about it . youngster enjoy the late night party and can manage the cocktail . but what about the stress that they have to undergo , the stress related not only for there position in life but fight that they undergo for their ambition . the fight to rise up . the fight for making correct decision 's in life . it a great responsibility for a young person to live a good and happy life in contrast the old people they are all through with the feeling of anciety or the fight for thir owm right . they again are baby who are looked after for . they have almost done all the thing they wanted in life . they can travel , go to place or even feel free to express themself , and nobody would mind it . though it happens that majority of old people suffer with health problem , but then no one is perfect . both have there bad and good aspect but i would always prefer the one supporting the older generation because i have seen at my home-set - up , the way they have been treated and i kind off like it . so like to conclude by saying that it is a very personal view onlikes and dislike and i woud support the latter , a it is the one which is more mentally stable .
