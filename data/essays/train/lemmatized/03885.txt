most people would tend to consider that youth is the best part of life . unlike them , i think that the older day are often much more enjoyed than the `` golden age '' of youth , which always run to fast . as we become older , we learn to become more aware of our environment and our being so that we can tste bbetter the flavour of life . the main advantage that older people have on younger one is maturity . with a proper education , one learns to see and enjoy thing that young people would no even notice . most child do not understand why the elderly take so many time in their garden takin care of flower which may not be there the following year . when one get mature , he or she also learn a lot about himself or herself , so that they know how to control their feeling and thus , they manage to earn more freedom a they handle their unconscious reaction . the second reason why old people enjoy life more than younger people is that they run out of time . since they have became more mature , they are aware that their life will not last long . not only is each day become more and more special with the passage and time , but they also know they can not do everything they would like to in this limited time , so that older people may try to have a many of their dream a possible come true . as a matter of fact older people have nothing to lose anymore , so that they can do incredible thing . when getting older , people realise the vanity of their childhood 's illusion . they can therefore focus on meaningful matter , compared to which a child 's dream may look a a waste of time . older people enjoy the real life , whereas child often enjoy illusion .
