many people are called specialist because they are specialized in one specific subject . i think specialist are needed in the society to figure out solution for many problem . however , i agree with the statement that it is better to hav broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . only a few initelligent people can be specialist . specializing in one certain subject is very hard and requires much concentration on it and intelligence for it . ordinally people can not compete with such intelligent people who are very into it . also , they must be bored to do one thing continuously and forever . intelligent people can do the specialized work and solving problem for others too . knowing wide range of thing help socialize people . people can not communicate without common topic . broad knowledge give people a lot of idea of topic and enables communicate whoever show up . for example , a couple of people are enjoying talking about english literature . if one know some about them , one can get in the conversation a well . on the other hand , if one ha no idea with them , one can never find a way to communicate with them . knowledge of many academic subject give many choice to people . if a person ha knowledge of math , english , and law , he or she can pick any one of them . if a person specialized in one subject , he or she can not change his or her mind in the middle of the way . it is scary if a person realizes his or her interest is different from what he or she specialized in . that is because she or he ha no knowledge about anything else . he or she need go back to the very first stage of the other choice . overall , people need to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subjecet because intelligents can specialize one subject for other people , broad knowledge help to communicate with other people , and people can get change their mind whenever they want .
