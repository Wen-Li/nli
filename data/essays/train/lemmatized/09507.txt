i am agree with that and i hope is going to be in this way . it depends to u , what we want to do about our future . we are living in this world and we have just this world , but the problem is that we are not living in a sostantable economy , we can not go on in this way and base our society on the oil because the oil will finish . so i think it is time to have a world wide energetic politic that think about the future and not just about today . i know that it is not going to happen soon , because money are more important that the environment , but everybody can see that the clima is changing . for example , anybody know that you use the termomether to misure if you have the flu or not and you can do the same with the world : the result is bad because the temperature is higher than the past , that mean that our world is sick . so , what i hope is that in the next year all the car that use oil will disappeared and instead of this traditional car we can move with hidrogen or electrical car . it will be a world with le car and more train and shared veicholes . it wo n't be an easier or more economic world , but it will be cleaner for sure . it is time to change and everybody care about our future , so for this reason it is time that all the government of the world start to think about that and not just to have a better future , but to have a future that permit human being to live in a safe world . i know that it is just a dream and nothing is going to happen in the next twenty year , but i know for sure that i am not the only one that think about that . i think we are growing and we are convicing other people that we are still going in the wrong direction .
