i think it is a very positiv point of view and i complitly support it . only lazy poeple sit on what they have , and look where they are at . .. i think that you do not lose any thing except a little bit of money by trying new thing . what i mean is that you actualy have a lot of chance to fail but if you success you can make a lot of money and that is how poeple see you . i would have to take for example for this point mr. bill gate who ha tryed to revolutionate computer and a result he is the wealthyest person on the planet . i could also take my mother a an example , everytime she try a new recepy , it is not always good but this way she get better . because i can tell her what went wrong or what should she add . could you imagin a world where no one would neither invent nor change anything ? that world would be the lazy 's world . i would get bored after one second . one day someone told me : '' it is by making mistake that you will get better '' and until now nothing ha proved him wrong ! he also sed : '' you can never fail , the only thing you can do wrong is not to try ! '' i ' actualy glad i met that person because since then , i have just been going forward in life and in sport . after that i think it is also a way of life and i think some poeple or born with desire and some are not . i have rarelly seen poeple learn that kind of thing . i am going to have to take my brother a example : my parent and i think he is talented in a lot of thing but he just doe not expend his knowledge .
