i do not agree with the statement . the reason are three which are written below . first reason of disagreement is not to be able to choose place where i visit . places where we want to visit might be different by each person . however , we have to dicide one place if we are led by a tour guide and travel a a group . in addition , a tour guide explain about someting i am not interested in at all . i want to travel wherever i want and i want know that i really interested in . i can ask to people who are familiar with the place instead of a tour guide . second reason is responsibility . in a group we have reasponsibility a a group member . we can not do something selfish and have to follow a tour guide . however i can go aroud freely if i travel by my self . the responsibility is only for me . when i went to washington d.c. , i wanted to visit some ghetto place . we should go out in a group . however i can not take responsibility for my friend if my friend and i go some ghetto place and bad thing happen . therefore i went around by myself . third reason is about time . when we travel in a group led by tour guide , our travel will be scheduled like `` 6:00 p.m. visit musium '' or '' 9:00 p.m. eat dinner . '' however , how much time we want spend will change by each person . because of those three reason which are choosing place , responsibility and time . the idea of statemant is not confortable for me and i do not agree with the statement .
