i agree with try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . the world is changing very fast . do you think that you can live without the advance of skill or technology ? i do n't think so . the poeple are becoming more intelligence and talented than those of 100 year ago . human being are always want to be advanced . first of all , even primitive people invented a lot of thing to eat , hunt and retain the stuff . at first , they probably did n't know how to turn on the fire . they tried several time to get what they wanted to have . if they had not tried to get the fire , nobody would have gotten it . second , to live twentyfirst century is not easy , and thesedays the competitiveness is very fierce . the technology is advanced very high and everyday new product are coming to attract the customer eye . even if someone ha very unique skill , sooner or later the other person will imitate these skill or invent new skill . everyday is different , we have to invent new stuff and think of new idea . if no , we will never win others . finally , a i just said , now is very hard to be successful person without inventing our skill . we must know one thing before inventing something . we probably will fail sometimes while we are doing something . it can be happened . even though we fail , we have to keep make an effort to get what we are thinking . to invent news thing or skill , people have to be very brave and take risk . for the first time , they might fail to invent but they do n't have to give up inventing . if they give up because of the scare of the fail , they will never be grown and get what they really want . being a successful person is not esay , we have to keep doing until we get what we think .
