some of the student try to understand the idea and concept rather than in learning the fact . and some of them feel that fact are important than the idea and concept . the idea ha importance in his own way a they are important when you are in a dilama and the concept of idea is o.k.and when come to the fact it tell the truth that had happenned in the past . ideas and concept are important to the student where they can react to the situation in a few minute and overcome to solve the problem which we are in . the idea and concept they try to improve our ability of thinking and help in the research process which is the main thing that is cosidered one of the important thing that ha to be remembered . facts these tell about the thing that are goi happened and is going to be happened in the future . this also is important for the student to learn . i agree with the idea and the concept than learning the fact . it help in developing the student individually in thinking and decision making as we observe in today society the thing are changing rapidly , so inorder to over come the idea and the concept play a very much important in student carrer . sharp idea and the concept make a student to settle in a better position rather than fact . i conclude that from the above disscussion that both are important in there own way . some think that idea are important where some think fact are important for the student .
