how many time do you see advertisement a day ? recently we live in the flood of advertisement and it is true that sometimes they can be very useful information to buy something new . however , it is not good to trust every fact which is in the advertisement . most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . showing their product seem better than they really are can be considered a a marketing strategy . there are too many product which have the same function in the world , and if they want to sell their product , they need to make the advertisement of their product which ha the same function but ha to seem much better than other product . the problem is from that point . they decide to lie in order to sell their product more and the customer who buy that product wil be cheated . i had an experience to buy a set of equipment for cooking . in the television advertisement , it looked like magic . show-hosts could to everything with those eqipments easily and it worked very well on tv . and also the product wa much cheapper than other product which were selled in real shop . however , i could not do anything well with the same equipment . the knife which had special purpose were worse than a knife which i had used before them , and i could use several type of pot and pan only for two or three month . and then , i had to buy new equipment . even though it is true that advertisement are necessary to show someone 's product widely and easily , there should be only truth in the advertisement .
