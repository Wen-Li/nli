i do completey agree with the statement presented here . a successful person is he/she who take risk at almost all the time . he is also a person who try to try different thing and venture out in to different area . to be a successful person once , twice or thrice you can always do what you already know how to do well or do the same thing inthe same area without taking any risk , but if you need to be a suucessful person all the time , you need to take risk . all the successful person 's like edison , einstein to say few have always thought on different topic and concentrated on area where little people have ventured out . one of the most successful person 's in the human history is thomas alva edison . he ha more than 200 patent to his credit . he always thought differently and ha taken risk too . if he ha not ventured in to different thing and taken risk we would not have seen the bulb till date . every electronic device that work 's today is courtsey , edison . a person on the other hand who always doe the same thing and is not interested in taking risk at any time can be a brilliant person and may be a good person , but can not always be a successful person . another example of the most successful person is of albert einstein . he wa the person who constantly had to live with risks . he even faced execution in his own country and had to fly away to another one to save his life . this wa one of the risk that he ha taken in his life . i always beleive in the above saying of `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . if people of this world ha not taken any risk and not worked differently then today we would not enjoy the beauty of this life.i.e life with material world .
