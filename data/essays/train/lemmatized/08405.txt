the trend of our society is to become older and older due to the fact that the number of birth is strongly decreasing year by year . in this kind of society , according to recent statistic , old people try to continue to behave a they did when they were young some year ago , while young people tend to wait more rather than to be active . notwithstanding the result of this statistic , i strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do . they have the opportunity to get in connection with more people a well to have strong motivation to do new thing . first , young people have the chance to have good physical mobility . this allows them to profit of sport activity that can give many satisfaction . as an example , they can profit of scuba - diving and see the beauty of the sea or they can have a wide view from the sky when they perform some parachute activity . in addition , thanks to their mobility , they can reach different and new place and enrich their culture of precious , brilliant and peculiar image of world 's gem . second , young people have more satisfaction from doing thing a they have probably experienced some situation only few time in their life . as in all new activity , they have an adrenalinic peak in their body that make them feeling happy . that creates a virtous schema : the statisfaction implies also a strong motivation to do new thing and viceversa . therefore we know , from a recent survey done in italy , that more than the 50 % of young people under 35 year are eager to do at least one new activity or a travel in a not visited country per year . in conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older peole do because they are eager to do new experience and have the physical mobility to do that . becoming older , they become more experienced but lost the motivation and the commitment to exploit life .
