it ha been well-established that successful people want to push their limit to the maximum and feel more and more sensation . i will develop and explain why i believed in this statement by using two main reason illustrated by example . the first reason is the money and the second one is the popularity . it is widespread that success go with money . successful people evidently are one of the part of the society where there is the le problem with money . indeed , some of them ( without thinking ` most of them ' ) become disgusted to have what they want , to do everything they want , to own , to buy , to offer , to live what they want to . that is the first reason why this people try new thing and take risk . they own lot of thing so they want always more and the only way for them to feel alive is to push their limit . it is to be out of bound , to show to everybody that they can easily do what they want , more than buy what they want . by knowing and understanding this way of thinking , it permit me to go on the second reason why they are acting a extremely a a professional skateboarder , surfer , snowboarder or others extreme sport . it is due to their popularity . besides being able to buy anything they want , they are proud of their ego and of the fact that unknown people love them . even though they are successful , they are also conscious on the effect they have on others who do not succeed . and they use it to prove to everyone that they can be more than someone who succeed . so they try new thing and take unconscious risk to confirm that anyway they are a part of people they definetely succeed . i would like to conclude that i understand them . i do not mean i feel successful but except money and popularity i love feeling me alive by looking for new sensation , taking risk ( always under law and rule , of course ) and prove to myself that i can do ` extra-things ' like no one else .
