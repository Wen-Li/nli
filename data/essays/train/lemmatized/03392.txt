well , a may thing , it depends from which angle you are looking at . most people have an image in mind that is described by the following feature : a video game playing young society that spends most of it freetime in front of a tv or a computer . it is not just the medium but frequently member of the parental generation who consider their offspring `` asocial '' , `` apolitical '' and `` unaware '' of the thing going on in the world . telling from my personal experience , i really have to be at issue with stating that young people of my and the following generation do not dedicate enough of their time in helping their community or showing any other sign of social interest and awareness . since 2001 , i am a member of the human right organization amnesty international and in the course fo my work there , organization such a amnesty for instance nowadays observe an increase in young people willing to spend their time writing letter , participating in urgent action to help freeing political prisoner around the world ( or at least bettering their living condition ) and taking action for those who suffer and are excluded from any satisfying of their basic need . i came to learn a lot of student and teenager of my generation who joined regional group because of being highly aware of the unjust thing going on in the world and who want to change a little something to the better . through friend , i also experienced a large interest in social profession among young people , showing that they are absolutely not unaware of the problem in society and that they are doing their best to bring about some change . one prominent example may be the civil service in germany , which mean that young men can choose between serving in the army or doing social work . most of my male friend decided for the latter . ok , you may say , they made the decision under pressure taking the more comfortable solution . plus , in our society social task are mostly assigned to woman , wheras men litterally have to be forced to deal with task where `` soft skill '' are needed . this is a very shortsighted concept of our reality if you consider the growing number of young people of both sex ( ! ) who are a member of their local student club defining principle of the university policy or who are engaged in their community by contributing their idea to local parliament . another striking example is volunteering in organization in your own country or abroad where young people help to develop a better infrastructure in third world country for example , by buliding school , teaching class , working in hospital and so on . .. therefore , to conclude , i do not agree with the image of young people being lazy , unaware of problem going on around them and / or being too reluctant of taking action in local or regional parliament or lobby .
