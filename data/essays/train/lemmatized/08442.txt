the best way of travel is in a group led by a tour guide . some poeple think like that , and other onces think that is better travel with a group of poeple but without a tour guide . i am agree with the first statement by some reason . first , you may have a good schedule of fun activity . if you like to travel and if you are an organized person , you will like to have an schedule with all your activity , and also someone who show you the best part of the city , explain their history , the good and bad thing , the meaning of the place , etc . by following a schedule you may have all your time planned , and you can have the opportunity of visit a lot of part . in a second point , traveling in a group is very fun . if you do not know any poeple , is a good opportunity to meet some friend , share experience , know poeple of different part of the world , understand different culture and also you can practice a foreign language . finally , and no le important , you can save a lot of money by traveling in a group led by a tour guide . all poeple know that travel on this time is very expensive , and if you travel in group , you will have some very good advantage like saving money in the hotel , or in your transportation . so if you save money , you have the possibility of travel two or three time in a year , and that is really fantastic . like a conslusion , i can say that all poeple or the most of the poeple love to travel around the world . is very excited to think on having the opportunity of visit a lot of city , meeting poeple of different culture , even learn about history , and of course saving money . that is why i think that the best way of travel is in group led by a tour guide .
