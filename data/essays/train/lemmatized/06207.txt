i completely disagree to the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for 3 reason . first , i often see many product written `` no fat '' or `` no chemical '' on the paccages . when i bought some pack of yogult written `` no fat '' on their paccages and ate one of them , i felt that it wa too sweet to eat and it must contain fat . second , the advertisement want to increase benefit . if they put some word that fascinate consumer on their product , the consumer would buy them ; even though , those word are actually not real . especially for the consumer who are interested in health or environment . finally , many consumer always try to buy better product . the advertisement know that , so they put fascinative word on the paccage . these are because that i think the advertisement do n't make better product than they really are . i want to them to make the believable product .
