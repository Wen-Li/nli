everyone work for an aim , this aim is called success or becoming successful . we all want , try and work for it . have you ever thought of the first and the best comman qualification of successful people ? i thought and share with you : always try new thing , be creative and have self-confidence to take risk . when you look around you will see the most successful one are the one who take the radical idea and do not worry to give life to them . first ; the old needings of human are the best reason for new thing . if you do not worry about if it will be liked by everyone you will become a great candidate for a successful people . for example when the television first invented nobody thougt it would spread so rapidly but the inventor belived and now we see what happened clearly . secondly , new thing mean creativity and i belive you do not need anything in your entire life if you had creativity . creative people always achive success , near or far one day they see it help . for example in the tv competition called survivor : it is a coompetiton about human against nature : there is an island and men with nothing . the competitor are similar in their physical condition but their creativity make the difference . lastly , taking risk . if you do not worry about others thought and have a selfconfidence there is nothing to stop you to success . in my country there is a man without arm and leg he lost them in a train accident when he wa 5 . but now he is one of the greatest swimmer of my country hemaybe compete in olympics soon . he did not mentione the risk can occure when he wa swimming . all he ha is self-confidence and belief in himself . consequently , i think successful people try new thingns , are creative and ha enormous self-confidence to take risk . if you have these qualification i believe one day you will be very successful too .
