if i wa plan to have trip , i would like to travel in a group led by a tour guide . in the modern life , when people want to have a trip they always face this problem that whether travel in a group led by a tour guide or travel by themselves . it is easy for everage people to choose travel by themselves , because they can spend their time on whatever they want and however they want . but if you can find out the advantage of travelling in a group led by a tour guide you will know it deeply . the first advantage of travelling in group led by a tour guide is that people do not need to catch the plane , book the hotel and so on . the tour company will take care of that , and people do not need worry about missing plane the tour guide will mention you when it is ready to go . besides travelling in a group led by a tour guide is savetime . because the tour guide know that where is more interesting that you should spend more time to visit . and the tour guide can explain the background of the landscape well , because they were trained by the company and special school . finally , it will save lot of money if people choose tracvel in a group led by a tour guide . usually when people give the money to the tour company . the money will cover the ticket , the hotel , and meal , and the tour company can get much more discount than you get . so it 's really a goodway to travel in group led by a tour guide . athough it also ha drawback , such a people can not spend time in the way they want . but it is said that `` everythind ha two side '' both of these choise ha there advantage and disadvantage . but by giving the reason a above . it 's fair to say that travel in a group led by a tour guide is a better choise .
