if one want to be successful in business , one need to take some risk and try new idea or concept . however , successful people can not limit themselves to what they already know a their environment is evolving in parallel . they need to constantly adapt and can not only focus on what they already know how to do well . therefore , they need to learn and try new thing . in a business , this becomes very obvious with the illustration of the development of the business . for instance , bill gates ( microsoft ) originally provided operating system . nowadays his firm also provides antivirus , new environment ( . net ) and so on . everytime he introduces a new product on the market , there is an underlying risk related to different uncertainty : how the product will be received , the quality of the product . .. however , if one start something totally new , one need to have enough knowledge to control the situation and anticipate upcoming problem . at least , one need to ensure that knowledge and information are within their reach when needed . on the one hand , steve jobs ( easyjet ) show that entrepreneurship and motivation can be enough to become successful but there is no guarantee . he created easyjet based on a simple concept : cheap flight . on the other hand , the disappearance of ten per cent of small and medium enterprises , five year after being created , show that the risk must be measured and calculated . indeed , trying new thing is not enough , there must be a follow up and a constant evaluation of the risk to prevent from failure . to conclude , successful people need to have an initial idea . as the environment is evolving , the initiator will need to consider new area they might not know well in order to have their idea fit in this environment . thus they will have to try new thing and take risk , but they will not take blind risk .
