as time go by , many different education syles are coming up . they all aim to develop the learning process . the future of our society will be destined with our young generation ; therefore they should be given all the material to improve themselves . nowadays there are two conflicting idea about how to teach the student , to let them learn fact or to focus on the understanding of each concept . i definitely agree that it is more important to really understand the cause , the effect and the context of an issue , because it encourages self effort , research and improves learning . first of all , the student need to learn to do thing on their own . they have to work on it and participate in the learning process . if the teacher just give the handout to the child and let them memorize each fact , they would not benefit from it . the teacher should make them think , how this fact relates with the other topic . to take advantage from the lecture student need to generate idea about it on their own . second , the student will be encouraged to do research , when they get the concept and idea . the student might know that there is a fact of ` gravity ' , but if he also know how isaac newton ha found it , which thinking way he tracked and reached this solution , he will have the ambition to go further and try to create concept of his own . last thing to mention is about the efficieny of learning , facts or formula , which have been only memorized , are forgotten in a short time . but if the student is familiar with the concept and understands it fully , he can remember it even many year later . to conclude , we should be really careful about how we approach the student when teaching them , because it can affect our future and the best way to equip them with the information they need seems to making sure that they go beyond fact and get the concept and idea .
