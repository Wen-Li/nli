i disagree with the `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' statement . although the form , shape of car will always change with the choice and like of people the concept of car will always be there and the number of car on the street will increase until a restricting law passed on that . people have some everlasting relation with some object that they will never give up no matter what . and car is that type of an object . people got used to driving car , this is a pleasure for them and a different color in life . think of a telephone for instance we have internet and we have voip ( voice over ip ) technology which enables u to speak on internet without any cost and with anybody all over the world , did it cause in le number of phone at home ? or did it reduce the number of celluler phone sale ? i dont think so because people got used to speaking on the phone and this wont change at least this wont change in twenty year of time and people will go on talking on the phone just like driving their car back home . there might be other transportation alternative and they might be cheaper too in twenty year of time but that wont change the car sale , actually it might even increase because population of the world will increase . in conclusion we can think driving car a a all the time activity , it will not get fewer but increase .
