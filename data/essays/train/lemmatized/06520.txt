the statement that to understand idea and concept is more important than to learn fact is a contoversial one . on one hand learning fact is important get into the research made in the past on the other hand it is always saidthat thinking and understanding is the mother of all invention . how ever in my opinion it is better to understand idea and concept rater to learn it . the reason for my belief is , that if someone understand the topic and apply it the past experience help to memorize the thing . the best example i can think of is doctor it is the idea and practise that make him a good practioner , if he going to learn every thing he might be confused all the time . the second reason for my belief is , it is always easy to underestand the thing rather to mug them up . concept formation started right when he wa in school and it gradually build over the time and will not finish till the end of his life . it is scientifically proved that what we learn each day we memorize only 30 % next day and it will keep on decreasing with time . this happens to u during exam if a pereson is well active during lecture and do his home work regularly his performance is better than a person who worked last night of exam , the active learner can handle all type of question asked effectively and efficiently and a problem can occur for a person who did learn the answer of the question asked . last reason for my belief is , that in the field of research the knowledge is more important than the learned fact . the scholar always tested on this parametre , for fact there are book inthe libarary for reference , internet to search but no option for understanding . , it is his idea and concept which help him to succed in life . finally i strongly support the statement that `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' .
