most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are i agree with the above statement . today the best way to sell a product is through advertisement . so you have to show the product in a much better manner even though the product is not good . i will explain the reason in the following paragraph . first , for example advertising for a washing powder or liquid . in the medium whether it t.v or radio they advertise by showing that by using little amout of powder of liquid you can wash many clothes and make them shine a new . but in real you need more powder to wash the clothes to get rid of dirt and the about the shine , they do n't shine a they show on t.v. it only the mean to attract people by exaggregating the product . second , let take tele shopping a example in this they advertise product and explains it us and they also show how it work , and show the result , now let take exercise machine , they say by working on this machine you can build good muscle by showing the person in the t.v. but in real you can not make good muscle a they show on t.v. because they use only well trained and well build muscle man to advertise . sometimes it is difficult for u to perform some exercise because we need some trainer to help use do some excercises when you are doing for the first time . let talk about the drug they show on t.v . they advertise the drug by telling about the us and advantage but they do not tell about the disadvantage of the drug and the sideeffects of the drug , who should take the drug all this information is not advertised on the medium . because you are creating a negative impression on the drug . in conclusion i like to say that watch the advertisement do some research on the product and then plan to buy the product . in this way you do n't waste time and money behind the product that never give you the result . so think while you act .
