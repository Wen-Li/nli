nowadays , it is not a rare for u to read and hear that some young people , even at such an early age , say 15 , are able to gain their reputation a a champion in sport event , or make great success in acadamical field . also , there are some adult critisize that adolencents do noting but merely enjoy the modern luxary life . personally , i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do , since the era we are living in ha greatly advanced . first , because of the progress of the society , there are more aboundant resorces than in the past . in other word , young people are able to take good advantage of all the condition that the society offer to them . for example , a 16-year-old boy would go to the bar , for almost everyday , to enjoy a cup of beer which cost him 20 dollar . while other student would regard the experience of driving an expensive car a their every day `` homework '' . yet all these are imaginable in their parent ' era . it is all because that we are living in a affluent society . second , the society advance not only in it material , but also people ' s spiritual status , that is , adolencents tend to hold different belief with the elder gerneration . while parent , who mainly live in the 1970s , regard hard work a a viture , their kid would despise at such an idea . what they want is to buy a new-style adidas sneaker , simply to follow their idle in the advertisement . we do not reject the possibility there are still a small proportion of adolencents a dillegent a their parent , but the fact that more and more people choose enjoying life a their belief is not denniable . third , the financial independence is another factor contributing to young people 's enjoying-life belife . if it were not for the ability that young people make mony themselves , they could not have gone so further in purchasing expensive product . modern society provides more opportunity for young peopel to work , with the money they earn always go with them to the shopping center .
