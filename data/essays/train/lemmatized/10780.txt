at the same time that company are producing more product , it ha been necessary in order to be competitive in the consumer world to create effective way to advertise them . in that pressure generated by company , they are producing product that seem to be much better in the advertisement than they really are . although not all product can be categorized with the statement , i agree with it . one reason to explains this , it is to see how food company advertise it product . to be more specific , we could use mcdonalds advertising campaign . on these , the way that a burger is presented is much better comparing with the same burger that you buy at any restaurant . the size , the color , the ingredient are not compared with the one that you see on the tv ad . on the other hand , because this effective advertisement are reproduced in more revenue , company keep using them in order to mantain growth . and that continue behavior is generating confusion among the consumer that rely usually on these ad to buy some product . another reason why company are using this strategy is that tipically they have competitor . all of them want to improve their sale by producing this type ad that definetily convince people to buy product . therefore , the market department on this company start to develop this type of ad that are necessary in order to mantain a good position in the market . although company usually rely on this type of method , others think that this is unethical and never try to reproduce or show better quality in their product . furthermore , some product may not applied in this type of ad so for them it is not possible to use that strategy . for example insurance advertising . they just can show what advantage they have . these are according with the reality . finally , in order to protect consumer right , several institution have been created . they rule and measure way that product can be shown , and also they must be conform with the reality . however , these institution have not been enough to control this type of business behavior and this still occur in the us market .
