i agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . previously young people were interested in issue about their community . however , a the time go by , a the technology develops young people start getting interested more with their own issue . integration of modernization and technology can be a reason for this change of interest . tthus these two can be responsible for the decreasing time that is spent for helping the community . first of all , the world is changing in a way that people are getting lonelier . for example , most of the people , both mother and father , are working now . children are left alone at home during the working hour and this make the child to learn to live by his own . this result in childrens only thinking themselves and child interested in their own isssues . in the long term being alone lead to a society composed of young people who are isolated from the world , only sharing their inner world with the poeple like them . thus a a result of this moderniation in the society , working parent , living in a big city , lead young people to be individualistic . another reason for the decrease in help of young people to their community is the development in technology . the development in technology also lead young people to live isolated from the world . as i described above , the child left home alone play computer and video game . they all have some kind of virtual caharacters and they are much more concerned with their vitual caharacters rather than their community . young people nowadays have more problem regarding themselves than the young people of the past . thus , they are helping themselve before they try to help their community . to conclude , with the modernization which lead to loneliness and the development in the technology which increase the loneliness are the main reason for young people to behave individualistically . this behavior prevents young people to give enough time to helping their community .
