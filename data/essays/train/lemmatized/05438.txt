the next twenty year are not a big span of time to show major change in human act toward technology and toward global interaction . but a a matter of fact and a the world is getting flattened i think that people of the third world will learn from other nation how to get organized and establish a well , advanced infrastructure in the field of trasportations , a they act a an obstacle for decreasing the number of car in my openion . as we see in cevelized country all class of society even the wealthy people us public transportation because it well organized and the people are well educated about the polution issue and they not only but act about it , but on the other hand we see how in the third world people brag about there 18 year old kid ha his own car . but thanks to evolution in every aspect of life , people are learning from eash other and a petrolium is getting higher in price , nation are getting advice from eash other on how tosave energy an making a verey advanced transportaions like bus and train . for an example i used to reach a certain place which is away from home 5 min. by the car in 35 min when i take the bus due to lalk of organization but now after five year it improved to ake me 10min which is acceptable . anyhow i am optimistic about a future with le car and the key to that is by well educating the people about the problem being encountered by the increasing number of car , and to offer them a convenient substitution .
