i think that succesfull people always try new thing and take risk . as a matter of fact everybody can do what he already know . it is very easy repeating something many time , it is like to copy ; but every man is able to copy . and how can something that everybody can do getting you to be a succesfull people ? i think the answer is that it ca n't . moreover nothing can be done radically better whitout making a change . without changement there could not be innovation and improvement . i think it is the same in the human condition : a person will always remain in the same condition without trying new thing . that is not a characteristic of sussesfull people that , instead , always try to improve their condition . naturally taking risk is not a synonimous of having succex . someone succed in improve his condition , on the other hand another man fail . but to become a succesfull man it is necessary to try . however this imprevedibily is another point in favour of my theory . if try new thing would get automatically to a succex condition , why some man do not try them ? the answer is simple : there is the risk to fail . fail mean get you in a worse condition . and only a few man can risk to become in a worse condition . so only few man become succefull people . in conclusion only try new thing can change man condition . it could become better or not . changing it in a better way mean improve your condition and improve your condition make you a succefull man .
