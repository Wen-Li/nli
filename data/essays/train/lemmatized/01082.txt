in my opinion young people nowaday do not give enought time to helping their community . generation after generation people ere more and more selfish . they think only by and for theirself . ecology , senior and underpriviledge people are gived up by young people today . since the first period of the history , human ha decided to live in community . but until this time community ha grown more and more and then they had been dislocked . people ha forgotten how and why we lived in common . the reason wa a better way of life in the best possible environment . nowaday , senior are older and more lonely than before . however , they are our history and we have a lot to learn from them . children should take care of them to learn their own family history and to have enough culture in order to do not the same mistake done in the past . for example , in my family without the help of my grand father i never should have known how and why the world war 2 wa . memory is a way to never do that again . underpriviledge people should be helped too . anyone could be in the same case during his life so a child must learn : do what you would like that people should do for you . morever , in those day helping community is necessary to go on to live on earth . the temperature are higher , the water disapear and a lot of natural ressources too . young people must give some time to help their planet and rescue it . they can clean the beach or learn to the other people what is bad im their day life for the planet . in summary , communatory service have a lot of good side . to help
