that is a difficult question because i think it belongs to different community . in some region i would agree with that statement because there are political problem that help to let the problem grow . there you find child who grow up without a father or a mother and no one who care about the young child . i understand that these child have no interest to help their community when they are older because no one helped them . otherwise it could be that especially that people search in community for help and if they find some they are pleased to help the community if the help is needed . furthermore often you find good condition in wealthy region . why ? i think they have not that problem like people who have to work hard for every little thing . these people live through the day without thinking how they survive tomorrow . in my eye young peolpe spent a lot of time to help there community . please do not missunderstand me . but i think if people have not that all day problem , they are able to spent more time in helping there community of course . furthermore there is an other problem . the television show how the young people have to live today . an there you see often that the child or young people work alone or spent more time with other think a to help their community . on one hand our community want that we are succesfull in what we make and often that is only possible if we do that alone and if we spent a lot of time for that but on the other hand the community sais that we have to spent our time for them . i think that is not possible . each person ha to think about what for him is importent an where he want to focus on . if both direction are equal you have the best way to success in that community . conclutioned i want to say that every person ha to find his own way and especially the young people because they grow into that community with their choice .
