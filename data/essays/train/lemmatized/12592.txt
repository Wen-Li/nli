i do not agree with the following statement because if i travel in a group led by a tour guide , i can not go to place which i want to go . moreover , i can not late the time that the tour guide decided . if i wa late , i will give influence against other people . therefore , i have to see the place or buy some thing quickly . i think it is boring , and it is a west of time . i also think it is not interesting trip , so i may not be able to remember the trip forever . when i went to london with a group , i could not see the place which i wanted to go , and i bought a few thing because of time . i thought if i have more time , i can buy more , so i wa unhappy . moreover , i do not like to travel with a group because if i travel in a group , i have to talk other people or think about them , so it make me tired . if i travel myself , i do not need to talk other people . therefore , i think it is the best to travel o
