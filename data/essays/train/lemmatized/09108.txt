today , people use their car for everything . short distance a well a longer one . moreover , people do really enjoy their car , we can see it every morning and night when there is a lot of traffic , they prefer staying in their car to using public transport . so they love them and they take care of them a a precious object . nevertheless , i strongly believe that in twenty year , the number of car in the road will sharply decreased , not because people will be willing to give up their car but because they will no longer have the choice . first of all , the price of gas . we 're experiencing a new era , where the price of petroleum reach a level never reach before . the increase of the gas price is badly and harshly felt by the population . petroleum become more and more expensive meanwhile people become poorer and poorer mostly because of unemployement . so that , gas becaume a luxuary good and fewer person can offer it . soon , only rich people could offer it . moreover , environmemtal concern become more and more important . indeed , polution ha rech a rate never reached before . for instance , france during summer period , when it 's warmer , ha to ask it citizen not to take their car in big city such a paris and to take public transport or bike if they have to move , or even move by foot , because the polution rate is too high . if they have to drive it is recommemded to take more tham one passenger inside the car . the french authority have to rely on the environmental conscious of the citizen . nevertheless , a the polution rate is not suppose to decrease in the near future and a the climate is suppose to be warmer than it use to be , i am sure that people wo n't be able to use their car a often a they would like to . for all these reason , even if people are not willing to give up their car , they will no longer have the choice in twenty year .
