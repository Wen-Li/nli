people always have liked to travel , but there are two principal way to do that , travel in a group led by a tour guide or travel alone . both way have advantage and disadvantage . when people travel in a group , they have to follow all the instruction of the tour guide . they have to start and finish the experience at the same hour , and if somebody doe not like the rule , he can not do anything for achieve his wish . there is no freedom . for example , in the rome 's tour , there is not time to visit all the place in the city , the tour only visit the coliseum and the vatican . however , if you like the speech from the tour guide , you can enjoy the experience a lot , because you do not have to look for the interesting site and it history or it data , the tour guide provides it them to you . this way to travel is so easy and comfortable . altough many people prefer the way to travel alone , because they do not have to follow another group . they decide all that they will do by themselves . they use a map , a tourist book or the advice of some friend . they visit all the place that they want and stay there one day or one year . in this way to travel you can spent your time or your money in your deepest wish , your doubt about some place and culture or attending your necessity . in my opinion , i think that it is the best way to travel , because i have the freedom to chose what site i will visit , what food i will eat , what time i will spent and at what hour i will wake up and i will start my experience . for example , i want to visit quintana roo but the group led by a tour guide probably visit cancun in the morning not either tulum in the midnight .
