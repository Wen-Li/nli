young people enjoy life more than older people do . i do support the following satement . young people enjoy their life in different pattern than the older people do . the old age people mostly prefer to spend their time by taking the rest instead of enjoying their life , the old peopleprefer to take rest is mainly because of their health problem , they mostly prefer to concertrate on keeping their health in a balanced state instead of enjoying . their daily schedule is widely different fro the young people , their daily life is more common compare to child and the young age people . the old age people are unable to play game a do like the young people . the old age people mainly want to stay home and do the gardening , their life doe not resemble most to the young age people . most of the young people enjoy their life in different fashion , by wearing different kind of clothes , by visting theatre and chit chatting with the friend . the young people enjoyment is highly unique compare to the enjoyment of old age people . the old people have le compliance than young people eg : old people showing least preference to visit outside viewing , going to the dance party , doing different innovative thing . today the life is more modernized than few century ago , more enjoyment in the life is widely seen in the young people than old age people . as per my personal beleif is that , theyoung people enjoy their life more than old people do . once again i strongly do support this statement by agreeing .
