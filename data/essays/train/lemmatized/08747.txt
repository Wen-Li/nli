personally i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than to specialize in one specific subject . that is because if you know a little bit of many topic you can cope with very different situation and that could be very useful nowaday . speaking about job , an example of what i said before is the role of the project manager : the project manager ha to manage a project and meet the given deadline timely and with proficiency . in doing so he is expected to deal with a lot of contractor each of them with a specific cultural background that is likely to be different to his own one . nevertheless his general culture and his general experience can lead him to command the situation and to coordinate successfully so many different people and expertise for the sake of the entire project . someone could object that your broad knowledge make you become a recipient in which information is not processed and is just not deep enough to be retained . well , to those people i would say that , on the contrary , that the accumulating of information and the interaction with a lot of people with different knowledge will power my original knowledge making it more and more accurate than we could think at first . in fact the real knowledge is to conclude i would say that the best choice to succeed in the today world his to be flexible and in order to be flexible you need to have a 360 degree view that enables you to overcome situation which you wouldn ' t be able to overcome looking at the problem just from one point of view , no matter how much deep and specialistic that could be .
