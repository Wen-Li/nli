i strongly agree with the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . actually i think that trying new thing is the most important thing to do to become successful . if a person try new experience and discovers new thing , then he or she ha the possibility to learn to do those thing very well and to develop them becoming successful in doing those thing . as a result this person would be considered a pioneer by other people in the `` area '' she 's working at . for example , to become successful a manager could find out a new way of running his business : for istance he could try to improve the method of working , to decrease cost or to make people work harder by using promotion . this manager would be recognized a a successful person because he ha discovered a new way of working that allows the factory to save money , time and to do better . moreover i believe that successful people are used to taking risk more than other people do because of their enthusiasm for new situation and because they have an optimist view of the situation that they have to face with . in fact being an enthusiastic and optimistic person help to face new situation and help working out good solution to problem . for example , if a manager strongly belief in what he is doing , i 'm pretty sure that he will achieve his aim ; if this manager stongly belief in his decision , he wo n't stop working when he will meet difficulty or problem , but he will work harder to find a solution and go on doing what he ha planned to do . in conclusion , i completly agree with the statement above and i think that only successful people could improve and bring new aspect in the world because doing always the same thing , though it is well done , doe n't bring , in a long time , new idea and consequently improvement at all .
