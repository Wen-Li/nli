i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . examples from academic theory , successful enterprise and real life proove the validity of that statement . for instance , on stock market there is a rule that state that it is more likely to get more return when accepting more risk . whereas if you invest your money in a secure option , your yield will be fairly le . this theory of the positive correlation of risk and return can be easily transferred to successful business model . amazon . com , for instance , is a good example of a successful company . the founder of amazon . com took a great risk in investing their money in this project . the idea of selling book online wa completely new and no one knew if this business model would succeed . another successful entrepreneur is bill gates . creating microsoft wa very risky , because the use of personal computer wa still new at that time and bill gates could not be sure about the selling success of his programms . trying new thing and taking risk in everyday life , will increase one person ' ability to react to unexpected situation . it will thus reinforce one person ' self-esteem and self-conciousness , which are important characteristic in today society . a person will more easily succeed in it personal life since that person will be able to face and resolve problem with le fear . in my opinion , all these example proove that trying new thing and taking risk contributes possitively to success .
