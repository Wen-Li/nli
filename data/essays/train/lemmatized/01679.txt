i do not agree with the statement : young people enjoy life more than older people do . even though the young certainly are in better position to enjoy life in term of their physical condition , that is better health than the old , but this is clearly not the only factor to enjoy life . let me provide a few reason i do not agree with the statement . first of all , one great factor to enjy life is financial resourses . to put simplest , it is very difficult or even impossible to enjoy life to the full without enough money . this is obvious , because , say , who would pursue enjoyment f life under serious financial pressure or with constant worry about making both end meet . under that kind of circumstance , it would be realistically very challenging to do so . since most , if not all , of the old have relatively more financial resource that they have acccumulated by year ' of employment , saving , property , etc. , they are in better position to enjoy life than most young peple in term of financial resorces . secondly , a they have lived long enough to know what life is , they generally have better or more appropriate perspective , value , insight into life . quite obviously , with their extensive expereince of all sort and education , learning , and so forth , they do have wisdom , which is so important and valuable in living a god life . this is definitely a positive factor in enjoying life to the full .
