we ca n't undertand each others and also new idea . in my opinion , this is the biggest problem for global world . i strongly agree with the statement that `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' first of all , student have to learn idea before the effect . because if they did n't learn the idea ofcourse they ca n't guess the effect . the biggest scientist einstein said : `` understanding problem is fifty percent equal to solving problem '' . the biggest example come to mind is my college year . i 'm industrial engineer and i wrote 2 book about lean production and value stream mapping . i went to ford 's factory but i could n't make a good job because i had n't understand the ford 's manufacture system . when i solve the system i catched lot of mistake in the production . second of all , if student understand the idea after they try to learn this idea effect and they check the effect for daily life . when i learned the game theory for economy firstly i started to use for my own company and i learned all effect .
