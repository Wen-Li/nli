yes , i agree with statement that young people enojy more than older people . at the young people enjoy lot with the friend by going movie , by parting but the older people a to there work in the office and had to see the family problem , finacial problem and at that they ca n't enjoy . young people will enjoy more because they had no family , finacial problem the only is to study but this is not big problem a they can do by suding before exam until they can play , can do party , go to movie , can go to tour . as young will not going to come young people remember these thing in the old age . example , for the young people enjoy than older is , in school day we did more thing in the school with my friend such a to make joke and make fun with others but we manage the people whom we make fun atlast . finally , they also doe not take seriously and doing this we can get fun a we able recollect these thing at the older age . another example is when we tour in school day we miss the way with teacher and we went to another place we had struck there for one day we had enjoy there by missing a we go to different place but fianlly we made our way that our teacher were , this is one which i will not going to forget . by watching movie we can enjoy lot a all the friend will be going to be there . another one where we enjoy is the party a all friend will gather there an do different thing and that joy will be not present in the older people even they do party , they only can say their problem finally , we must enjoy the young age a it will be not going to come again but only the rememberance what we had done in the young age
