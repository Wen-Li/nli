in recent year , some people argue that there will be fewer car in use in near future since the innovation in transportation technology . however , the argument seems me far from reality . although , there are some study in this direction , i do n't think that car which have an important place in our life can be replaced by easily in twenty year . the statistic and the project of government justifies my belief . first of all , our past experience challenge to the argument . if we look at the statistic to understand how the tendency of the number of the car in use is , we see clearly that there is a permanent increase in car usage . in other word , the statistic of past data doe not support the prediction in argument . it can easily be seen that all the statistic beginning from the invention of the car to today demostrates that the usage of car ha dramatically increased . when people have better economic condition , they desire to buy car . inceases in population in all over the world also served this tendency . secondly , nowadays many developing country continue to built new road . for instance , in my country - turkey - there are region where road are not even suitable for car and the government is too eager to expand the total kilometer of high way to make car usage easier . in this purpose they expense a significant part of the budget to the transportation project . this effort to increase high way and to make them secure made also the people more eager to use car . if we talk about a far future when there is no need to use car because of the adaptation of helichopters or a fututre where world ha connected with metro then we can expect the car to disappear . but , today they are crucial for our comfort and i ca n't see a vehicle that can replace car usage .
