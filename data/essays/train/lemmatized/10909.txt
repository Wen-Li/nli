it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because they will make lot of invovations in the field of science and technology . they can make the world a beautiful place to live in . firstly , man ha made a techniologicals deveopments by constant application of the concept and idea . for example , early human got an idea of wheel they applied this idea to cart for the transpotations purpose . after some generation this led to invention of the gear and rise of complex machinery with inovations such a car . another example is the concept of gravity which ha became extremely useful in the advancement of space exploration and understanding the feauters of the planet and what amount of . gravity is needed lif off some body or escape velocity for some satellite secondly , the concept of mathematics like additon , substraction , divide . made easy to analyse and sythesis the data and derive solution to our complex problem . for example , counting of money , article thus from the above reason , if the student understands idea and concept he can provide a solution to the complex problem that we are facing today .
