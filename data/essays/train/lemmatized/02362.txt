avertisement is a topic involved with marketing , and marketing is about creating long term relationship with customer . before focusing in advertisement , a company ha to create a marketing plan of how to reach the target market . if the marketing plan of a company is effective , the need for advertisement is not a big a the need of a company that ha a bad marketing plan . why do i involve marketing with the purpose of advertisement ? well , because a problem is only solved when the root of the problem are known . when a company ha a good marketing plan , that company will not have trouble reaching their target market and obtaining profit . starbucks is a great example . this company developed an excellent marketing plan according to their value and their objective . starbucks ha reached all their objective and without the need to use advertisement . they do not need to tell the people how good their product is because the people already know it . this example lead me to explain if i agree with the statement that `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' i do agree with the statement because advertisement will be used only if the product or service need it . a commercial for example will make product and service look better than they really are because that product or service need the consumer 's attention . of course i only agree with the statement because at the beginning of it , it say `` most '' . if the statement would not have that word , i would not agree at all . the reason i would disagree is because there are company like macdonalds that do not need the advertisement to sell their product , but they use them because the competition is huge , and they need their consumer to confirm why they are the best . advertisements are only use to catch the consumer attention , but it doe not mean that the product or service will be exactly a is shown . a person will only let himself believe everything he see and hears if that person doe not know why the advertisement exists in the first place . companies would do anything that is necessary in order to sell their product or service . in a few word , most company would do anything to be successful and make profit .
