i agree with that statement because of these reason . at first , understanding idea is really significant for student when they learn new study , for example , when i wa a high school student , i started learing physic . i t wa dificult for me to learn fact and formula withought understanding idea . i could remenber fact , but i did not understand and put into long term memory . however , when i wa taught the idea of physic by my friend , i could understand . i knew fact , so it wa easy to accompany that idea and fact . if i learned idea and concept first , i would remember important formula and fact for a long time . thus , understanding concept is more important for student . in addition . understanding idea and concept is helpful to student . when i took ` american government ' class , the instructor explained meaningful concept of this class befor telling fact . he introduced huge image of this corse , and he suggested idea of each term for this class . i am an international student , and i wa not used to american government , because his introduction wa really helpful for me . if he introduced just fact or fact , i would not get importance of this class and be interested in american government . therefor student can take advantage by understanding idea and concept . although learning fact is also meaningful , it doe not help student . when student want to know something , learning fact is useful because they do not have to spend much time . however , if they understand something , it doe not function . understanding idea and concept doe not mean only obtaining idea , but also learing fact . in my opinion , understanding and learing are accompanied with each othere . when student gain someting , they should understand that , and then they can learn fact deeply . thus , i agree this statement .
