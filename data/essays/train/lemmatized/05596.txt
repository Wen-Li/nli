firstly , i thing that having a broad knowledge of many academic subject may be , culturally speaking , really interesting but that it can also lead to a confused professional guide line in the future . therefore , the first objective that each student should have will be , to my point of view , to find out what they will be in ten year in order to have a clear objective during all their study . even tough , it is , obviously , really hard to now at 18 year old what you will be in the future , i profundly believe that the question should be raised carefully in order to create the student motivation . moreover , i do believe that at one stage or another we have to find out what we really want to do and then , in order to achieve , this objective to specialize ourselves . to take a simple example , at the end of my bachelor degree in foreign language i did realize that this section wa not diversify enough , so i decided to change for another direction : international commerce . my point , is that it is important to focus on a specific guide line but without being too specific . nevertheless , being stuck in a specific subject can be prove to be a handicaped for the search of a job latter on . in fact , for some subject a specification can put the student in a very difficult position , for example we all know that nowadays some department or branch or no longer relevant or can not be provided any more . students that are specialized in these subject will therefore have problem to find a job at the en d of their study and they will probably have to pas another university diploma to get a more general degree in order to find a job .
