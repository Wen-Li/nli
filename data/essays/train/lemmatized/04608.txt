i am disagree with the statement which it is more imoportant for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact . first of all , people are living in a realistic life surounding by realistic people , animal and environment . all the thing happen everyday which we can see and feel are fact but not idea or concept . so if we only know the the idea about the thing but do not know the fact which actually happening in this world , it will be difficult for u to live and well understand the world . secondly , to understand the idea and concept is the basic of our life . that 's why all of u have to go to school in the yung age an d learn all the idea on the textbook . however , when we learned at the school , we can usually find that sometimes the thoeries or law about the thing is not exactly ture in the real life . for example , the hooke 's law of the object and the consevation of the energy theory in the motion of a ball are all correct only if we condier in an ideally situation , which is no friction and no air resisitance . however these are not ture in the real life . we live in a world which ha friction almost everywhere . so when the scientisits build up the airplane or other machine , they have to obey the fact which occur in the realistic situation but not the idea in the book . if they do not consider about the friction and air resistance , the result will come out badly . another reason why i think to learn fact is more important because learning is more useful and effecient than just understand the concept . to learn the fact is taking a deeper step to better understand everything around u . why it happen ? how it happen ? by learnig a fact , we can discover many other interesting and useful imformations and fact which we do not know before to improve our knowledge level about the world and become more confidence and satisfied with people .
