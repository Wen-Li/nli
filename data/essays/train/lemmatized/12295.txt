although student in the same class take same course under identical circumstance in term of instructor , teaching aid and experience , and assigned textbook , two group of student may arise after that course . during and after the course , some student will focus on understanding idea and concept , while others will be content of accepting absolute fact undoubtly . i belong to the first type of student , and hence i strongly agree with the statement . when you take a course , whether it is at university or school , with intention in your mind to just receive passively new fact then to ga back home , then allow me to tell you that you are missing the point ! students who want the instructor to merely plug in data and information into their brain in class , with no deep and profound interest in the topic , are on their way to become dummy a machine . they will never raise relevant question in lecture nor participate actively in any class discussion . this , in effect , will lead them to the what so-called cramming . exam crammer may enjoy good result , in some situation , for a while , but they will regret it in the soon future . i believe that learning is about understanding new material , questioning result and fact , knowing how thing work or why they are the way they are , then moving to your own conclusion and evaluation . on the other hand , if your purpose of taking any course is to comprehend it to the most , then you are on the right track . students who dive into this deeper level of understanding will excell , not only in academic life , but also in the professional one . thorough examination of the topic you are studying will get you beyond mathematical equation , if you are studying technology , or beyond cluster of word and paragraph if you deal with literature . information will make much more sense to your mind , and you will feel the real power of knowledge when you study in order to understand , not just to pas the next exam . in conclusion , understanding the underlying concept and definition behind any learning topic is more solid and lasting than going through fact quickly . the benefit are promising and will become more evident in the student future .
