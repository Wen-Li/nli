i agree with the statement `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . let me begin by saying that time ha changed . in former time most of the people live in small village and everybody know each other . it wa common that young people help in their community . nowadays , for example in big city nobody really care about the others . they often do not even know their neighbour . so it 's difficult for young people to help . secondly in former day parent were stricter than now . young people had to help in their community , because their parent did it a well . they had no choise to do other thing they might prefer . and in my opinion this is a good system , because people at this age often do n't think of helping in their community . today parent let them decide theirselves if they want to help or not . and if it wa not expeceted to them , only a few people at this age are kind enough to help . i think parent play an important role at this question . last but not least nowadays people might have n't enough time to help their community . they have to go to school and after that they have to do their homework . today this could be a lot of work and in some area school last till late in the afternoon . after finishing this most child or teen just want to relaxe or do some sport . it might sound egoistic but they do not really care about their community . because they are still young i think they need to play after work and they do n't want to help anybody . in conclusion i agree with the statement because time have changed and people really do n't spend much time to helpnig their community .
