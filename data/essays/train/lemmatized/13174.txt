i feel that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to speacialize in one subject . the current era is changing and developing fast . it is growing at a rapid pace and in this changing world , one need to have information about everything and almost every field . i think that in this changing era , one ha to have the knowledge of almost every topic and field . human being is a social animal . he life in a society where he meet several people from different stream . if he doesnt have any idea about other field he cant even to talk to the person he meet . he need to have knowledge about the various stream . for example mahatama gandhi , a lawyer by profession had a diverse knowledge about various subject . he wa an excellent speaker , great dramatist and a great poet . he used all these skill to guide india to indepence . without the knowledge of these subject he could not have guidd india to indepence . one must have a broad knowledge of almost every subject . this is not only helpful in professional work , but also important for personal life . for example knowledge of geography can help one plan a vacation to an exotic location . physics is used in our daily life . chemistry can be really useful to one . one can undersatnd the politics better . one can understand politics better if he ha a knowledge of it . i support this opinion that knowledge of many academic subject is better than knowledge of one specialized subject .
