the question state that , thesedays , young people do not give enough time to helping their community . i agree with this statment . thesedays , i think because young people do not mind that , if their community get risk or something not like old people . actually they do not think their right to do for their community , people have right to vote , paying tax , in korea , men have to go to army . but some young people do not give to helping their community . firstly , young people do not go for voting for their community , they go for a trip or abroad instead , or some people go to migration to other country , so then they do not participate their community eventhough they have a right to vote . therfore the le people is vote for their community and they get unsatisfaction their head of community . secoundly , youn people do not pay their tax to their community . so then the community can not operate their work for the community . young people donot mind about the community . finally , in korea , men have to go to army when they over 20 year old , but some tuong people go to migration to ecape from the government that try to catch him because he doe not go to army . or sometimes they are try to get ill , so then they would not go to army . it is being the most big problem in korea . i agree that the young people do not give enough time to helping their community . it should be changed , and then all of the communitie can operate better .
