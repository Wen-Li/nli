when people travel our own country or the other part of the world , people often travel in a group and also take a tour guide with them . i agree with the idea about the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . although there could be some disadvantage about going in group . in my point of view , first of all , we need some information about the place that we are travelling . of course we can get information about almost averything on the internet , but it is so hard to get a very specific information and it will take up so much time and can be very stressful before traveling . but if we go in a group led by a tour guide , we can share some information with other member of the group and we can ask all the question we want to know about the place that we are traveling to the tour guide at the same time when we are traveling . secondly , we can spend our time very efficiently through the whole traveling time . because when we travel in a group , we can not travel without a schedule , and if we do not , it will be very disorganize with a lot of people . so we have to have a specific schedule . which make u feel very satisfied , after the whole travel . thirdly , we can get to know each others more that we did not know about before , while traveling in a group and there are economical advantage also . there could be some diadavantages about traveling in a group with a tour guide . for example , people might think that they can not have their free time and feel uncomfrtable about always moving in a group with a fixed schedule . however , it is better than being so stressful about getting information about the place ourselves and get lost in a new place we are traveling . consequently , because of all those reason i think the best way to travel is in a group that led by a tour guide .
