some people believe that having a broad knowledge in various academical subject may lead them to greater depth in their carreer . on the other hand , there are also many example of people concentrating on a single subject and specialize and make a carreer with it . in my opinion , studying for a specified subject would be a more efficient and wiser decision to make . for example , when you think yourself a a student who is having double major on two unrelated field , you 'll soon mix together what you have studied . the two essential of the two field would be congested . by the end of your study , you 'll not be able to specialize in either of the subject . you 'll just be able know the basic of them which is not the best thing the succeed in life . a further example of why choosing a single subject can be the attempting of a working carreer of your own in a certain field . for this to happen , you need to concentrate on a single subject at your academic career since you have to understand your subject with detail and from every point of view . this only occurs with specialization . therefore ' being ambitious in life , brings the need to specialize in a specified subject . if we look at the problem from a student point of view , some student believe that broad knowledge on many subject requires lot of time and a lot of sacrifice from social life . by this drawback , they easily select specializing in one subject . this could also be seen a a different reason of choosing a single subject to study . as we have seen from the example , it doe n't matter whether you are ambitious on specializing on a specified subject . the important thing is that , it is the wiser decision to take to reach what you are aiming in life . these aim can be listed a succeeding in working life , achieving on new discovery of your subject , specializing on what you studied or even being able to spare time at your university year . for sake of your aim , it is better to have a knowledge on specifis subject .
