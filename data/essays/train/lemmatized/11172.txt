i think it is depens on the kind of thing that you need to do . both have advantage and desavantages . for instance if we are talking about the president of a country is better to have broad knowledge of different subject , on the other hand if we are thinking on research or investigated an specific problem could be better to have someone specilized in the matter . having a broad knowledge of many academic subject allow people make decision with a wider range of thing to take in account , and would be good because you know more information . but the problem could be that you only have general information , then if it is necessary to have more detail you could be in troubble and it is for sure that you will ask for someone else to help you . specializing in one specific subject is excellent to solve problem related to an specific topic or activitie , because you need full data research and experience , however , many time it is helpful to consider a completly different topic or mechanism , for example to solve environmental problem in textil industry have been used many principle of tannery process . then the tannery industry saved some research time to textil industry it is mean , that always is better complement way to do the thing and to have both kind of academic formation , because each one is suitable and sometimes better for a differents purpose .
