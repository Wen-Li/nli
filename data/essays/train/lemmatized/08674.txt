in this essay , i will explain why i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . for this , i will say that younger people benefit from a better physical and mental health in general , then i 'll talk about the issue of the money and finally i 'll talk about the free time for those two category of people . first , it is well known that young people have a better health than older people . a good health allow someone to run , jump , make several sport and also to have a better resistence to alcool , illness or the need to sleep . this is why young people do much more sport and party than when they become old . after that , i 'd say that when we are young , we want to move , to travel or to try new experience . as you 're old , you 've already tried lot of thing , you may be le kind to try new challenge because you feel that you may not be able to do it . i sobserve it when i see my grandparent . they do n't move from their apartment because they do n't have the courage to do so . some people can say that older person have more money , that 's why they can do more thing . i totally disagree whith that because some of them do n't use their money at all and stay at home all the day . others may travel , for exemple i have a grand mother who travelled in india a few year ago . but it wa a well organized trip , the kind of trip where you always stay with the same people since the departure at your airport . i do n't think that this is the best way to discover and enjoy a new country . generally , if they have money , they use it the wrong way . finally , it is true that when you stop working , you have all the time you want to enjoy life but a i said before , it is not what happens in most case , particulary after seventy year old . on the other hand , when you 're young , you study or you start working . i think that this is not why you have le free time that you do n't use it well . and sometimes i feel better being with my friend in a classroom than alone watching a movie for exemple . these are the reason why i think that younger people enjoy life more than older peole do .
