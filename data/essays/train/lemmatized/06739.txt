according to me it is quite true that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the huge amount of industry that make the same or similar product have brought to a point where it is difficult to go on , so they ha started to find way to gain more money otherwise they will not be able to survive . as a result they ha begun to reduce cost of production and this mean also le quality in the product they make , but however to convince people to buy these product it is necessary they belief that this product are great ; to do this industry ha started to make advertisement that present a certain object a one of the best ever produced and it doe n't matter if it 's not true . a clear example about what i 'm saying is about mobile phone : the first mobile phone are n't so glamour like those we can find now , but they were really resistant and they could be used for year without any problem ; the new one instead are n't so resistant and ha a lot of problem and it could happen we have to change them after only a couple of year , but the advertisments about them paint another reality . according to these advertisement the product shown is the greatest ever sold and focus our attention on the innovation this object ha and also assure u it wo n't have trouble . another example is about car ; most of car producer when promote their new vehicle explains u all those thing that they have done well and that contributes to make u interested in this car , like speed , horsepower , acceleration , optionals and maybe after , we buy it , we know that is not safe in certain condition or it ha n't passed some test
