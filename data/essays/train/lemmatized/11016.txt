recently , it is more common to have a tour guide while travelling than going a trip without a tour guide . while some people like to have a tour guide to see many attractive site , in my opinion it is not the best way to travel in group led by a tour guide because of it ha lot of restriction . first of all , people travelling with a group led by a tour guide have a time constraint while travelling . suppose you want to spend more time in a museum than in anywhere else , but you are given only 20 minute to stay in the museum . how possible is it for you to stay when the bus leaf after that ? if you have the flexibility of your time , you would not have to encounter this kind of problem . second of all , travelling with a tour guide with a lot of people will more likely give le personal experience . i would like to give my experience a an example . last summer i went to a trip to the rocky mountain in british columbia canada with around 30 other people and a tour guide . we went to so many place in such a short time so that i could not remember where i went . when i wa checking the photograph that i have taken , i could not say any difference about the lake and mountain that i have went . even though i have seen only lake and mountain for the whole three day , i could not remember one of them in special , because we had spent only short amount of time on each place so that i did not have any special memory or a feeling in one site . to conclude , i would rather travel with my few close people without a tour guide than having lot of restriction while traveling . a famous poet said , ' travel to discover yourself . ' i would rather have more time for myself in one site while travelling than visiting many space without any specail memory .
