i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what already know how to do well . there are two reason . first , when high school student , i attended boxing club . in practicing , i prefered to weaker people to fight with , because it easy way to improve my technic without pain . in other word , i wa ordinary boxer and could not win at big competitons . on the other hand , one of our club member tried to fight with stronger person than he is everytime . i think he tried new thing which is risky to become strong boxer . finally , he won a big competiton and be chosen a a japan 's representate boxer . second , the president of microsoft corporation dropped off his school and focused on a new technology . although it is challenge , if he failed , he loses good oppotunity for prestige since his university is well known for reserch and study . he invented new program and it spread out all over the wolrd nowadays and is the world richest person of this year . in conclusion , at least these two successful person challenged new style and found their style . it derives from taking risk somehow , so i regard that people who achieve something have tendency of challenging new thing and taking risk .
