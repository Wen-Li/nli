i agree with this statement . i do n't like alone . when i go to travel , i want to go together with my sister . and at that time , i want to use a tour guide . because , i do n't like reserch about visite place before i go to travel . in my opinion , a group led tour is confortable for me . i can make friend in the group . i can talk a lot people . when i go to travel , i want to have new experience . to talk with member of group is good experience . sometime happen we live same city . after travel we will meet together nearby my house . another reason is i need help someone . i am usually lost way . if i go to travel alone , i will be lost way . i wo n't come back hotel . i really agreey with this statement . a group led by a tour guide give me dream that .
