i disagree with this statement . i think it is much more important to learn fact that actually illustrate an idea , than to understand concept and idea . indeed , the latter are abstract and thus , more difficult to memorize . on the other hand , a fact talk from itself . once for example , in marketing we are taught a lot of theory which are said to make a product more attractive , or to make a firm more succesfull ; we have to learn these theory by heart which is difficult for a lot of student , a they do n't have the opportunity to actually test this idea . fatcs would actually help them to understand each and every step of the theory , and understand why there ha to be a theory by practicing . this way of learning is what student of work-study program experienced . they are taugh a lot of example about the theory they are about to learn , and they have to practice what they are learning , and to learn what they practice . for instance , they will spend two week at shool , during which they will analyse several example on a selected topic , and learn the theory . the next step will be two week at workduring which they will have the chance to try , experience , and test what they have been taught . and this process happens every month . this method make it more easier for the student because they have the opportunity to put their knowledge in practice . and if they do n't understand a point during class , they will have the opportunity to get to understand it during their practice week , and to ask proffessionals about the question . learning fact should be the first step in the learning-process , followed by the theory step , and then , by the put-in-practice step .
