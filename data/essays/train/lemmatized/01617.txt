i wo n't agree with the statement given that `` it is better to have knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' specialization in one particular subject will keep a person with whole knowledge of the subject and he will be able clear any number of doubt on that particular subject . he will eventually become professionalised in that particular subject . there is also a proverb that `` practice make man perfect '' . if a person is specialised and got propfessionalised in his own subject then eventually he will be recognised in the society for his knowledge and efficient work in that subject . as he got the recognition about the knowledge and efficient work he got in a particular subject he will be able to get more chance from many company or from researching center to develop his carrer . and the door of success will get opened wider for his career to develop further . when come to the person having knowledge with many academic subject , he will have le accuracy about the subject he really familiar with . the one truth every one know that `` rolling stone gather no mass '' will describe how foolish to think to be get familiarised of many subject at a time . in this way he will be partially professional in all the subject he known and loos many important gain in life . from all the inference given above one could say that specialization in one particular subject will be better when compared with the knowledge of many academic subject .
