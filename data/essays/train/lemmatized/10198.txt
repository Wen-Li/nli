there 's a truth that some advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , but there are still some of them are the same a they really are . it 's difficult to directly say that whether most of the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in my opinion , there are only a few people make advertisement seem much better than the advertisement really are nowadays , and also in the future . advertisements are used for introducting the stuff what are expected to sell , so if the advertisement maker show people some real advertisement . there will be many people who are glad to buy . there wo n't be a problem that if people have known the thing well , because after they have spent their money once , thet will believe these advertisement , and maybe some of people will regard them a their favourate , whatever which kind of advertisement they are . for example , food , tool or electrical equipment . they 'll be sold well , and the seller will get a lot of money in the future because their honest in the advertisement . so it 's good to make advertisement a real a they are . we have to believe that nowadays there are also some seller who make advertisement much better than they really are . at first , a lot of people do n't know the advertisement a lot , so maybe the seller can increse the prise and earn a lot of money in the beginning . later , after everyone ha known the truth of the advertisement , how can the seller get money continue ? they can not ! all in all , i think that not most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
