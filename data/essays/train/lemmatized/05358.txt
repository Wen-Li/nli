young people are the creaters of the upcoming future world . these day the time is runing fast , so the people have to run with the time to compeate with the compitative world . so to do that , the young people these day are busy in there work . woking day and night to compeate with others . that doe n't mean that they are not helping their community a a part of social wellfare . whenever they get atime they are doing service like helping out old people , i totally disagree with the above statment because of the following resons , firstly now a day people are not finding any time to spend time with there parent , espacially old people , so it would be our responsibility to look after them when ever we get time . it could feach them happiness that they requare in that age . secondly many people are sufferring from lack of blood when they met with an accident that come under road , fire accident , etc . . or when a major operation is done to any pacient there would be nessasary of lot of blood at that time . it would be a problem if the same group of blood is not found at that time . to over come this problem recently there is one website oppened called `` support2friends . com '' . in this website people should register online prour by giving there detail of where they stay ( place & blood group ) . and people reefer to the required blood group to the desied area when they require it . this site could be very helpfull to the people when are in need . thirdly young people are also coming forward to donaate there eye to other people after they expire . this could be the rebirth to the people who are born blind or for the people who lost there eye in any accident . above all , i conclude that the young people are much ahead af there duty instead of haveing busy time with there job .
