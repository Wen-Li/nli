i strongly agree with the speker , yes it is more important for student to understand the main idea and concept than it is for them to lean fact . if the student understands the main idea and concept he can think brodly , and widely . it may lead to research orientation . leaning the fact is not that much important . leaning doe not improves the thinking . understaning the concept is important , why because in the case of scientist archemedies , one day hedipped into tub to take his bath , some water poured out he got an idea for formula . in this case he is having an concept , for that he is storming his barin , so he got an idea . that lead to invent the great formula . now a day we all are following that formula . so understading the concept give thye basic idea . everybody lean the fact from childhood onwords , it does't require any thinking , or invention . in this world even bird get new idea to protect them self . by seeing newspaper , telivision , redio , interacting with medium one can learn fact . it not that much great , everybody can do trhis . but for the student to understand the subject is important , because to invent , or introduce new comodity or formula , or any thing to the market or to the world . so idea maes an invention , but not the learning fact . by understanding the concept only one can reach to their higher position . now a day great country are ruiling the world in many are like . because they got new idea us if people or not unaderstanding the idea and concept at present we may not be here , these much development may not happend to our world . .
