i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . my opinion is based upon the following reason : first , the number of the oppotuinities to contact the community ha been decreasing because of the development of internet or other erectiric device or the increase of hard-working life style . nowadays , we will finish almost all business without facing any person of our community . for example . in my childhood . security for criminal wa regarded a one of the most important role of a commnity . however , recently , the security ha been thought of a one of the most significant facility of a house or an apartment themselves . i believe most japanese people depend on the security facility rather than their communites . second , young people tend to seek for more interesting or stimulaous life . except for a few arban area , i believe most young people feel boring in their life . in quest of stimlus , many young people will reject and leave their own commnities . \ third , there is the shortage of effective resorces to provide young people with the imformation on the oppotunities to be asked toward young people to take part in . so , if young people are interested in the activity in their commnities , they will not able to use such oppotunities effectivelly . fourth , there is no education on how important people are involved in their community . it is very impotant to contact with their community because such contact will bring about the discovery regarding the affair closest to u and make our life more enjoyable . in additon , a i stated belore and ha been intensively discussed . the relationship between young people and their commnunities are essential to precause criminal affair or other dangerous thing . for these reason , i agree the above statement .
