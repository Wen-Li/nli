i feel reasonable that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . for example , if we need to get information for trip , how can we make a plan . we looking for good hotel , best view place , famous sightseeing spot , good local reastaurant , and how to get there etc . .. we needtour guide can give u all of the information we need . they are specialist for getting information about sight seeing . it is very easy to get a lot of information for u . of courase the plan made by specialist never wasted time for trip . second , the most of travel tour make a group for same purpose . this is very important thing for good trip memory . we can get friend with just join tour guide . the friend who is made in trip can always make you happy rather than alone trip . in addition , group tour promise lower price anywhere than visiting alone . because specialist got group discount of ticket , food , hotel anywhere . third , the trip with tour guide is safety . there are a lot of traveler who injured , geting sick and trouble . the most of the reason is a lack of knowledge of local rule , place and manner . sometimes so hard to understand the behavior of local people especialy related religion custom . tour guide job is safety trip . they always notice safe way and information for our safety . they never take you to get possibility of dengerous . thus we should understand how easy to get good safety trip with resonable price . we should know the trip without tourguide is waste money and time .
