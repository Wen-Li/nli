in my opinion it is right that not all but a lot of advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . it often happens that you see a product for example in a television ad or in a newspaper and that you are disappointed when you have finally bought it . sometimes the advertisement promise more than the product can fulfil . some year ago , in germany for example there have been a lot of advertisement campains for cigarette-brands like `` marlboro '' . the advertisement agency tried to create an image of coolness and an easy lifestyle by using cowboy smoking cigarette a presentors of this image . but everybody know that smoking tobacco doe n't help to get an easier lifestyle . it cause disease like cancer . therefore there are governmental restriction that secure the customer from being betrayed by company . as a consequence television spot of the cigarette industry are forbidden in europe . it depends on the industry how much exaggeration of the quality of a product is possible . in the car industry for example where a lot of competition exists it is almost impossible to lie about a product . selling car ha a lot to do with trust to the people who sell the car . when a customer feel betrayed he wo n't return to buy another car . the fact to try to make sure that a product seems better than it really is is just natural . you ca n't criticize advertisement agency when they try to create a very positive image of the product of their customer because that 's just what they are supposed to do . but sometimes it happens that some people just do n't understand the message of a advertising campaign because sometimes they are too creative and the advertising agency are misunderstood by the customer . but in my opinion this `` creative '' advertisement should only be allowed to the point when it doe n't mean betraying or liing to a customer .
