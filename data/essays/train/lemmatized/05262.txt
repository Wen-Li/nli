i love to travel . .. and in my opinion travelling by yourself and by making your own plan one can enjoy better than travelling in a group led by the guide . there are several advantage of doing so . .. first one can plan there trip for how many day they want to depending on the time they have available . second they can decide how much time they want to spend in each of the place . they can skip place they are interested to visit similarly they can spend more time in place of interest . moreover if i am travelling by car i can enjoy the road side beauty of nature , i can stop and spend some time at the place i find attractive on my way . there is noone to rush me . .. or my trip is not dependent on others . certainly , if i want to leave a place in just few minute i can even do that . on the contrary , if you take a tour led by a guide i cant be my bos . .. i have to follow the tour schedule . which would be very difficult for me a i am a very independent person .
