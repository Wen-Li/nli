many people believe that young people nowadays do n't give enought time to helping their community , other people , instead , say that the young people are nearest than the old people , at the their community problem . on the one hand , the younge people have most problem nowadays . in fact , in this year the world is change , because there so many criminal and the city aren-t safety a twenty year ago . i 'm a young boy , and i can see with my eye the change of my city . for the young people is not easy to live in this jungle . .. secondly the young people nowadays than twenty year ago , going at school and at university and the time are so little . . in fact , i 'm a student and when i come back to the university i haven-t many time to dedicate for my hobby . .. or other job . the new young people spend most of the daily time at school !! on the other hand , is true the fact that more young people , often , when come back home , play at videogames or speack between other boy and girl , with internet . .. instead can use this time for help their community . but this new generation , is the generation of internet and is more difficult to teach the importance of the community . to sum up , the young people have few time to dedicate at their hobby , but when they have a free time , their use this precious hour for videogames , internet . .. and other hobby . in my opinion , i 'm a student and i attend at university of milan , i have very few time . .. but at the week end , when i return to my house , i think at my community . at sunday i organize with my friend , the game for the child of my town , and i 'm happy because i see the smile on the face of these child . is in these moment that i can say that i have do somethings of good .
