this statement can not be used for general line . it is better to have a specialization in one specific subject if it involves your work . an airline pilot or a doctor can not just have an idea on how their work is supposed to be . they must exactly know how to contact the control tower or how to execute a lombar injection . a teacher that can not resolve a student 's doubt can never be an effective one . all people should have a complete and exausting knowledge on the specific subject or job they depend on . shurely if this doe not happen , people will be damaged by it . on the other hand , to have a general culture is usefull in everyday 's life . knowing basic thing on politics and political candidate will make you able to exercise one of man 's biggest freedom : the rigth to vote . simple math knowledge will help you in filling out tax declaration paper . a high school biology course clear every doubt that egyptians , greeks and romans hav n't been able to explain in age ; people with a broad knowledge are advantaged in understanding and communicating with the rest of the world . just like every other thing knowledge ha to be a combination , a balance between specific and broad . specific knowledge help you in your work and the people that benefit from it . general knowledge is a unestimable luxury that most people give for granted very often .
