yes i do . in my opinion i thing that the best way to travel is alone , not in goup , i 'll tell why . first if you era in a travel group you heve tod follow the guide and the rest of the group , that indicate so you do n't have the time to enjoy the thing that like you , the picture are faster , quickly and other thing that happen usually . a travel group led by a guide tour could be not exited , becouse all the information is short and in mant case are incorrec . you supossed taht the guide know everything , buy in some case or some place do n't have the education or not are prepared . i am not saying that all is bad , it have ome point on it side , you can ask , and always you will find a perfect anwer . if i travel alone i can enjoy every thing that interes me. personally i am an architec , i like watch carfully the enviroment , like building , plaza , street , house and nature , and for those reason i thing i cant enjoy a group tour . on the other hand is more interesting if you construc your kwonlegemet because it will for ever , you can get imidiatly reference of place or building , and one important part i cant take picture like i want . i prefer take my time and not make any plan of the thing that i going to . thats not the sense of a travel. a travel is to get relax , drink some coffe in a little coffe shop , walk through the city , visit some historical place , visit museum and why not meet people . finally i wish i cant tavel by arond the word aolne and have many picture and many history to teel you when i came back .
