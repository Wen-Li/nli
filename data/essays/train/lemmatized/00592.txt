this is a very interesting question because it represents the current challenge in french education . indeed , the task of education is to teach student a lot of theory , idea and concept . that 's also why we learn philosophie in school , to learn to doubt , to think and analize . the follow quotation of montaigne show the real question : `` it is better to have a well established brain that a full brain . '' but both ca n't work separately : we need comon knowledge to learn how to take a decision and how to behave in society . history show u the way to behave with other country , mathematic show u how to deal with other country , geography teach u how to reach other country and language allow u to speak in other country . the comon knowledge represents all idea , concept and theory we need to make the right decision and understand our environement . despite all of this , one day , student have to use their knowledge in a practical field to experience the profit of it . the increasing rate of internship demonstrates this need of ` fact ' . education requires always more from student without teaching them the real work they are attending for . that 's why , there are more and more private school that offer a practical schooling with a long period of internship . university realized this problem few year ago and tried to adapt themself to the reality of the market . to conclude , i would say that this is a central question in education field . in my point of view both are a important . the question is no longer to know if we should teach idea and concept but more to know where is the border between idea , concept and practical fact ?
