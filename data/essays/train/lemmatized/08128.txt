well in my opinion having broader knowledge in many academic subject will be better than having monarchy in one subject . man learns basically to earn his living . in this fast generation what subject get boomed at what time can not be expected . so if u learn a particular subject when it is in boom sometimes it also happens that while the time you learn the subject it loos it importance . quoting an example java wa famous few year back but now the boom of sap ha come , in the same way knowledge of computer hard ware wa not learnt by many but now people attend special class to learn computer hardware . the growing competition is demanding them to learn hardware along with software . another example which implies to my opinion is a person who is learning dance . it would be difficult to him to just dance without any minimal knowledge of music . his learning will be incomplete . in the same way the basic acense of learning is to gain complete knowledge . having knowledge of one subject can not fullfill the requirement of complete knowledge . even though a person is called `` jack of all trade '' when he or she try to gain knowledge in many subject the fast growing world which is hungry for many more new invention to come is demanding him to be `` the jack of all trade '' . with such talent only one can survive this world of highly competitive nature . also when we learn different subject a person can relate them and this can help him at the time when he get interested in research or this knowledge itself can drive him to relate and make new invention . having one subject can also make u feel bored . having knowldge in one subject will be like eating bread only for the entire life . this sound difficult ! hence i conclude that having knowledge in all subject would be a better choice than to get specalization in one subject .
