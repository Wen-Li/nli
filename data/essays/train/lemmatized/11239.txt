i agree that student should understand idea and concept than learning the fact alone . with out understanding of an idea or concept , the application of a fact doesnt happen . if you just learn the fact , you may memorise it but do not know where to exactly apply it . practical application requires understanding of a concept . for example if a child simply learns the fact that `` telling lie is bad '' with out understanding the importance associated with the statement , it may end up in dilemma in many situation . on the other hand if the child is explained and given proper idea or concept of what happens when you tell lie , using real life simple example , it may confidently avoid telling lie and adhere to habit of speaking truth . also you can take an instance of a student who memorised the whole theory but unable to demonstrate a practical technique because of lack of understanding of the concept . so understanding the concept or idea is required to know it importance and to enable them to apply it in practical situation . furthermore , learning a fact is better if you understand it in a right way . in other word , if you understand the concept or idea involved , learning a fact is simple . it can be illustrated with an example of child learning fractions in mathematics . if child simply memorises that 1/2 is greater than 1/4 , it may get confused while taking test . but if you make the child understand the concept using a cookie by dividing one cookie into 4 part and explaining that each part represents a fraction . so the three part are more than two which inturn is more than one part . so child can understand that 1/3 is greater than 1/2 which is in turn more than 1/4 and be confident solving fraction on exam . also understanding a fact or concept promotes deeper understanding . for eg a child who memorised the fact may not be able to answer if a question about a topic which he/she memorised is asked in a different way . but one who know it 's application or understood the concept answer without hesitation . learning only promotes short term memory , which is susceptible for getting lost . but the idea and concept we understand enter the longterm memory and henceforth sustain forever . moreover while doing thing , the concept of which is understood , we can act spontaneously . in short developing concept or understanding idea about thing will make learning more easy , permanent and logical . henceforth student should develop understanding of a fact before learning them .
