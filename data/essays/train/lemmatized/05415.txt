i do n't agree with the idea that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . we watch tv , listen to the radio , or watch internet everyday and while we watch tv program , listen to radio program , or watch internet website , we often see or hear numerous different commercial that explains about numeours kind of product that the company want to sell to u . although some advertisement are really exaggertaed and give false information , i think most advertisement provide u with correct information . the advertisement we often see during the commercial break on tv is the car advertisement . when it come to a car advertisemt , it show u the outside and the inside look of the car and provides u with the engine information , safety information or warranty information . there is no way for the car company to exaggerate or lie about their car . because for example , if they lie about their car 's safety , they can easily get sued or prosecuted by the government . there are also electronic wheel chair commercial too . the commercial tell u that teh electronic chair is safe , useful for elderly people and also ha warranty . now , is there any way for the company to exaggerate or give flase information about the wheel chair . absolutely , no . commericials of the comapnies that sell mechanical product are mostly not exagerrerated and therefore , consumer can rely on them . also about pill for headache . those pill just work fine and they are not exaggereated . if they do n't work , the comapny would not be able to sell their product in the first place because the government check their product before they sell . therefore , i do n't think that most comercials make product seem much better than they really are .
