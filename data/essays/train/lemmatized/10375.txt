the statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' contains a lot of aspect which can be analysed . first of all , i do not agree fully with the statement given . these are some prediction of what may happen in the future with our everyday transport : in twenty year ' time technology will have advanced importantly . nowadays , the population in becoming aware of the earth 's environmental problem . a great amount of the society recycles , and doe not waste energy . many scientist are investigating new way to save energy . and car and transport in general are one of the most polluting producer . is there a non polluting substitute for them ? today , many investigator are looking for an alternative to car that will not destroy the earth . there are already some car that work with petrol substitute , but they are not very popular . if we found a way to preserve the environment without not using our car , there would not be fewer car in the future , but safetier for the planet . some example of non polluting transport are becoming popular in many part of the world , like bycicles . many people , mostly person who live alone or without child , take their bycicles to go to work or the city . but this alternative can not be accepted by everybody a there not everyone life alone or in the city . in my opinion , the only way the number of car will decrease in the future is with new technological invention . maybe in twenty year time we will all travel around by private plane , or by flying skate . .. who know ? it all depends on our future inventor and their imagination to create an easier and le polluting way to travel .
