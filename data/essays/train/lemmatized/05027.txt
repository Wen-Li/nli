the point at issue is to discus wheather or not it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specefic subject . so the question is , if it is preferable to have a broad common knowledge in order to be prepared for a wide variety of issue or to have special knowledge in a certain field . i disagree with that statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than of one specific subject . i disagree , because i think it is essential to figure out where someone is especially talented and then to support this quality . i think it is important to focus on a specefic subject and the knowledge which is connected to it . most people have some common knowledge about several topic but only a few have a deeper understanding of a broad spectrum . as i mentioned in the beginning i think it is better to focus on a specific subject and try to improve in this area . people are talented and advanced in different field of life and so it is important to improve where one is good at , rather than trying to develop skill that someone else might have by nature . for example , when someone is very skilled in mathmatics i might be good for him to specialize this object , rather to try to improve in a field that differs completely . in conclusion i would say , that it is good to have broad knowledege in general , but for academic reason i think it is important to be aware of specific deep understanding in one subject .
