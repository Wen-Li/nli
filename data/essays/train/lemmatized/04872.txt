in general , people prefer to do or participate in something that they already masterise , but taking the opportunnity to start something new can be more relevant . that 's what i am going to discus in the first part . currently studying at a university in paris specialized in information technologies and electronics , i agree that it can be very enriching to take the opportunnity in starting something you never did . i got this policy for a long time since i entered in this university . i always try to be aware of the news technology related in computer science and , then to start using it . for instance , i am working on big project for one month now . this project can be summarize by creating a software used by agricultor in order to help them to organise their productivity . thought i use the java langage of programmation , i take the initiative to learn by myself a new language called ajax . i never learned it before but i think that it could increase the number of the fonctions for the software . thus , i rather take a risk in learning this language because i do n't have a lot of time to learn and use it correctly . moreover , a a student in fourth year , i do n't have a lot of time for other extra scholar activity . even if i know that working for a company at the same time of studying will be difficult i do it . for instance , the next month , i will develop the new website for a company and develop another one for an organisation . i accepted to work on these project in order to make of course some money to pay my scholarship but also to learn new thing . everytime i take the opportunity to enter in a new project and participating very well i always learn more . no only on the technical field a programming but also on the human interactivity a communicaton for example . in conclusion , i approve ti statement and use to encourage my friend in doing itm even i know that i might probably help them .
