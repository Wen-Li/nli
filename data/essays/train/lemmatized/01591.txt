learning ideas for understanding facts when student first start a course , they want to know what the methodology of the class is goin to be . students are interested in knowing the curriculum and the course description . once they know all of these detail , the teacher help them reach the proposed goal . every course a student attends , expose him/her to learn fact and to understand idea and concept . however , for student is more important understanding idea and concept than learning a certain fact . nowadays , there is an approach to teaching pedagogy called learning for understanding . this approach , consists in acquiring knowledge through internalizing idea and concept . in other word , the learning for understanding approach , stand that once a student is able to understand a concept or and idea , he will easily learn the fact that support it . although this approach is not directly exposed to the student , they unconsciously prefer to learn fact by understanding the concept and idea on which it is founded . a student , find it more interesting to discus , to explore or simply to inquire on a theme . therefore , once they have a reason to research , they start to inquire . in this way , student are able to learn from detail , conjecture , opinion , concept and idea to be capable to reach the fact that support the investigation . this is a kind of inductive method to acquire knowledge . it can be boring for a student to start with theoretical fact just to discover new idea , because the student will be first exposed to a list of theoretical concept that may demotivate his learning process . on the contrary , if the student is guided to an inquiry , he will be interested in questioning , exploring , debating and understanding fact . finally , the process of learning should capture a student ' attention with any kind of motivation , and what really motivates student is to understand idea and concept rather than learn a list of fact . and this conclusion ha to become a fact to keep in mind because this new approach can encourage teacher to change their pedagogic as .
