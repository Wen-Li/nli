i agree with the idea that young people thesedays are reluctant to spend their time on participating community activity . there are two reason for this : distance from their home town and lack of information . first , young people tend to live in urban area apart from their original community for the purpose of pursuing their study or work . since more reputed university or job providing higher income are usually available only in city , young people are more likely to choose to live in urban area rather than to stay with their parent at rural area . i am the case actually . i have been lived separately from my parent since i entered university which locates far from my home town at the age of 19 . since i have lived far away from my village , i could not manage to go back so frequently , and a a result , i have not been able to join any community activity since then . thus , the physical distance from their community make young people impossible to spend their time on supporting their community . secondly , young people feel that it is le necessary to support their community because of the lack of information on present situation . this is closely related to the first point which i mentioned above . since they are living apart from their community , they scarcely have an opportunity to communicate with their neighbour and to know the present situation of their community . because of the lack of communication , youth can not realize what kind of help their community really need . therefore , young people become le concerned about problem happened in their community . in conclusion , young people currently tends not to use their time to assist their community , since they are living isolated from their community and there are rare chance for young people to know the actual situation in their community .
