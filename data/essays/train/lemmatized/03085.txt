i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . as we all know , that innovation is one of the key factor that lead to the growth of economy of a particular nation . similarly , for a person to be successful he ha to come up with something creative , a new concept , a new idea that will generate him wealth and and hence growth in life . another thing is that it a human tendency to go for a change , try something new , something different , and a rightly said , `` variety is the spice of life '' . for example , back in old day , woman in india did not work and most of them were house wife , with all the time they have with them to cook the food using traditonal gas . but , when woman in india started working they didnt have enough time to cook . somebody thought of introducing a concept of microwave , an instant cooking machine , and it wa a hit conept . same is with the introduction of washing machine than washing the clothes with hand . with this human tendency in mind , definitely a entrepenuer should take full advantage of it and he will be successful . but , at the same time it very important for a person to know whats the new thing he is going to try . he can not just come up with the idea which may not be liked by the people or or may not be a hit in a particular market . he should really do a good study of the market he is targetting , otherwise the risk is not worth it . to sum up , in order for the person to be successful it a good idea to try new thing and take risk , but the risk should be a well evaluated risk , with all the factor considered properly .
