wether it is better to have a broad or a specific knowledge depends esentialy of the point of view : if you are looking at the society general interest or at the individual interest . eficiency is one of the main argument in favor of knowledge specialization , because it is certainly harder to master a great variety of topic than to focus on a narrow topic . specialization is one of the main reason of the great achievement of modern science . today 's scientist are capable of very complex theory and project because they are all very specialized . a botanist would not mix with quantic , because he would loose some time in getting the basis , whwn he could have developed a little further a study on a peculiar animal behaviour . so for science and more widely for the human race specialization is better . but a human being and individual we need equilibrium which is achieved only throught a wider horizon of knowledge . if your goal is self fulfillement then you will be better of knowing a large panel of topic . that is why during our elementary and most of our secondary study we are studying a large panel of field in order to get a solid background on which people can build their mind . and it is valable even in the scientific world , when some of the most extrordinary discovery have been made throught interdisciplinar study . like mixing ordinary chemistry with biology you discover the extraordinary possibility of using one to dicover more of the other . you can dicover some intresting molecule in some animal or plant and you can better understand how the brain work if you know chemistry . i will end this essay by saying that a solid background of knowledge is necessary , and only then you can specialize in your own field .
