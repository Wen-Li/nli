i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are many reason that justify this fact . most young people are robust and full of energy and this give them an advantage over old people . enjoying life mean that one can be able to do all that he or she feel like doing at any time without any restriction for example taking part in a sporting activity , travelling , spending time with friend . most of these activity require one to be physically fit . young people do not have the same responsibility a old people do so this will give them more chance of enjoying life for example old people have to be careful how they spend their money because they have a number of thing to pay for ; electricity bill , morgage , their child 's education ... but young people who still live with their parent have no bill to pay so whatever money they earn is directed in paying for fun trip , fancy mobile phone and the like . another factor that justifies the above statement is that young people are more outgoing than old people do . for example young people are very willing to take part in new adventure that old people wont be very much at ease to do for example skating or parachute jumping or even motorbike racing . olp people will consider such activity a dangerous whereas young people will see these activity a a big thrill . companies that produce musical gadget like walkman , compact disc player , mp3s consider the young people a their biggest customer so they model these gadget in a way that only young people can use them easily and thus such technonological advancement dont favour old people making young people enjoy life more than old people . lastly , young people enjoy life more than old people when it come to health issue . young people are very resistant to abrupt change in weather and their immune sysytem is stronger than that of old people . for example young people can comfortably play in the cold without having any problem but old people cant .
