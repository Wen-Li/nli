i definitely agree with this statement . merely learning fact without a real uderstanding of it true meaning is of no use in my opinion . one can have all the knowledge in the world but at the same time can be incapable of putting it to any use . what use is all that knowlege if it ca n't bring about any favourable result ! to support by absolute agreement with this statement i am going to tell u about an experience of mine that taught me about the relevance of having a complete understanding a to just knowing the term . when i wa in the 7th grade my parent migrated to the u.s. from india . till then i had only been exposed to the indian way of education . out here in india we were taught that the only thing that mattered when it came to academic , wa how much of text have we been able to mug up . it did not matter whether we actually understood it . the only thing that counted wa whether we were able to reproduce it while being tested for it . inevitably , all the data that wa memorised wa instantly forgotten on the completion of the test . initially when i started studying in the u.s. , the indian method of education worked a a hindrance in being able to adapt to the american style of learning . in america education meant leaning the understanding of idea and concept . with the right understanding one would be capable of accessing information related to a particular topic . a simple action of accessing innformation posed itself a a huge task for me . as i had been used to only reproducing without having any understanding of thing , i wa completely handicapped and did n't know where to begin from . it wa this lesson that taught me the necessity of comprehending thing over mere memorising . one is better of comprehending le matter a compared to having a whole lot of fact stacked up , which one is incapable of putting to use . do n't get me wrong here . i do not mean to condemn my country 's method of education . what i 'm trying to say here is that , my country should cultivate this statement of `` it is important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact '' into it academic .
