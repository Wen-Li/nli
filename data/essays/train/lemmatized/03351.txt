there is no best way to travel . both in group and individually travelling enlightens . nonetheless , i personally prefer by far the individual travel experience . my prime argument for this conviction come from personal experience . as a frequent traveller , i love to discover . the challenge of exploring pathes no traveller ha walked , inspires my discovery . contrary to travelling in group no tour guide will be able to decide where to go or when to leave . this exalting freedom is essential to enrich the travel experience . secondly , though the security of a group travelling through well-known ground is appealing , the level of discovery is enhanced by reaching remote area . once out in more distant region , security becomes le a concern . while few foreigner travel to these region , curiosity from the local population is more widespread than criminal behavior . i would even believe that a travelling group would attract more attention of a criminal than an individual wanderer . of course , many will state that without a good tour guide you might miss out some essential sightseeing location of a visited area . this lack of knowledge of the region , however , can easily be compensated by hiring an individual guide for short trip or by relying on the excellent insight of guide book such a ` the lonely planet ' . last but not least , i strongly recommend to travel indivudually because it enables true contact with local population . as a group under the leadership of a tour guide , you will probably meet with the population used to communicate with tourist . shopowners , the family of the tour guide , ... will not give you the genuine impression of the country you visit . a narrow perspective from a tourist-minded population will be the result . as an individual traveller the chance exist that a true relationship between indivuduals can emerge . as an example i recall the conversation with the farmer with whom i shared lunch during his break in the ricefields of indonesia . he elaboratly explained me his life and his misery . this is an unique experience impossible to accomplish in a tour guide travel experience . in conclusion , although tour guide do an excellent job securing and informing their guest , individual travelling ha my predelection . the discovery of remote area and the enlightment of personal encounter have inspired my frequent travel .
