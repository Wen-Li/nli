i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , a in the future carreere working on concept is needed . only knowing some fact of a special theorie doe not help to resolve a probleme , for example ! example : in my interneship at the company lavazza i receveid a task , namely to resolve a problem in the marketing departure . therefore i did need special fact about the problem topic , but the fact were not required from the company . i had the possibility to look the fact up in the internet if i needed them . but the important point wa to know how it is the best way to form the concept and how to develope the suitable idea of this problem . the companz required these factor : 1. understanding the problem task 2. working on the problem task 3. finding solution for the problem task moreover i think that fact are the base for working on special topic or better an advantage for working on a topic . one should learn fact , but the most important point for student is to learn to understand special idea and concept in order to use them in the future . otherwise , only knowing the fact , without knowing how to work with them , is not helpful for future task . sure , there will be people who would be impressed , when they hear that you know various fact about o topic by heart , but only fact will not fulfill the requirement of a company one work in . as a resume it can be said , that fact are basically important to learn , but not a much important a understanding idea and concept , a it is not enough only knowning fact without having the capabality to work with them , for example to make a concept . the combination of learning fact and on the same time understanding the idea or the concept would be perfect !
