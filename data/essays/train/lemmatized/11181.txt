the issue at hand is that most advertisement make product seem better than tey really are . this issue is important when it come to choosing a product . in my opinion a lot of advertisement make product seem a lot better than they are . i believe this because advertising a product is n't usually about how good they are and what quality it brings with it.a product need to be sold and that 's why company need to advertise in a positive way about it in order to sell the product . for example take a detergent to wash clothes with . this product get compared with other dertergents , and usually the company who want to sell this specific product tell the consumer how much better it ist compared to it competition . the consumer might believe it and buy it , but the he find out that it doesn ' work a well how it wa promised . another reason i believe that advertisemnt doesn ' always tell the truth about it 's product is that there are a lot of competidors out there who might produce the same product . every producer want his product beeing sold the most . in order to to that the costomer need to hear a few great thing about it . on the other hand advertisement can be helpful in archievng a specific goal . for example you are in the music buisness and want your work published , it is necessary to advertise your product in order to reach the public . someone can do this through flyer , happening event of the band and so on . this example show that advertisement need to tell the correct ambitions. , otherwise the consumer wo n't believe in this product and wo n't buy it in the end . in conclusion , most advertisement though use ooverexaurration on order to get a product sold .
