i disagree with the statement , `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . the first reason why i disagree with the statement is that i know young people who spend time in helping their community . in my university , there are activity that involve helping the community . for example , there is a marathon coming up this month , and some of my classmate will help organize this event . it involves interacting with the community , and it should be a great help for the community . the second reason why i disagree with the statment is that young people do not have enough time to spend on their community . if they go to school or college , they have to spend time on their study , so even if they have the will to spend time helping their community , they can not do so because they just do not have the time . i think that it is enough for young people to help when they can , and that it should not be something that they are forced to do . i am busy most of the time studying , and it is hard for me to participate in event just because i do not have enough time . a third reason why i disagree with this statement is because i do n't think there is enough information sent to young people about event that are happenening in their community . if they do not have the information , they can not help , even if they have the will to do so . i know that if i look hard for information , i should be able to find way in helping my community , but it is not easy to find this kind of information . in conclusion , i think that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their community . there are people who are actively involved in activity in their community , and if they have the time and information , i think many people will be willing to help . i think the most important thing to do is to inform young people about event happening in their community . i think that accusing young people for not helping is wrong , and that there is a need for an environment that make young people want to participate in helping their community .
