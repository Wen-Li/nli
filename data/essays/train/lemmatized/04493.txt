young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community . the reason why i said that is obvious . because nowday we see yong people are interested or we can say beasy with other selly thing rather than helping their community with thing can be usefull to them or to others in the future . they spent most of their time in front of the tv watching some movie or watching a video clip for some stupid singer , if not then you can see them lestinning to the music all day long or playing video game with their friend like they never want to grow up . by any chance if they get fed up with all these stuff , they continue their day by playing some kind of a game football or basketball or volly ball or any other game they figure . after they finish with all these game and eventually they want to behave like adult or grown up people , they go and date thier girlfriend and take them to fancy restaurant . during the weekend they go swimmming or climbing or shopping or to do some other thing . what i dont understand why dont try to make some time to help their community . as i always say build your community if you want to build your self . i think we should encorage young people to serve the community by putting some plan to create the love of their community inside them .
