i do not agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' i think that older people have a many way to enjoy life a young people do . even though young people and older people have different way to have fun , i am positive that everyone in society ha many opportunity to enjoy her/his life . first , many young people enjoy playing sport , playing musical instrument , hanging out with friend . for example , i am a high school student , and i feel really happy when i play the piano , when i play tennis with my friend , and also when i go to movie or bowling with my friend . i see other high school student having fun playing soccer , videogames , talking with friend . there are many other way to enjoy their life too . second , i have seen on television many older people playing game , having good time with their grandchild , reading many book , etc . they can find the way to see happiness in their life . my grandmother like sowing , and she told me when i wa little that she liked sowing but also liked people 's happy face when she gave them something she made also i have seen old people playing golf , or meeting with old friend from their high school or college . however , it is true that younger people would have more opportunity to enjoy many thing because of youth . older people would have le energy or have lost some ability to do something than younger people do . but even though older people may have le opportunity to enjoy life by playing sport or something that need much energy , they of course can have something they can do without moving a lot or using much energy . there are also many thing younger people can not do because of le experience . for example , a i mentioned above , meeting up with old friend is a thing only old people can do . again , i think older people have many way to enjoy life a well a young people do . the way may be different , but everyone ha many opportunity to have fun in life , because i think that is what most people live for . everyone ha something he/she can see happiness in to live long .
