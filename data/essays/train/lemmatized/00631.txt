every people would like to be succesful in order to reach their aim which would differ person to person in term of the place of domicile , education , like and disilkes . the desire to be succesful make people find out different way to reach their goal that some prefer taking risk and trying to find out what kind of thing would be prefferable in order to make more money , taking different kind of self improvement course or self conciousness course . on the other hand some prefer to do the thing they have a know-how and try to make them better in this thing which they beleive they will reach their goal . business life is a hard place to stay stable and to be successful constantly because there are plenty of criterion to get into a job and qualification which the employee seek for , for instance ; the ability to be a good negotiator , being socially and verbaly strong annd dynamic . some people have soe of these qualification that they try hard to take a good educaton and some have personal skill from birth and some take course in order to improve themselve . risk is an important character in business life that you may get the return of it or you may loose everything . some people like risk and enters in to new way in oder to be successful on the other hand some people are risk averse and do not take many risk in order not to go bankrupt , for instance . i disagree that `` successful people try new thing and take risk '' because i think it depends on the character of the person liking risk or being a risk averse . i beleive that if a person do not like risk and ha a know-how about something and beleives that he/she can be better in this field by working a lot and searching new strategy or taking lesson about that topic . working and trying hard for a task which a person doe best and deepening about that topic would be beneficial for this person to be successful .
