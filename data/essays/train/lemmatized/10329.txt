in today 's world the younger generation is seen a careless and and lazy . often we hear parent talking about how they do n't understand the life their child live and how they do not have any ideology they strongly believe in , like the one they had in the sixty wich were all about respect and help . as a young person i believe that i have some prospective on the situation nowadays . it is true that in the past year young people were more interested in music and their friend , especially in the ninetees where music became more angry with group like nirvana and metallica that had very negative image to show their audience . this violent reaction wa in part due to the fact that the image they had of past generation wa not great . for example the hippie period in wich most of their parent lived in wa long gone and all their ideal had been abandonned , therefore `` peace and love '' wa n't a reference any more because it had been a failure , so they had to find a new way of expressing themselves and tried the complete opposite . however today more and more teenager are feeling responsible for the world they live in . they are now aware that they have a responsability towards the future and take more time to consider the possibility offered to them . of course some are still unconsiderate and uninterested but others are making change . we see a lot more humanitarian organisation runned by young adult , for example in my school there are three project that involve fundraising and the education of others on the issue of the world like poverty and global environment and all of them were founded and are runned by student . this show teenager help improve their surroundings and community because they become more respectful and involved . it is therefore a mistaken idea to think that the younger generation is becoming worse every day . it ha over the year experienced different way to portray itself and these changements have been essential for the future generation because it will give them an idea about the risk of going to the extreme and resulting from that will be a more balanced and helpful group of young people .
