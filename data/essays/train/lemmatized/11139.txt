some people think that the successful people have to only doing well in what they already know . it is really important to do well in well-known part . however , in my opinion , successful people try new thing and take risk . first , trying new thing improve their ability . as they try continuously , they faced various problem , it would raise their ability to overcome the hardship . for example , there are my friend who have really different characteristic . one of my friend always try to speak with foreigner in english whether it is correct or not . he did his effort to improve his english skill , he can speak english fluently . however , another my friend did not any effort to improve his english skill . he did n't study english except learned from school curriculum . so he hate english , and never attach to it anymore . second , experiencing risk is also helpful . it can make people more strong and development their ability when they face to difficulty . for example , in my case , i wa poor at physical work . as i worked in military , i experienced various risk such a using gun . when i wa soldier , i had to keep my country , so i always practiced the using gun . it required really high concentration on using . a simple mistake could be a big accident . so i always did my best when i controlled the gun , it raised me up to get more self-confidence . people have their own thought about the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . some people might say that successful poeple have to do well in own part indtead of trying new thing and risk . however , for these reason , i think the challenging attitude enables them to improve their ability and get more self-confidence .
