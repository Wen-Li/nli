the issue of advertisement is topical . i mean that currently you are alwais in relation with some kind of advertisement like in tv or in newspaper or on the internet and it is dificult not to take it in count and after not to compare the quality of the product with what you though it will be . from mi point of view , i agree with that statement for several reason . first , one of mi reason is one of mi experience . one day i bought a chimical liquid in order to clean mi kitchen and i wa really desapointed of the result moreover the price wa expensive for the result i had in comparison with what they show on tv . second , if i wa a bussiness man i think mi goal woud be to get the more profit that i can . thus , i will buy poor material and then manufacture it , sell it , and use advertisement to show why mi product is better than an other one . so i will just emphasize all the quality . from mi opinion , it is a common way to make business , and advertisement is business . third , i am convinced that some advertisement lie about their product just for it exists some association to defend customer right against . if you do not appreciate the service or the product you bought you can go in their type of association and charge in court the company of the product . i remenber a person that charged in court a company for lie on the product and he won . to summarize my opinion not every advertisement make product seem better but a lot had done and do now .
