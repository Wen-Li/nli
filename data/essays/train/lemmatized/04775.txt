to understand the idea and concept and be able to utilize them is more important for student . once the idea and concept are clear to the student , they can easily relate those idea or concept to their own life experience . i agree with the statement because this is how i learn in the high school . a good example can be seemed while my physics teacher is teaching u the concept of volecity and factor . in order to make u understand that volecity is composed of different factor in different direction , the teacher give an example of swimming in a river . as most of the student ha experienced or known that when there is a current in the river and the swimmer is swimming right across the river , he will not actually go straight across the river because the current is carrying him downstrean a he swim forward . this really make a lot of sense to all of u before we start learning any formula . however , if the teacher just want student to learn the fact that the swimmer will go across the river adjusent to where he set off by illustrating with a right triangle , i will probably be the first one to be confused . with the same source in my math class , this idea come to me when my teacher tell u a story of his own . my math teacher used to be a straight-a student in the high school , and he did not care much about understanding the concept of the course material . instead , he solved the problem with formula like a machine that doe not know what exactly
