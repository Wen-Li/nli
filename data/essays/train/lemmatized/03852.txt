unfortunately , it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . nowadays life ha become very complicated and exhaustive , not only for adult but also for young people . there is a lot of competition in every field . the young generation is so occupied by their own life that they hardly have any time for community service . students have to work much harder compared to our parent in order to be successful in their life . a lot of the time ha to be devoted for studying . a good education is given much more importance than earlier . secondly there are many more recreational activity nowadays . with the invention of high-tech video game , computer game like the sony playstations and x-box the level of entertainment ha reached a whole new level . then there is television and internet on which you can view an unlimited amount of thing twenty four hour a day . for sport fan there are various sort channel like espn and star sports on which a large number of sport are covered ranging form cricket to baseball . the young people spend a lot of time on the internet chating , e-mailing etc . people would rather spend time enjoying and entertaining themselves instead of helping others . the young generation is selfish and ignores the need of the community . they are more concerned about there future and do not care about the community 's future . they do not understand the importance of a good community . therefore i agree with the statement .
