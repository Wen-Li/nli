nowadays there are two many car in our city , almost all people over age us one , that mean that a lot of pollution is produce . this important quantity of polution wo n't carry any benefit for our life either for our child 's life . peolpe need to move to one place to another a lot of time during a day so they need a way of doing this movement , today car are the only solution avaliable . in my opinion we all should stop an think for some altenatives . we should think in our future morover , we should think in the future of our next generation . i think people since a little time ago people had started to realized about this issue , they had start thinking about other method of moving themselves to one place to another , however nobody is thinking about lowering the number of car in our planet but on the other hand they are thinking about the idea of building nonpollution car . so the possibility of reducing the number of car is nowadays too far away unless a new way of traveling could be develop . in addition not many people is interested in lowering the production of car . the car industry is one of the most powerfull industry all over the world , it produce a lot of profit to the main country and too the powerfull people involve . above all , in twenty year there wo n't be fewer car in use than there are today . anyone is interesting in lowering the number of car furthermore a new way of traveling is not easy to be develop in such a short period of time , however we need to consider seriously the option of building better and cleaner tipes of car . that will contribute in reducing the pollution a the same time it give benefit to the people that have interest on it .
