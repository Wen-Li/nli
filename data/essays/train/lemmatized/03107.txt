some people argue a if it wa a general truth that there would be fewer car in use than there are today , so there wa no need for me to put any emphasis on what the disadvantage of car were . but to the frank , i did not agree with the title statement . there were numorous reason why i held no confidence on them , and i would explore only a few primary one here . the first reason for my choice could be obviously seen that the price of the car had been more and more cheaper in recent year . because many car company reduced their price in order to attracting customer and got the ideal profit . and they would not care about what bad influence the car would bring about . the second reason for this problem could be involved that people had more free money to buy car with the improvement of living level of people . perhaps , a family with three person had three car for each one . moreover , in some people 's mind , the car wa a sign of social position and powerful authority . of course , i also designated that the vehicle had a couple of merit , such a convinient , save time and so on , these ware the aspect of itself that could attract people to buy it . the last fact showed that the goverment did not have the law which were relative with car and had ever never to restrict the number of vehicle . although everybody knew that the car would make pollute in our country , there were still so many people to buy car and the goverment did nothing about it by law . as far a i wa concerned , i came to the notion that i did not support that in twenty year there would be fewer car in use than there are today . i put my standpoint to believe that there are more vehicle in the furture .
