well , i disagree , because both option are important for a complete learning . imagine an education that consist only in idea . it would be incomplete , because the idea are always changing , a phenomenon that increase in a world like this , where the global communication are very efficient and we are exposed to a lot of information from a very diffents person and way of life . so , we do not have to concentrate in that type of education , base it only an idea and concept . but , in the other hand , an education base it only in fact is not good enought , because in the future , and maybe in the near future , the thing that we consider true may change , and sometimes that occurs in a radical way . for exemple , some year ago , a scientist doe not have the knowledge of the genoma , so he believe that a disease can not be cure . nowadays , the medical treatment are better , because of the study of mother cell and the genoma . the key world in this teme is change , because all the human knowledge is in risk of change . the person in the ancient world think that the world were plane , and the other planet and the sun moving around u . in accord of that , the earth wa the center of the system , but that fact change with the discover of new fact . it happens the same with the idea , they are always changing and the human race can not stop that process , because it is natural and normal . we can not imagine a a world without change , we live because the world change . we , for example , also change . when we have kid we were afraids about thing that in the present day we do not . we can laught about the fear o the past , and the way they ruled of behavior . when we are in love , for example , we can imagine the world without that person , the person we love , we do not wanna to even imagine that . but , oh , what a tragedy ! , when a relationship end , and sometimes that happens in the worst term , we can resist that person . a simililar process are involve in politics and other element of our society , in constant move and change . the human evolution is a history of contradiction and false promise and we can not be sure about a lot of thing . for all that , our education must involve fact , but also the craft for understand the change of that fact , and those craft are the concept and the idea .
