many people disagree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because they do n't like risk . however , i agree with the statement because of the following reason . frist , trying new thing give u new chance to know new thing . we sometimes find good thing after trying new thing . for example , when i worked a a salesman in a small company , i thought that job were not thing that make me to enjoy . and i thought that job were necessary to earn money to live . but i changed the thought after i changed my job . when i worked a a engineer , i could enjoy working and i could find that job gave me enjoyness a well a money . changing my job gave me the chance to know that . for the reason , i think trying new thing give u new chance to know new thing . second , trying new thing allows u to get new professionallity and new friend . for exampls , i could know not only how to sale thing but also how to make information system because i had experience to work a a salesman and a engineer . i did n't know anything about information system before i changed my job , and i did n't have any chance to meet engineer . changing my job from a salesman to a engineer allows me to know many thing about information technology and to make many friend who know many kind of information technology . and the knowledge and friend allow me to establish a company . so , i think that trying new thing allows u to get new knowledge and new friend . of course , there are some risk in trying new thing . for example , we have chance to loose our job after changing job . also , we have chance to loose my professionality because of changing job . but i think there are more advantage in trying new thing . therefore , i agree with the statement .
