in my point of view , i agree that young people enjot life more that older people do . young a the people are , they receive information more quickly than the older . thus , when they they want to enjoy their life they have more idea , more passion , and more creativity . firstly , nowadays , each time we receive a piece of new information we hold a new idea . providing that we do n't have the internet we ca n't enjoy mass medium resource . the older people are not able to enjoy them due to the limit of the knowledge of the internet . young people dive into the ocean sea for the sake of the new technology , imagining that if young people ca n't get the new idea they wo n't do that . however , the old people may not or dare not . secondly , i think young people have a strong passion for life . they dream for their future . as being in the young group , i always plan my bright future no matter what problem i encounter , thus i am getting ready for anything to happen in the next minute . i do n't think the old people are willing to accept all that is not pleasant . life is full of unperdiction and i think the best way to enjoy it is to enjoy the unknown thing happening . we are passionate enough to face the life . thirdly , life should be around with creativity . there is impossibile that a lot of thing such a romantic thing , surprising thing are supposed to happen to u without our creativity . i think the young people are more creative than the older one . if we want to enjoy the life it ca n't be emphasized any more that creativity is required . a lot of family problem is caused by le creativity . therefore , our young people should take the advantage of holding various creavitity to enjoy life . life is enjoyed with passion , creativity , and idea . young people , a the majority part of society , should do it better that the older people .
