i think to be specialised in one specific subject is good , but is not enough for your personnal development . first of all , i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because it is better to improve your communication with people . i mean , if your knowledge is really broad , you will certainly be able to talk about a lot of differents subject with a lot of different people . being open minded in your knowledge lead you , most of the time , of being open minded socially . it is important to be interested in several thing , that show your ability to adapt yourself to different situation , and i do believe that being able to adapt yourself to a given situation is always a good point ; whatever you actually want to do in life . furthermore , the more you learn , the more you want to learn ( and need to learn actually ) . the wilingness to learn can be found if you are specializing in one specific subject , but a single subject may lead you to isolate youself in technical consideration that non one can actually understand , whereas plurality of subject make your mind breath . it is no longer a question of ` academic '' knowledge , it is a question of curiosity . according to me , acknowlegment go the same way a it go for food , that is to say if you eat the same food everyday , you will just be quickly disgusted . therefore , if you just study one single subject , even if you go deeply through it , you will be disgusted one day somewhat . to summarize , i rekon it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because you can thus talk about more thing , and it make you so much curious a if you were majoring in one specific subject . i agree to say that learning about a specific subject is a good think , because everything can not be superficial in your life , but if you have only that in your life , that not enough to make this one fun
