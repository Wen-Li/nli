although some successful people prefer doing what they already know how to do well , i prefer to try new thing and take risiks . because , trying new thing and risk break the monotony , give name and fame , and also give soul satisfaction and offer new thing and technology to the society . first , life is short , so trying new thing and taking risk break monotony . for instance , doing same thing in whole life make man to feel bore and lack of enthusiasm . i always prefer to do new thing to get some interest . probing dvelves the new thing those are useful to the society . i think success come from trying new thing . second , man should get name and fame by trying new thing and taking risk . for instance , computer technology providing so many benefit to the society , this is because of people trying new thing in thier life . previously people did not use cell phone , but this technology making life easier and happier to the people . so trying new thing will help the society . third , one can get soul satisfaction for inventing and discovering new thing for society , and these give permanent happiness and one can forget his pain when he tread long path . for instance , we still memorise few scientist name ( thomas alva edison ) , they tried new thing and gave few benefit to the socity . in summary , successful people try new thing and take risk help the socity , break monotony , and name and fame . by doing adventure people get satisfaction and happiness .
