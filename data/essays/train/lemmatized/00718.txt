i have grown up with the expression `` boys be ambitious ! '' . i have heard it from my parent and from my teacher who always put the emphasis on studying hard to lead our nation . this is probably limited to korean social situation but this make student focus on just their study not on helping the community or else . first of all , student in their teen which mostly consist of middle and high school student do not and can not ( due to the limited time frame ) pay much attention to the community . lack of information precipitate the problem further . if they were informed about how life is going at other side of the world , they would have cared a little more . but there are parent who always say to their child there is only one thing they have to care about , that 's study and get to the prestigious university . even when i wa a high school student i did n't know what wa coming and going in my town area . even when i became an adult i did n't know how to participate in the community affair . these all come from the dearth of attention and care . second , unlike the system of the untied sates , we here in korea do n't have any specified rule or encouragement to make youth participate in the work of community . for example , student in the united sates actively take part in the affair outside of the school for the persuit of getting hands-on experience before they actually embark on landing on job themselves . this is faciliated by the whole atmospehere of the school student , the reason lie in the system of selecting student on the basis of egagement of social activity or voluntary work . however , we in korea can not see any benefit or incentive coming from being involved in affair outside of their school carriculum . third , the atittude and the atmosphere that the student have learned through their school year which amount to a total of 10 year or 14 year if you include university education provides the basis for the rest of their life and people still keep their old habit . it is fairly impossible for people to join the community suddenly and help the community get going . even i myself who never joined the commuity activity before do n't know how to get the information and where to look for the area that might need help or even where to start even if i seriously want to engage in a community work . in conclusion , lack of time through their school year and lack of incentive by the their targeted university and lastly ongoing habit of not being involved in a social affair prevent young people of modern time from actively taking part in the community service . starting from now , it might be helpful to encourage those young blood to care more about the community they are living in and make it a better place .
