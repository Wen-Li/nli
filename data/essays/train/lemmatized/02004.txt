`` a specialist is a person who know more and more about le and le '' . i remember coming across this statement when considering whether i should go for doctoral study and then dropping my plan . i decided i wanted to be a generalist rather than a specialist . i believe that it is more important to have a broad knowledge of many subject rather than specialize in just one subject . there are many reason why i think so . let me discus them one by one . the purpose of education is not just to learn about specific topic , but to learn the process of learning . let me take technology a an example to illustrate my point . technology change so swiftly that what we learn in college soon becomes outdated . so , how doe knowing everything about one particular technology benefit a person ? instead , student should concentrate on learning a breadth of technology so that they can quickly adapt tp new technology . broad knowledge of a number of subject also broadens the student ' perspective . they learn to appreciate a larger variety of thing . think about hypothetical student who never studied american history . would they be able to enjoy the comic historical reference in the movie `` forrest gump '' ? think of how child would appreciate and remember the name of planet if they knew that these were derived from roman mythology . would it not be interesting for student to know that jupiter is the the king of roman god and that is probably the reason the largest planet in the solar system is given the name ? these example might be trivial , but they indicate that broad knowledge increase the ability of student by broadening their point of view . another reason to study many different subject is that real-life situation require an inter-disciplinary approach . we need to know about a lot of thing to be able to solve real life problem . for example , for people to figure out how information technology can help in business , they need to have some understanding of both information technology and business . while it might be argued that a team approach to such problem need not require people to know more than one subject , i disagree . an interdisciplinary team will only be effective when each specialist is learning from others and in effect , becoming more and more generalist . finally , once a foundation of a broad academic experience is laid , it is understandable that some people may want to specialize . doctors often specialize in heart , brain or the bone . but each one already ha a foundation of learning about the whole body and how it function . ever saw a doctor who know only about heart attack and doe not know what body temperature imply fever ? so , in conclusion , a foundation of broad knowledge of a number of academic subject need to be laid for the reason of mastering the learning process , broadening world view and being able to solve real world interdisciplinary problem . once the foundation ha been layed , it is upto the individual to decide whether to go for more specialization in his or her field of interest .
