ours is a fast developing society and and we have varied branch of study in which we can gain specialization . the question whether it is better to have a knowledge of many academic subject or to specialize in one subject is a very debatable one and the response may vary from individual to individual . here , let u anlyze the situation .. universities to day offer many subject in which student can choose to major such a the science , math , literature and art ... each of these subject also have many applied branch . take for instance science which comprises of medical science , physical science , astronomy and so on . .. the scope of learning today is so vast that one can not hope to master completely even one subject , so the view of learning may subject seems to be completely out of question ... therefore , i strongly support the view that student should specialize in one specific subject rather that learning a lot of subject . my argument for the same go a following . as it is said that `` the quality of education should have a direct bearing on the quality of life '' , true a it is . if a student focus his energy and time on learning one subject he she can gain better expertise and thus he will be more proficient in that subject . a proficiency in any field in turn bring with it better work opportunity and a better quality of life . on the other hand if a student ha sveral subject to study and he can not devite his time to one , he will probably end up being aimless and jobless too . here some people might counter my view by saying that . if a person ha knowledge about varied subject he will be in a better situation to face the challenge of life . yes , that is one fact that is undeniable but a far a professional educatipn is concerned i strongy support the idea of majoring in one subject only . we all have plan for the future and we know what we want to be in the future , we are aware of our ability and interest so after calculating on all these factor one should choose a field that he want to specialize in instead of trying to learn all subject because it is virtually impossible for mortal to retain all that they learn in school or university . so if i want to be a computer engineer why should i be bothered about learning about the various form of music . the answer is obvious - it will be of no practical use to me . in view of the fact that i mentioned above we can safely reachthe conclusion that one should focus on specializing in one field only rather than creating an anarchic situation in your mind by trying to gain expertise in various subject .
