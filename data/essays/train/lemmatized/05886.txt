every year the cost of car and petrol increase , every year oil at disposition and space for car are reduced , traffic jam and environmental pollution are a serious problem . these fact indicate that in a near future the world will run out of oil or it will be very expensive and unaffordable to buy oil and car , road are always more and more crowded and make it difficult to travel , the pollution is getting worse and worse . this is why in my opinion in twenty year from now there will be le car in use that there are today . if the world is not willing to change today 's mentality and care more for our environment and our health , we will soon live the consequence . for example polluted air will cause health problem , witch by the way it is already happening , or we wo n't have anymore fossile energy at disposition for more important use than transport . today our society is not aware of the consequeces our pollution is causing on the environment and for example the ozone . when it is understood that what we are doing is wrong then the restrinctions will start , for instance forbidding car on sunday or making it more expensive to drive because of the eccessive tax on gas .
