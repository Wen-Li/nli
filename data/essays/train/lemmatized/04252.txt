i completely and loudly disagree with the statement - `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one subject '' . agreeing to it sound like one is agreeing to `` it is better to have one foot on one boat and the other on another than both foot one a single boat '' . the given statement reminds me of a famous aesop 's tale in which a young boy learns , unfortunately after his death , that if he had dug a well instead of digging several pothole , he would had not died of thirst . specializing in one specific subject is like climbing a ladder while trying to get knowledge of many academic subjets is like trying to hold many branch of a very broad and high tree . it is obvious which one is more fruitfull , which one is easier , which one is wiser and which one is better . it is better to be a full artist than a quarter mathematician , a quarter chemist , a quarter biologist and a quarter physist . the world remembers name of newton , einsten , shakespeare because they specialised in their field , not because of their part-time job or knowledge . in today 's world of sheer competition it is not important for a student to have gained many bachelor 's degree in many field but to have a specialization in one particular field , if he want to secure a good job and future . one should always remenber that it is better to be master of a single trade .
