knowledge is made of two basic component : the fact , that we can describe a the empirical evidence that our sens , or machine , provide u about reality ; and the ability we have to extract actual information out of this unordered data , which we may refer to a `` idea '' or better , a interpretation . any useful knowledge stock must be made of this two component strongly integrated . but even if both of the component are foundamental , they have n't the same level of usufullness : while fact can be looked up in book or any other reliable source , a strong conceptual foundation on a subject , which allows for rapid and effective extraction of information , can not be built overnight . specifically in technic and scientific subject , it 's utterly stupid to try to learn by memory the huge amount of formula , number , rule of thumb necessary for example in engineering . it is far better to build up the technic and practical skill required in such a field and then go back to the detail whenever they are needed , and if possible memorize them over time and exercise , so that they will be stuck in our memory for year once mastered , instead that for day or week . our memory can be easily paralleled with an archive : an empty archive with a rational structure and the right label already in place can be filled in no time , an archive which is full of paper but where organizational mayhem reign , is going to be almost useless , or require an excessive effort to get anything valuable out of it . thus student should value carefully every side of the subject they 're studing , but put a stronger effort on building a conceptual foundation that will allow them to effectively exploit what they have learned trough the year : they should nonetheless be very careful to `` fill the archive '' to have something to exploit in future year !
