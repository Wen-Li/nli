i strongly agree that `` young people enjoy life more than than older people do '' for whole lot of reason . first of all people at young age are not bothered about any responsibility . they are free bird and they like to enjoy their life to fullest . for example right now i an doing my graduation and i am not at all bothered about anything , i enjoy a lot with my friend , go for party , have get togethers , we watch lot of movie . i never think about future , i like to take the life a it come . whereas when i see my parent they are lot more concerned about different issue in life , like they are bothered about their life after retirement , or the burden of their kid . the next thing is people at young age try to be adventerous , innovative in their thought and idea . they try out some thing or the other to keep their life intresting . they expect some kind of thrill in their life . whereas the elder people doesnot want to try out new thing and they prefer to spend a stable and peaceful life . people at young age are very healthy compared to the elder people . they are with full vigor . the health problem of elderly may keep them away from enjoying the life to the fullest . like for example most of the elderly people may have problem with blood pressure or may have cardiac problem or may have arthritis or any kind of problem . so these people generally tend to keep their life in subtle way and try to avoid all the noise or try to live in peace and serenity . finally the elder people may not be knowing the latest innovation because of which they may be deprived of enjoyment . like for example my grandparent doesnot know how to use the computer and they are not intrested to know . so the enjoyment which i get while browsing the internet and knowing whole lot of thing , which made my life easier can be defenitely compared to what my grandparent are missing . so for all these reason i strongly believe that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .
