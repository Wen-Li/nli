i do agree with the statement that it is very much important for the student to understand the idea and concept rather than to learn fact . let 's take a common example of a student listening to a science lecture . it 's very much important for him to understand what is dealt about before forming an opinion on the topic . if the lecturer just put the fact infront and ask him to byheart them it wud be of no use . the student might forget those fact after sometime a that do not create a strong impression in mind . but rather if he understands the idea and the concept behind the topic there is a higher chance he can remember that for a longer time . another important aspect is that just learning the fact would not lead to the development of the subject . it 's only when one get a thourough idea of the complexity involved in that , one would get an idea of how to develop the concept . for example let u take a student doing his project work on developing automobile efficiency . unless he know what are the factor involved in developing efficiency he can not succeed . it involves the student to learn the idea and concept behind the subject apart from learning the fact . in most of the case it 's proven that false understanding of a subject would lead to an irrepairable situation . and knowing the fact without probing into them always lead to a false conclusion . secondly probing into the fact and understanding them also help a student on a personal front . in one 's daly life one may come across many complex situation , which if one considers only the fact might land oneself into trouble . let 's take an example of a student getting angry on his father for not providing him more pocket money . the father would not give more money a he perhaps feel that his son is involving in illegal activity . the student should probe why his father 's not giving him the money rather that to blame
