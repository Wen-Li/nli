i agree with the statement , the best way is in a group . however , i disagree the travel is led by a tour guide . i think travel in a group ha a lot of benefit . it will be fun than travel alone . i think travel alone is so boring . if we travel in a group , we can talk when we are going somewhere . and we can enjoy the game during the trip . but if we travel alone , we ca n't play . we wil spend time quitely . when we travel , i think fun must be first . we can help each other . if someone do n't know something how to do , his or her friend can help him . if someone ca n't do something because of other one , his friend can do that instead of him . for example , there are firework at night . by the way , he is sick or ca n't go out because of his work , then his friend can bring his camera and can take the photo and video for him . i told you that led by a tour guide is not good . during the trip , the tour guide explain and teach everything . therefore , getting information is so easy . then we will forget the information easily . i think if i get something easily , i also can lose that easily . we need to prepare information about the place where we go before we travel . it is my experience . i prepared information before i went haha tower . and when i went haha tower , i could know about that very well . and it wa very interesting . and you can talk with your friend with that information . and you can get more information by your friend . by these reason , i think to travel in a group without a tour guide is the best way .
