succesful people can be diferent depend of the enviroment or the culture apliance . the way that people do thing or use the knowledge to do it can be a common factor in succesful peple . in my opinion successful people start to succed in the enviroment that they know well . for example , a computer expert will start his achivements working on his field , computer . but that do n't , mean that he will be successful just in his mayor . one person can succed in many aspect , like his or she personal live , spiritual live , etc . dos n't exist one rule that say to succed you need do just the thing that you know how to do , but also do n't exist a rule that say you need tray other field . in my personal opinion the kay to succed is just be free of take the risk of living . normaly starting with some field that you can work with but thinking that maybe some day other horizont will be opened in other way a unknown way . for example , a representative sale in one shoe store acchive his goal a a sle man increasing the number in fifty percent . but the owner that posse one car dealer shop offert to him other job , with better condition and benefit . the guy start a a shoe sale man but his way to sale shoe gave the idea to the owner of the shop to put him in a new job mannager of one car dealer shop . clearly shoe are no the same of car . on the other hand , sale is not the same that mannagment , but the quality is the imperor factor . in that way the quality found for the owner of the shoe store and the car dealer shop is not related to shoe or car is related to the person , the actitude , and the capacity of use his pre - knowledge to learn something new . the key of succed is just a combination of desire and knowledge . using a a spark the knowledge tha we posse and being ready to any change with the capacity to adappt own and learn new challenge i sthe key to succed . is like successful people get the achivment of their goal .
