it is a contradictory statement . first i agree because if a student learns idea and concept can take decision . with an idea or concept a student can think about us , aplications or simply example of the topic from where it came . p.e. if you think on a different equipment that you can do with something cilinder ( the idea is the cilinder ) , you get aplications of it like you can do a drum , a tunnel , etc . ideas and concept can be used to priorize different subject and to focus on a principal goal to be sucessfully , p.e. if you get different idea of an electrical problem that you have on class , like motor no running you can think about solution to solve it and be sucess like check the breaker , test the current before the motor or some others . sometimes is mixed the idea and concept get student to fact , and otherwise some fact , let student to get idea and concept . but second i have to disagree because when a student get fact and learns from it , this knowledge let undertand what happen and can change the behavior of certainly act or activity , p.e. if you know that when you laugh in class disturb the class and the teacher is not feeling good with that behavior , and you are going to get your score based on knowledge but also on certain appreciation of the teacher , you can modify it and do not laugh in so the teacher will be feel better with your presence and will be take it in consideration before put your score . so this is a contradictory statement because for student both thing are important to understand idea and concept in one hand but in the other to learn fact , and aplying all of this can get sucessfully .
