without no dubt , i totally agree that most advertiments make product seem much better than they really are . there are big two reason . first , advertiments affect u by the most attractive way . second , advertiments provide u amont of information . as a result , i think that most advertisement make product seem much better . first , advertiments attract people . most of people wathc tvs and see some advertiments between tv 's show . people see the advertiments naturaly . think about it !! . when you see new ipod 's advertiments , you had thought that that 's cool . most of peope think same way . in contrst , they just changed coloer and some shape . they did n't change these dramtically . however , some people think that i want to get it , like me . advertiments make u strong atrract . moerover , how do you choose movie when you would go to movie theater ? of coures , most of people see the advertiment and go to movie , even they never watch the movie . in my experenece , i went to movie theater to watch a movie because the advertiment wa look great movie . however , the movie wa n't good movie at all . therefore , advertisemtns make u much attract . second , it is best way for u to get new information . even though , i see new advertisement , i always think that it look great . everyday , we can see some advertiments in most of are .
