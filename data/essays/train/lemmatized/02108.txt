travelling is a good choice to spend weekend and vacation . however , one is usually faced by the decision : `` is it better to make it on my own or within a group led by a tour guide ? '' . apart from the extreme point of view that are either `` individualistic '' favoring doing everything alone , or `` extremely sociable '' favoring having everything done in a group ; i believe that the correct decision to this problem depends on the situation . to clarify what i mean by this , let me cite an example . suppose that you are planning to go to egypt or greece for instance to watch the ancient monument and museum there . this kind of travelling is known a cultural tourism . then , it may seem reasonable in such a case to travel in a group led by a tour guide . after all , being alone may prevent you from making full benefit of the trip . for example , you will not be able to know exactly what the most important histroical site are , and what their history wa . in such a case , a tour guide will provide you with a valuable experience ( let 's assume he is a knowledgeable guy ! ) . without explanation from somebody , you will most probably be unable to understand and hence appreciate the monument . but doe this imply that it is `` always '' better to travel in a group led by a tour guide ? absolutely no ! in many situation , travelling alone will provide you with a space of freedom you might need . suppose , you are going to washington d.c. to watch the significant historical site there . since the site are really diverse , ranging from musuems of science and technology to museum of modern art , it may seem unlikely that you can really enjoy it if you travel in a group . people have different taste , and what the tour guide will probably do is to divide the time evenly between all the site to cover everything so that no one will be unsatisfied . the problem a you may infer is that , this way , in fact , nobody will be satisfied , since everyone will find himself `` forced '' to go to place he almost hate , then spends only 5 minute or so in place he really like the most . so fianlly , in making the decision of travelling in a group or alone , one should consider the situation ! having an ex ante point of view might not be objective !
