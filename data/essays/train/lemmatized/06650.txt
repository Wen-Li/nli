youth can but doe n't know , elderness know but ca n't any more . that the way i would answer this question . in my mind , when you are young you can enjoy the simple fact of being alive and having the whole life in front of you . young people are unaware of the misery that go along with living . for sure , health and hope help for enjoying life , but when you do n't know yet where is real happiness , you just waste your time . older people maybe have another way of being happy and enjoying life that may not be worst : they know what they have done , and hopefully get idea of what they still can do . most of the time , older people have more material well than young one and the satisfaction of a well managed past life can keep an elder being happy , with his family , the house he built , or the society he helped to carry on . moreover , this state of thing allows them to know that they will do pas . .. so , why not to do what you have ever wanted to do ? older people know that their time is to come , and regarding this , get pride of what they done before . the reason why older people may enjoy life le than younger one come from the fact that they sometimes just live not to die , whereas young one just live to be happy . youth is for fighting , building and lust for life , elderness is for being in peace , getting benefit of what you done hardly when you had the strength to do it . or that the way it should be . in the end , i would say that it 's easier to enjoy life when you are young , but elder way of enjoying life is much more true and deep .
