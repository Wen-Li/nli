i do agree with the statement that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . this i concluded from my own personal experience , and the personal experience of my relative and friend . i have , on several occassion , actually purchased , a whole range of product , like lipstick , soap , detergent , clothes , etc , after having seen them being advertised on tv . but on most occasion , i wa not happy with the product in hand , they simply did not match the quality that they claimed in the advertisement . in a leading brand shampoo advertisement , for example , it wa claimed , that the regular use of the shampoo for a month time , would lead to the complete dissapearance of dandruff . believing this claim , i bought the shampoo for my self , and used it a advised . but the result , were very un satisfactory , after it use not only did the dandruff problem continue to persist , it had in fact much worse than what it wa before it 's use . similarly , a leading health drink brand , in it advertisement claimed that , this wa , by far the best health drink availble in the market , and it taste much better than any other brand . falling pray to their claim , i changed my brand of health drink . i purchased this , instead of the one that i had been using for a long time . to my surprise , i found almost no differece between the two brand , not only this , there wa no added health advantage i recieved form the usage of this brand , which i did not recieve from the usage of the earlier one . my relative , friend , and many of you a well will have similar experience to recount . indeed advertisement make tall claim about the product , and they have way to make their product look much better than they actually are . for example , let u talk about a leading brand energy bar advertisement . in this add they show a well built athlete , on the race track , sand claim that we can be like him we use the energy bar . but some thinking will tell u , that there is nio way of guessing how the athlete got his health . a sneak into the athleats personal life will tell u that . not the add advertisement , should not be belived , they are there to sell product , and to do that they can go to any extent to make thir product look better than those of their competitor . as a result of which most end up making tall claim about the product and make the consumer buy these . after susequent use the consumer realises the product is not a good a it wa claimed in the advert
