i agree this statement , `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i 've been going to school for 12 year . i am a high school student . i learn many thing at school . my favorite class is english class which i think is the most important subject we have to learn . in english class , we read some book and discus what the book tell u . when we discus about the book , everybody ha different opinion and it is stimulating to know what other people say and figure out what the author is trying to say . there are too many message in book for a person to understand by oneself . i think we need to discus with many people who are smarter and have different idea . the book do n't tell u fact . they tell u idea and concept . that 's why we need to get together and find those idea and concept . those idea and concept are only clear to the author who writes the book . the author try to tell other people his idea and concept by writing book , but it is impossible for him to perfectly tell them . this is the reason we keep studying idea and concept , and i think it is important for u to understand them . i think idea and concept are more important than fact . facts are like the thing we learn in physic , chemistry or math . we need to know all those fact to be investor or some scientist , but i do n't think learning fact is the main purpose of education . i always have a special feeling for being a human , because we can not only know the fact , but also creats idea and concept . other animal can not do that . i think to understand idea and concept make u more cultivated and better in many way . facts let u know what is going in the world we see , and idea and concept let u know what is going on in our mind . i think it is more important to understand idea and concept because they have deeper meaning and they will make u better people . i believe that 's we have to do throughout
