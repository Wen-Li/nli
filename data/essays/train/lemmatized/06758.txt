today , the car industry is at a decisive turn in it history . while the population in urban area keep growing , and there are more and more people that need transportation in their everyday life , the industry is facing both economic and environmental challenge : how will it take up these challenge ? will the world become a place saturated by car , and totally polluted by car gas emission ? the car industry ha enjoyed a tremendous growth since the post war period . it developped at a fast pace , and many industrialized country adopted the individual car a the answer to meet the rising need of citizen for transportation . during the last half century , car have spreaded everywhere in the world , becoming the number one way for people to move . the example of the us society is relevant to show how car is playing a major part not only from a practical point of view , but also on a symbolic level , a the first individual car were the ford t and this technological advance contributed greatly to develop the us influence all over the world . however today , regarding the economic context and the environmental situation of the planet , i think it is high time we think about what i would call the `` post car era '' . indeed , the whole car industry success lie on the fact that people have easy access to affordable fuel , a fact which is today increasingly questionned regarding the political situation in many oil-producing country . besides , today people seem to be more aware of the dramatic ecological impact car have on the environment . i often reflect upon what would next generation think of our irresponsible behaviour , because although we know it is a suicide on the long run , we keep using individual car even when it could be replaced by environment-friendly mean of transport . anyway , i am confident and i think that soon there should be major change in our daily habit regarding the use of car , which should lead to a sharp decrease of their number . but i know it will take time , and i think such goal can not be reached without a prior global reflexion on what we , a human beeings , are currently doing to the planet we live on , and on what the alternative to the massive use of individual car are . what is at stake , the future of the planet , is far too important to be overlooked .
