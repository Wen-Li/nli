as you all know many student choose to learn what it is written in their book rather to see the main idea behind it . this lead to developing generation , who wait for others to think and accept their idea a a truth without questioning it . so it is very importent for young people to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact . firstly , when you are taking a math class or any other subject related to science you have to learn the main principle of the subject in order to succeed . for example you can not just say something fall down when it is dropped . you have to know that there is an external force called gravity , which keep all subject on the ground or make them fall when they are in the air . without understanding the main reason or thinking about the cause you can not make any progress for yourself and the others . secondly , it is not only true that someone should learn the main idea for the science related subject . also in other area like history or politics ( especially in politics ) you should know the reason why something happened or going to happen . unfortunetlly many student believe that history is only about learning war or important charecters in order , but history is more than that . without the background information on the fact , for example the wwii , you will never understand why the americans have to go into europe in order to support england . in this example it is important to understand that england wa the only country against the nazi-germany and needed help in order to prevent the groth of nazi-era , but without this information it will be just another war in the human history . finally many student say that they have many think to learn and to understand the idea behind everything requires much time , but that is only a misunderstanding . especially in engineering subject , such a programming , you can not learn every single command , because there are to many of them ! the main point of programming is to know how to build an algorithm and how to translate it into the programming language needed . the rest can be done by everyone with a little experience in computer . to sum up , fact are nothing compared to the idea behind them . in order to take an important part in the society people should produce their own idea , otherwise they will be nothing more than a slave . in order to do that you need to understand the main idea .
