there are controversy about importance between having a broad knoeledge of many academic subject and a specific subjcet . as a matter of fact , i am following the opinion that having a broad knowledge is more important in modern society for two reason . let me explain more precisely . to begin with , knowing about lot of kind of fileds study may increase tha ability of communication , which is thr most impotant key in the futuer world . humana have achived a great deal of development in each erasin own filed and that cause the miscommunication to each each other becaus the concpt are now reaaly hard to under stand easily . so , word ` generalist ' and appeard instead od ` specialist ' contemporary society . by make conncetion in spacial academic fileds they colud play a team work in various project . furthermore , having a broad information can make a `` sinerge effect '' in a specific era . if the knoweldge intergated with others , the benefit are not only double but triple , even increase inormously , and this ih the reason why trem `` sinerge effect. '' maked . for that reason , many university is makig a joing coures for their reacherch a a ` inter-displinary ' purpose , and thorgh those kind of effort current stuy are gaining a great deal of accomplishment . for exem \ mple as a graduate student , i am undergiong that method too . on the whole , broad knoweldge can make more fluent social communication and make each specific subject more power by connecting . that make cleare that it 's better to choose than a specific subject learing .
