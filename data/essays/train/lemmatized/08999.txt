there will be le car than nowadays , in twenty year time ? my answer to this quetion is no . as the technology improves , there must be other transport that can replace the car , which is the most importatnt transport to people these day . people might invent something much safer , faster and more comfortable . however , i think it is just going to be an improvement . what i mean by improvement is that they change the shape , fuel that car us or even electronical and technological thing that car requires . for example , automatic car . automatic car is controlled by the computer system in the car so that driver do not have to drive him or herself . if they wish to drive then they can change it back to mannual mode . also , fuel that car needed migth be change in twenty year time . these day most of people use gas or patrol . but in the future we might use solar energy or electrcity instead of gas or patrol a it fuel . there are some car already use electricity but it need more improvement to make it perfect . futhermore , car might be able to travel above the water or under the water , not just on the road . i 've seen a bus once in liverpool that it can travel on the road and above the sea . it can be easily changable so that people can travel with their car above the water a well a on the road . to sum up , there are so many improvement can be made without inventing something new . beside , i think it is better to improve car than inventing somethin new a we are used to it .
