in my oppinion whether to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject or to specialize in one specific subject depends on the skill you already posse and the stadium of your study . my suggestion is to visit a lot of different and widespread spectrum of class in the first and second year of your study . this will definitly help you to build up a solid fundament of overall knowledge and basic skill . perhaps , when beginning your study you are not quite sure in which area or specific subject you want to specialize in the future . therefore it is helpful to get an insight into many subject in order to find out about your strength and interest . after this period of orientation , i clearly recommend you to specialize on a certain subject . until now you should have already gained a fundamental basic knowledge and a clear view of what your interest look like . so now it is time to enhance your skill in your field of interest . it is very important to gather detailed knowledge about your specific subject , because that is what will make the difference between you and someone with general knowledge . this is your advantage . for instance , if you later want to apply for a job in industry or at a research facility , it is necessary to be provided with good specific knowledge and skill . otherwise your employer may think that you might not have unique strenghts or interest and chose someone else . today it is very important to be an expert in your field of study in order to compete with others . by specializing on a certain issue you show that you are able to concentrate on one topic and that you are able to go into detail . provided with these attribute you will stand out of the mass and you are thus well prepared for future challenge .
