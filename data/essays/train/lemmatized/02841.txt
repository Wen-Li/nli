i feel that the young people enjoy there life more than the older once because the young people do n't have any responsibility . for example compare with a girl to her mother . basically a girl only ha a responsibility to study and if she ha finished doing it , she probabilly enjoys by freeking out with friend to a good place orby going to some friend house . but her mother who ha many responsibility like her daughter , and the other child she had so basically she is busy in her responsibility . she dont atleast do n't find time to enjoy . and if she is a working woman she ha to move to her job in the morning and when she return to home she need to do some work like cooking and cleaning the home . so finally she is tired at the end of the day and she dont atleast have time to enjoy and she feel to take rest . but basically enjoying also depends on the people character some people are there who really enjoy there work they feel that they enjoy by doing their work properly . and some people enjoy all the time by making fun . i feel age is not the matter to enjoy or responsibility are not the part which stop the people to enjoy . and the older people enjoy really when they completed there responsibility in a proper way the feel proud and they do enjoy there job . but enjoyment is the job what we have done in a proper way with out harming or hurting the other people , but the enjoyment should be in such a way that the person beside you should also enjoy . the young people enjoy by freeking out to party and the older people enjoy by fulfilling there responsibilites . so probabilly both the generation enjoy but in the way they enjoy is different .
