i agree to the statement proposed . in my view it is very important that one shoould undersatnd the idea and concept before they sit down to learn the fact . i would like to support this statement by giving a personal example . i am a student studying in the 12th grade . today the concept and fact that i need to learn are not very easy . definately , a lot of hard work go into learning them ! but , if i sit down and understand why and what i am doing. , then it definately make it much simpler for me to go through an entire chapter . i think this is the case with many of my friend too . i would also like to put down the fact that i am a student who ha shifted from the normal c.b.s.e an indian borad to the international baccalaureate because of one simple reason . at my earlier school the standard norm wa that of rote-learning . we would just have to mug up the entire text book and regurgirate it on our exam paper . . but my current school help u understand what we are doing . they make u do activity and give u explanantions on what we are going to do and why . this really help me and my peer to learn faster . so , i very strongly believe that what ever we do ha to have a great deal of understandingbehindit , before we jump in to learn the fact . we should always ask ourselves a set of standard question before we jump into a task or start learning fact that we dont undersatnd or we dont have the basic knowledge about . most importantly , why ? why is it that i'am doing this ? what ? what is it that i am doin ? what am i going to gain out of this ? where ? where is it going to leed me ? i think by answering these question we make a very good and learned individual . we do understand and definately , learn better !!
