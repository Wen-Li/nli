i agree with the statement saying that most advertisement make product seem much better than they actually are . indeed , advertisement are made in order to sell a product , they are not based on objectivity . in my opinion , advertisement are not a fair representation of the product they are proning . most of the time they emphasyse the good side of the product but they avoid mentionning the eventual problem that can be found when they are used . for instance , an advertsiement for a piece of clothing will insist on the aesthetical aspect or on the fact that it follows the current fashion , but it wo n't insist on the fact that the fabric may be of bad quality . furthermore , advertisement make product seem better because , when it come to clothing , the garment is advantaged by the fact that it is wore by a person who fit the aesthetic criterion of the population . when a potential byer see a piece of clothing , it is always presented to him in a way that it appears to perfectly shape the body whereas , in reality , the advertisors have certainly choosen the person who will make the garment look perfect . it probably wo n't be the case when an average person wera it . last , the people who designed the advertisement often do survey prior the release of the product . the survey are used to ask to a certain number of people , representative of the class aimed by the product , what they think about the product , what they like or dislike about the it shape . this way of funcionning unables the designer to know what are the attracting side of the product , it is easy then to highlight those aspect in the advertisement in order to attract the buyer . that is why i think that people should not trust the advertisement they run accross . most of the time it ha been designed to appeal to the customer and , when used , will prove to be much different than what one could have expected by seeing the advertisement .
