if i wa asked `` there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year '' , i would answer i do n't think so . there are two reason in my opinion . first , some people use car , while others use train and bus , but both transportation are very busy in the morning . so seeing from nowadays situation , to dicrease using car will lead to a serious problem . for example , we ca n't get on the train which we want to get on because of busy and full , we are late to be the going place because of train 's late running . therefore i do n't think there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year since if there are fewer car in use , public transportation ca n't work . second , since many people love to drive a car including me , i 'm sure that car in use will not dicrease . moreover such a people do n't like useing busy train . they prefer driving a car to using another transportation . lastly , car company sill develop car 's model , cost and now they tried to make new kind of car like economy car . so i beilieve car in use are increasing .
