in my view i say that young people enjoy life more than old people do because the young people being at the age of teenage will have have a spicy life which is more colorful and interesting , whre a the life of old will be bored . for example if we take a human life he or she will be more active and happy at the age of teenage , because that time body will be in a position to react to every response occuring . at younger age the responsibility are not known to him like the value of money , thinking the future of his child , having greed on many item , this all situation make the him unhappy and bore his life . at the younger age we dont have any desire like this just seek the desire of enjoyment . at younger age there are also problem but compared to older they are le , younger age problem are minor related to his surrounding in school and college . younger age people are free from mental tension and they are free bird . older people give all their responsibility to the younger one after he becoming a family person , so then the younger one feel happy and interesting in solving all the responsibility given . the older wont give up their feeling if younger get suffered due to some reason , they also take the parallely the responsibility of the younger . but at the same time if the older get a problem the younger may not take that much serious . in general , older people ha much love and effection on the younger but reverse it is not true . so older people take all the responsibility of the younger and give happines to them , so i conclude that younger people enyoy a lot in their life then older people . and the younger ha more colorful life than the older .
