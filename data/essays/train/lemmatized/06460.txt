i agree with the statement about having broad knowledge of many different subject is better than only one specific subject . nowadays , there are too much knowledge to learn . everyday we can get new information from the internet , book , newspaper , and tvs . first , i think every subject is important to u . some people think that only high-technology is the most important thing of our society . because of the great improve of technology we have a convient live . but it doe n't mean other subject worth nothing . good society need good policy and it relates to many many different subject like economy , history and so on . second , since we can get so much information everyday , we should tell which is right and which is wrong , which is trouth and which is fake . in order for u to tell from right to wrong we should have some basic knowledge . we should have broad basic knowledge of different kind of field . third , even when talking about high-tech we should learn knowledge from many different kind of field and combine it together . only if we combine different kind of knowledge can we turn our technique into application . many new industry combine two or even more field . bio and electronics , bio and mems , bio and nanotechnology are all the new trend in the future . when people have only one specific subject of knowledge , when talking about some specific thing , they might be an expert . on
