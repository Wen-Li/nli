with the recent rapid economic development , the pace of life is becoming faster and faster . consequently , few people nowadays think it is more vital for student to understand idea and concert . on the other hand , there still some people who think learn the fact is more important . in my point of view , whether to choose or not is not a critical matter , and personal preference should be respected . after consider my personality and the fondness . i will choose the latter one and list the reason a follow . the first arguement that can be presented to develop my idea is that learning the fact may make student understand the idea and concept more easily . both common sense and our experience have informed u that learning fact may provide a more general and clear view . a good example could give some light to this point . as the student learning fact through the real example may give them a more specific and detail of the general idea of the thing . moreover , opposite example can be found to demonstrate that student understrand the idea and concept may not know how to use them into the real life , such a the learn the theory on the class and do not know how to use it into the real experience , so there is no meaning to learn it a student do not use it . in addition , it is easily obseved in modern soceity that learning the fact my be more effective . it is obvious that student studing by learning the fact may be more effective a they can get the general idea from the fact . to illustrative this there is an example that is very persuasive . students learning through fact which may more impress them than just let them understand the concept , so they may learn it more effective and do not just learn the idea from the book , learn the fact are more interesting student to memonrise it . nevertheless , student understand idea and concept also have advantage to some extent , they can know the basic idea of the thing which may give them a direction to solve thing . however , such merit is speculative , what is more if you can see that not everyone can understand it deeply and use it . therefore , learning the fact is more important . in these circumstance , after close comparision between the learing the fact and understand idea and concept , it is not difficult to draw the conclution that it is crucial for student to learn the fact rather than understand idea and concept .
