i agree with the statement which tell that ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . ' travelling with group is fun and having a leader make it much funner , because , usually , the leader is an expert in his area . travelling with a group led by a tour leader is better because you will be able to see more place , the tour will be well organized and you will not feel lonely and you will gain more information . travelling with a leader give the treaveller a great opportunity to see all the tourism place . the leader will be specialist in that and will know the best place to go . for example , from my own experience , when i travelled first to london i knew hide park and nothing else . on the other hand , the next trip wa with my uncle and he wa our leader and guided u . he give me a chance to see the musuems , hide park - which i already have seen - , regent park and big ben . it wa amazing trip and much better than the first one . for that reason , for the taveller to be with a leader make the trip much busier and let him or her see more place . also , having a leader save the traveller more time and make his or her trip much organized . by travelling with a leader , the traveller will notice that he or she always refers to a schedule . every tour will be prepared before tavelling . the time will be accurate and the whole period of the tour will be prepared to give the traveller an opportunity ti visit a much a possible of tourism place . as a result , to travel with a leader make the trip more organized and more rememberable . when someone travel with a group which is leaded he or she will not feel lonely . he or she will be most of the time with the group dicovering new place a it is scheduled . also , another benefit is that he or she will get more information . usually , with group , which are leaded , the leader give some brief information about every new place they visit . that will let you a traveller to gain more knowledge . in conclusion , to travel with a leaded group is much better than travelling alone for some reason . first , you will get better care , more organized trip and more knoweldge . also , that doe not mean you will lose your privacy . certainly , you will have time to have a walk or go out walking .
