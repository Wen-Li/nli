the time dedicated by young people to their community is of a great importance . it show the interest of the younger generation for their family and culture background . i believe the young people do not spend enough time to helping their communties . they certainly have good reason but the reward of helping is priceless . why do young people do not spend enough time to helping their community ? i see two main reaons : professional life and new communication technics . our parent used to spend most of their careeer in one or maximum two company , in only one country . nowadays , professional life is more suprising . one can change position very quickly , depending on opportunity . positions are not fixed and young generation ha le link with the employeer than older generation had . the firm root is not a major concern for young generation . communication and travel improvement allow people to move from one country to another one quicker than ever . life is not be lived only in your home country . internet give you the opportunity to instantly travel via your computer . your community is the world , your friend are all over the world . young people will have more difficulty to follow and support their community a the community root is more difficult to identify . but young people will have to settle themselves down one day . where will be their community at that time ? where will be their home land ? this question will be very hard to answer unless you took a great care of your root and specifically of your community . that is the reason why i believe that giving some time to helping our community is priceless in regard of the reward it will then bring u . community will be what stay from an active professional life . community will be your home . you have to take good care of your home for the time you will either need it or be back in it .
