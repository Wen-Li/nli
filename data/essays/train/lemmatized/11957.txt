students are being asked to be more and more competitive , they have to learn a great amount of thing and they also have to understand what they 're learning . but , do we consider that understading is the main quality they have to get or do they have to challenge their memory for everything ? in order to answer to this question , i 'm going to think first if we can understand without learning and then i 'll evoke the importance of both learning and understanding in the study . when you 're in class listening to a lecture , you want to focus on the main idea developped by the lecturer : you want to know if , once outside , you 'll be able to explain what you 've heard to a friend . first the fact are n't the thing you want to keep in mind ; you desire to remember only the major concept and idea you have understood . but for instance , in a history class you can understand the cause of the second world war except that if you have forgotten all the date about the conflict nobody will follow you ; indeed the date help the listener to understand what ha happened and give him some hint to understand cause of the war in a global way . so it seems pretty hard for a student to understand everything if he doe n't begin with learning . consequently , a student ha to work with his memory , he must be aware that he ca n't understand the whole subject main idea if he ha n't learned a little . you can explain easily a concept to someone if you have in mind all the background that you 've learned about the subject before . for example , if you know which event ha happened when and where and if you can link it with other event then you understand thanks to what you have been taught by your teacher ! to conclude , i 'll sum up the previous point i 've discussed about : it 's obvious that you can try to understand everything you 're told without learning but you 'll have some issue to understand the whole thing , you might understand a part of it . if you complete your understanding with a serious learning then you get the opportunity to master your subject and then you become what we can call a great student .
