nowadays almost everybody can afford a car , something unimaginable a few decade ago . i ca n't now imagine a world without car . i believe the use of car will never decrease . furthermore , i 'm sure there will be more car in use each year thanks to the development and need of society . there are several reason to think so . to start with , we all know the convinience of using car , such a having more freedom or determinig one 's sozial status . i will give an example to support that they can determine a sozial status . my neighbour ha been earning for some year to buy a very expensive car . he 's not rich but he just bought this desirable car to make people think he is a very prosperous and rich person . another argument is that technology is in constant change . probably in twenty year car will have such entice thing that everybody will desire one . no matter how much expensive it may be , a lot of people will be affording all their life to get the best one . a third reason is that economy is thriving all over the world , and more people will be able to buy a car in some year . i feel that those who nowadays use other mean of transportation desire to have a car . from the argument i have stated above it can be seen that in twenty year there will be a much car a there are today , or even more . they provide u a lot of benefit such a making our life easier and exiting .
