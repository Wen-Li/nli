when i wa a student in high school in my country , south korea which country ha a lot of test in school system , i studied hard to get a good grade on my test in a short time . so , i had tutor to help my study . the tutorial wa a professional to lead her student to study efficiently . her teaching way wa to give an idea and key concept to her student . first of the half week , i wa the way far from the class that i wa n't sure about what point she want to point out . however , after few lecture with her , i really grasp the main point that contains the fact that we try to reach . with my great experience , i agree with the opinion that understaning idea and concept is more important than leaning fact for the three fact . first of all , the fact that we learn is usually ha the some `` reason '' why that fact occured . the `` reason '' is an idea and comcepts . to recall of my school day , my professor wa always teaching the student about the main key idea to approach to the main problem , the fact . this approaching way to the fact wa really helpful to think up the multi other fact . second of all , when we read a textbook , you will soon find out that it say a lot of the concept of the fact . this fact show me that the author of that textbook pocus on the concept rather than just pointing out the fact . as we generally know , the textbook author always try to help reader understanding . and the author way to writing textbook is show a many information that could give the idea and concept . third of all , in the real lecture test , the professor do not only ask about fact . professors usually ask about how the fact happened , or presented . it mean that many of professor believe that studying and understand idea and concept rather than study only fact is more effective to learn . in conclusion , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
