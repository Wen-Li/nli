i disagree with the statement , because i think , that older people enjoy their life more . the problem is the definition of the word enjoy . in my opinion is `` enjoy your life '' not , to do everything i could do in the le time a day spend . furthermore it is to select the important thing , that take you further or let you become more lucky . young people sleep only le hour and use the time to make party , do a lot of sport or hang around . that 's their definition of enjoy life . the older one have more experience in their life , because they are older and they also were young . as they were young they tested everything , too . and now , they know what kind of sport , cultural living , meeting they need to be lucky . so they can concentrate themself on the real `` funny side of life '' . i think , that young people not enjoy life more than older one do . i think , they are looking for the right answer , of what is the best thing i could do with my time . on the other hand , older people normally have more money than younger one . so they can affort expensive sport , event or other happening , which younger one will never seen in that way . and the main point of enjoying life are the family and long grown friendship ! i heard it a lot of time , that parent and grandparent said , that the greatest , the most amazing gift is a child ! and they never want to change the time they had before . and they enjoy spending time with their family or friend . that is an experience , which younger people can not understand .
