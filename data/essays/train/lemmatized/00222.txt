there are a lot of people that think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject , but in my opinion it is better to specialize in one . in my opnion , the problem with having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is that the person can not have a strong and deep knowledge of each one of them because he or she will have practically unlimited source of study , and this will derive in knowing just a few thing or very superficial fact of each subject . i realize , though that there are people that study a lot of academic subject because they are trully interested in them , and only for their pleasure , in that case i admire them for having so many different interest . in my personal case i found that specializing wa a much better thing to do . for example , i am a physician and the subject of medicine is absolutly huge , so when i finished the medicine school i decided to be a specialist in neurology . when i got into my speciality i realized again that it wa practically imposible to have a very strong knowledge about all the field of neurology , first because it is a very vast part of the medicine , and second because it is changing practically in a daily basis , and being current with all the information is a quite difficult task . thus , i decided to sub specialized in neuro-oncoly in order to be able to have a very strong and deep knowledge of the subject , even though it is a very specific one . in summary , i know that there are people that prefer to study many different subject , that could work very well for them but it doe n't work for me . i think that it is better having a strong knowledge at least in one field and not superficial knowledge in a lot of subject .
