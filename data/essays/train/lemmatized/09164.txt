i agress with the statment made here . advertisment are a tool that business use to promote a product . it is ofcourse quite obviuos then that they will only show the positive side of a product in an an attempt to get a customer to buy it . it is not in their best interest to be honest . businesses live by the fact that they are legally allowed to lie . any advertisment ha the purpose of selling . if business were truthfull about what they were selling product sale would decrease significantly . lets take for example ciggeratte advertisments . ciggerates are bad for your health . in today world you will not find anyone to argue with this statment and be able prove their oppinion . so how do you advertise for a product like ciggerates ? how do you convince people to buy something that kill them ? clearly ciggerate manufacturer have thought about this greatly and have come up with the best answer . psychology . advertisments capitilise on human psychology understanding . an honest ciggerate commercial would cause people to avoid the product . so therfore advertisers learn about human psychology and how to attract people to something they know is bad . they highlight the package that come with smoking rather than the ciggerate itself . there is'nt a ciggerate commerical out there that convinces you to buy their product because of it taste or it feel . they get you buy it by showing you the social and status reward of smoking their brand . like davidoff and it elegance . so when people see advertisments they sometimes remember only it social effect rather than the product itself . to me thats how advertisments can make a product seem better than it acutally is .
