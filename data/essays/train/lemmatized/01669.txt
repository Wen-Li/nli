i 'm not sure that in twenty yers there will be fewer car in use then there are today . probably many nation , for example china and india , will increase their number of car because today in that state not many people have a car and many person use the bike or go on their foot . but these nation now is working so much that i think that probably soon more people than now will have the money to choose and to buy a car . and we have to remember that in asia there are more than one billion of person ( only in china there are now 1 , 2 billion of abitants ) ! in europe ( expecially in the west europe ) and america ( naturally the north of america ) , instead , we are in a different situation : we have many car and the traffic in our city is very strong and dangerous for our life . many family ha two or three car and the italians spend many time in their car : all day there are much traffic in all the most important street of the country . maybe it will be better if many italians leave their car at home , so they would need of only a car for family , there would n't be the smog ( even if this would be a myracle ) and many people would be more happy . surely our nature and ambient would be more happy . but the situation of east europe is similar to china 's one ; that part of europe is poor and i think that in future that state will became richer than now , so many other people will buy a new car . so i think that this problem ha n't a solution : probably in twenty year there will be fewer car than today , but probably there wo n't . only the time will can solve this partcular and difficult problem .
