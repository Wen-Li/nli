fewer car in twenty year ? really sound a if we are asked that will we have to leave our daily necessity ? today car have become a necessity of not only a rich person but also for the one who is just earning a hand full of money . car have really made are life comfortable and easy going ? and we really ca n't think our life without them . i dont think there will be fewer car after twenty year . today the man is progressing at such a fast pace that will only lead u to developing more and more car with new technology . the technology ha made such an advancment that within month we have car with a new and incredible functioning . today we have automatic car , with superb engine and their speed is somewhat we cant even think of driving at . the new invention being made on car doe not even limit u with the fuel that we utilize in driving the car . today we have made car that run even without fuel . that either run on some gas or any other burning substance . further i believe making , buying and selling of car is a bussiness that is really flourishing today . we have so many racing car these day that are so expensive and there is no shortage of costumer who buy these car . people invests a lot in car racing game that take place round the globe . and after the race these car are put to sale . furtheron , i believe that today the economy is increasing at such a fast pace that there is no shortage of money , that people can not buy a car . even a normal financially stable familly today have two to three car . they are also a symbol of luxury for many people . with the increasing population every second the demand and supply of car are also increasing . the new invention and new facility in a car like air condition , music system car and big car like limozine which are like a home in itself , are becoming more and more comfortable and easy going . so i think that there will be more car in twenty year than they are today .
