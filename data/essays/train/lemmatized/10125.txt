i ca n't help thinking that people who take risk have to be rewarded . but there are all the same numerous limit at this judgement . first , i am convinced that when a person take risk , she must be aware of the danger of a possible failure . when that person know these danger , i feel that if she achieves what she wanted , she is rewarded for numerous endeavour she did . for instance , when a man or a woman decides to open a store or a restaurant , he or she doe not know the success of it . if this person work hard in order to improve his or her way of life , it is normal that his or her situation change positively . furthermore , ambitious people can employ other people and help the society to fight against the unemployment . in general , good thing come to those who have the ambition to change their life . however , numerous people make effort to change their life but they do n't succeed . they do n't have the success they hoped and are not rewarded . what 's more , people who do only what they already know how to do well should be successless than people who take risk , at the condition that they are aware of what they do . we must also take into account the level of risk . indeed , the success may be proportional to the rate of risk , it is tantamount to saying that people who take more risk should be more rewarded . for instance , when a man becomes a manager , he take more risk than he wa a simple employee . he earns , therefore , more money than before . i would like to conclude by saying that i agree with this statement because , a i see it , people who take risk should be rewarded . however , they must know the consequence of a failure before starting their business .
