there is a statement here about being successful . it say : successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i want to express my opinion by giving example from real life ; first , look at ataturk 's life . he attempted to save his country with his friend and at the end of the war he achieved it . indeed it wa not a new thing . there are , exactly , similar condition and success in turkish and world history . but after the war he tried to found a new country which is governed by citizen ( although this term wa new for the turkey in those day ) and try to bring democrasy culture here . after all of these , he is remembered a succesful man and a leader . in conclusion , i can say that trying new thing and taking risk can help you to be succesful . but . .. in the twentieth century businessmen found a new business strategy : frenchising . there are lot of chain of company and you just contact with them , giving them amount of money which they determined and you can be successful in this way . that is a way of success without taking risk and without finding new thing . after these instance how can i conclude ? and do i have to ask this question : what is success ? to answering these question is not easy but i want response in my way ; if you just want to be successful person who life in high standarts you do not have to take risk . but if you want to be a successful person who will be remembered untill the end of time you must take risk , you must find new solution to old problem . at the end , i just can say that i agreed the statement and i have to add that at the same time i disagreed it . i hope i profess it well .
