i disagree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . because the truth of the thing is always right way for everything . the advertisement make producets seem much better that ca n't to stand forever . first reason i think the product did n't need to seem much better thatn they really are that because when i go to the shop center to buy something , i usually need that and we will buy it . if we bring it go home and found it is n't well a we saw at the shop center . i will fell sad . and i will remember it name then i will never to buy the thing of the name again . actually the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , that mean they want to sale a lot of product . if every custom will never buy it at the second time . i think that is the obside what they want . that may make the child to learned the bad habit . second reason i think we need keep the truth of the product is because we need keep the truth for everything . when a little child came with his mum and saw the process of thing a same a the fovered . he may be learned from it and do something a same a that . he wo n't do the truth of the thing . that the trouble with the future . finally , i think if we can work hard for everything . and try to do the best . then we will not need some advertisement make product seem much better , and the product will be the best . to show the truth of the thing may be not well at that time , but it is a good way to change to the best .
