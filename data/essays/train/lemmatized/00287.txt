every day we face decision that make u do something better trying a new way . but we usually forget them and focus only on the big one decision because those can completely change our life . successful people usually are more lucky with those great decision , but i do believe that successful people are not only those who take risk , but those who can understand when take a risk trying something new , and also if their decision affect negatively other people . many situation in life could determine if a risk is worth taking , and are related to the field in wich the decision are taken and the fallout of this decision . for example a basketball coach could face the situation in wich he ha to decide to try something new and unusual to win a game , such changing the defense scheme that help him win many game in the past . in this case the risk could pay off and give him success . on the other hand if someone is a very good medical doctor , he ha many patient and ha a large family , but suddently he decides to became a professional painter that risk would only hurt his patient , leaving them without a cure , and his family , leaving them without financial support . for them he wa already successful by doing what he learned and wa trained to do . i think that one major mistake that we usually commit is to measure success with creativity . of course a person can be successful if he do something in a new way , but there can be success also in attaining excellence in a field . i do believe that the ability to take rational risk is very valuable , but otherwise it is more easy to be the better one doing something if you already are doing this particular thing .
