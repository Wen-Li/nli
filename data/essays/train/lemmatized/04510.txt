views differs greatly when it come to the discussion whether to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject or to specialize in one specific subject . on the one hand , some asserts that having a wide range of knowledge is better . while others think that it is better to specialize in one subject . however , i think it is better to have a broad range of knowledge . take engineer for example , they are very knowledgable when it come to computer related problem . but they are so isolated in their computer field that when it come to other subject they have no clue . my friend john is the perfect example for such discussion . he is an excellent student in the engineering field . he can answer any question you might have regarding computer . however , when we are talking about other subject , such a , art history , he can not join our conversation at all . another problem with focusing on just one single subject is that you will not know what else is out there . you might be interested in world history , but because you are specialized in one subject . you have to spend all your time studying that subject and have no time to study world history . one of these day , when you look back . that might be the one thing that you regret the most . nevertheless , specialize in one subject have it advantage . you will have a very clear and deep understanding of that subject . but when we compare the advantage and disadvantage of specializing in one specific subject or not , the most obvious selection is to have a broad knowledge of various of academic subject . with the point noted in the discussion , i agree with the statement . i think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
