i agree with this statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i have bought many product so far , and i am going to have to buy many product in the future . in my opinion , there are many product which are different from my image . when we watch tv , we see many advertisement , and most product we see on tv are very attractive for u . companies which make product are in competitive situation everyday . they have to make better product than other company . advertisements are very important for these company to sell all product . therefore , these company have to make attractive advertisement even though the product is explain about only good thing . this is these company ' business . i usually decide to buy product when i see the advertisement . however , when i wnet to a store and saw the product , i sometimes thought that it wa different from my image . finally , i gave up buying the product . it happens sometimes . therefore , product are not necessary same a the advertisement . when the product is not same a our image , it make u disappointed . therefore , i agree with this statement . most advertisement are made to attract people . of course , there are some product which are same a those of advertisement . in my opinion , we have to decide to buy product after we go to a store and see the product . moreover , we have to understand that it is not always same a our image .
