i agree with this statement and i also believe that it 's an unavoidable `` side effect '' of the advertising process . in principle the whole idea of advertising something is not only to convey information but also , and mainly , to convince an audience that a product is good . an advertisement is not a technical report , the main purpose of which is to state the thing a they actually are . .. in an advertisement every single aspect is carefully and strategically planned to attract the attention of an audiance and to convince it . it 's not a surprise then if in an advertisement a product look so good and when we have it in our hand it doe n't meet our expectation . i 'm not saying that advertising and cheating are the same thing ! i believe in fact that most of the people are aware of this fact , if not by intuition , by experience , so where is the cheating if the victim is aware ? and furthermore often we do n't find in an advertisement plain lie , what we see is that the weak point are not exposed in their full extent . if we watch for instance the advertisement of some phone company we almolst believe the everything come for free : well , to the best of my experince the bill arrives . always . sometimes ago i had the opportunity of designing a flyier for an event , so in a sense i could see the advertising process also from a different angle . making that event looking very good and attractive wa my goal and i did my best . now i 'm asking myself whether or not i described my `` product '' in such a way to make it look better than it actually wa . .. the answer is `` no , i 'm not a professional , but i wish i could . .. '' . i guess i 'm not in the right position to complain !
