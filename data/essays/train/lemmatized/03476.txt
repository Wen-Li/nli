i think that the main idea of this statement is successful people try a new adventure also get some risk , and they already know how to do well . i think this idea is important , because if people try to success , they should try a new thing such a a new job or a new opportunity what they never try it . that could be very hard at first time , but when the time go , we could find out our success through the new opportunity . commonly , people want to do work which is very easy or very common thing , they do n't want to look like speicial and they afraid about the risk after they do that work . however , this is the difference than common people , and successful people in our life . almost all of succesful people create something new . i think that only a few people achieve success from old idea . successful people think different way from other people about what kind of new thing will make them successful . also , they make an effort with their work . here is the example of thomas edison 's success story . thomas edison wa not really smart boy when he wa young . however , he had really creative think with everything and try to do experiment if it is possible or not . as he said , 99 % wa his failure , only 1 % wa his success . he did not afraid with the risk , keep concentrate a new experiment . i think that his creative thinking and make an effort wa the success point for him . every people want to success in their life , they want to earn money a lot , and get a authority in their own life . but , if they want to success in their life , they should think different way from other people , find something speical which is not really common thing and should be aware of some risk that they will have , but if they success with a new adventure , they can be a hero , successful person in this world .
