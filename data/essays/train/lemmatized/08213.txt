some people have the idea that the social work are bored and annoying and for this stupid idea that the young people are not encourage to spend time in this mode . the most part of social worker are voulenteers and spend the ours free time to helping other person in economics or social problem . is a good thing to do beacuse before do that we ca n't immaginate how much is important for the society this kind of job . the young people see very far away this problem , like ca n't move or ca n't reach the post office , beacuse in this life moment they see more attractive the disco or go to the pub every night . i have many friend that partecipate to a helping communites and do n't spend so much time in this like bring dinner for homeless or prepare stuff for the african problem community . luckly in the early year the idea is changed and more young people prefer to spend a little bit of their time in social work . specially before the italian governament a instuited the `` civil service '' that provide to bring them into a social circle to help the community than have few person . i dont think that all the people want to helping their community but in some case there are a experience , sometime sadly sometimes funnyest but in all the case really helpfull . the most important work in this problem is do by the television and mass medium than must bring at light this problem and encourage the young people to spend more time to help and le time to play , without compromise the career study , if they have one .
