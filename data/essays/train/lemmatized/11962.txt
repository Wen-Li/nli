there are a lot of theory on the number of car that are in use now and that would be in use in the next future . experts have different idea on this question , and their theory are based principally on the cost of car ( including the fuel , the insurance , etc . ) and of government ' policy . in my opinion , if thing do not change quickly , in the next twenty year in italy there would be fewer car in use than today . my first argument is that car ' cost is increased year by year in the last time . even if car ' price are not increased , the cost of the fuel and of insuraces is now at an incredibly high level . for example , the last government 's law , in order to solve the financial problem of our country , contains a special tax on suvs . today , a tipical italian family can difficulty afford the cost of a car . in addition , the local policy of the city are other reason for not buy a car . now in all the big city there are traffic limitation , and , in order to try to reduce pollution , in some day car are not allowed to move in the city . furthermore , old car can not circulate at any time during the day . also , in the city is very difficult to find a parking and , when one find it , it cost a lot of money . therefore people prefers to go to the city with scooter , that take le space , or with public transport , which are cheaper . however , the italian government is not giving a real alternative to the car for people that need to move for work or for other reason . the public transport do not cover all people 's necessity . for instance , there are no bus during the night so , if one want to go out at nightime , he or she ha to use a private mean . in conclusion , because most family can not afford a car , and because car are not useful if one can not use them ( like it happens with city ' limitation ) , i think that the number of car will decrease in the next twenty year . however , government policy is not helping to resolve the situation in favour of public transport .
