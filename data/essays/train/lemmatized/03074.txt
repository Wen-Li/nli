from my point of view it is more important for the student to learn the fact and then start learning the idea and the concept . student must know the fact before he learns the idea and concept . because without the fact he cant easily understand concept and he cant even memorize the idea which he would have been learnt . so the fact are very important before we learn annything . the basic concept will be learned from the fact and the idea can be easily learnt . for example if we want to learn about gravitational law we would first think about the newtonslaw . but the fact is that he founde out the gravitational pull by the apple falling from the tree on to his head . . and thus by this we can easily understand the idea and the concept . these fact will be easily leraned by the student and they can reproduce them very effectively . they wont even forget the idea and the concept with taht fact . thus by these fact we can easily learn the topic very easily and effectively . another example for undesrtanding the idea and the concept is that if we want to know how light wa evolved there are many theory and the major fact is that light wa discovered by thomas edision after his 99th failure thus by this we can easily capture our mind related to the fact so that which can be easily stayed in our mind . thus i strongly disaagree the above point it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . so student must be first learn the fact relating to what they are studying . these fact are easily available and thus they should learn them first and they must keeep them in mind . these fact will surely help the student to increase tgheir memorizing skill and their intrest to the subject .
