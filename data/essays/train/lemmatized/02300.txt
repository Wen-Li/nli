i agree that in twenty year , the number of car in use shall go down . at first glance , this might appear absurd and strange , what with the rapid technological , social and economic growth everyday . however , on carefully analyzing and thinking about it , this claim actually make sense . i shall try to elucidate on why i feel that there will be fewer car after twenty year . the population of this world is increasing day by day . public place are often jam packed . traffic jam , accident and so on are the order of the day . if this is the situation now , one can imagine the state of affair after twenty year if thing continue like this . think of any big city and unfortunately the first picture that come to mind is of heavy traffic , lot of people and no space . because of the rapid development and technological advancement , one often say that ` the world ha become smaller ' . this statement sound highly appealing in a figurative sense . but after all , the world is physically of a fixed size too ! if the number of people and their car keep on going up , where will all of them be accomodated ? be it small car or big car , the pollution level are at an all time high . the fume from these car result in lung related disease and breathing problem . when the number of car wa small , these issue were often brushed under the carpet . however , now is the time to think of these thing . at an age when we are facing the consequence of our action , be it in term of global warming or war , people need to realize that we should look for alternative before it get too late . community vehicle , car pooling , even bicycling ( for short distance ) often result in much le tension and effort in moving about today . with more efficient bus , metro and train , people have started to realize that driving around in a car is becoming more of a nuisance than a convenience . there is also a growing concern about the limited petroleum resource in this world . the petrol , diesel and oil price keep shooting up day by day . we need to find alternate mode of travel using renewable source of energy like solar or wind . people are researching on solar car or wind driven car . with the scale of progress today , the open sky might also turn out to be a very viable option . if we can introduce cheaper air travel even between shorter distance , this will not only result in much faster travel but shall also help ` decongest ' the earth . unfortunately today , people have become so lazy that even for short distance they prefer to drive rather than walk or cycle down . but people need to realize that this phenomenal growth in car can not go on indefinately . people need to look for alternative . i am hopeful that in twenty year , we would have shifted our focus from car to public transport , non-petroleum based vehicle and perhaps even air travel .
