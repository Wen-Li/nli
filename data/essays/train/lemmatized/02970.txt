i agree or desagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , depending on the size of the group . i desagree if the group is so big . i had the opportunity to travel with a big group to a country that nobody knew before . it wa a very bad experience because the tour guide wa in trouble because he wa responsible for everybody and during the traveling some got lost . some wanted to spend more time looking at other thing and some wanted to take picture and got lost , etc . so , i do n't recommend traveling with big group . instead , i agree that the best way to travel is in a small group led by a tour guide if it is considered the following : first , the group ha not to have more than ten people . in this way , the group can be well managed according to the cirscunstances . for example , you can easily rent a van to visit some other place that are not in the itinerary or you can plan a party during the night . second , the people that are traveling together need to have almost the same age in order to have fun . it is not easy when you are traveling with old people that you can hurt with a simple noise or with anything that they do n't like . and third , do n't let the tour guide to take all the control over the itinerary because they can be like a father carrying little child . i have been seeing tour guide that do n't give any flexibility to the group . being in other country and other culture the group want to experiment the new environment , especially at night if they want to have a party , and not having someone to tell yor `` time to go to bed '' .
