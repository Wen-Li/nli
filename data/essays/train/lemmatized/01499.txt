now a day , the medium is flooded with advertisement . from medicnes to sport , form food to car , the medium comunicates to the world new and sophisticated product every day . however , many of these new product seem to be idealistic and fantastic to be true , thus questionning it reliabilty . for example a medical drink for fat people that doe not involve diet or doing sport . i belive that modern advertisement is in fact the new type of propaganda , the medium is flooding our mind with half truth and half lie at the same time . the new machine for indoors sport are a typical example of this . new machine that are suppose to work magnificiently over a small period of time , are not only expenseive , but also inneficient . on the other hand , the poor reliability of adverstisement wa imposed by ourselves . the consumerism society we live in is constantly demanding for perfection , so that is why adverstisment tend to alter or bend the truth to some extend . for example , if i see an advertisment about a restaurant , it is not enough for me to see the quality of the food they sell a their product , but it is more interesting if they tell me about the quality of their product , like how good their meat is , or how tastefull the bread is . therefore , this need of flare in comunication way ha created , for me , a different idea of the product offered in a certain piece of adversitsement . although this may be true , occasionally some piece of advertisement are really reflecting the true image of the product they are selling . for example , machine and technology to make our daily life easier , like new blender machine or washer , trully performe to the level the advertisemtent say it doe . however , for oneself , it may no be the case but the reason for this is that the machine is misused or it purpose misunderstood . in conclusion , i believe advertisement sometimes exagerrates product , but also , sometimes it is u that can not use them appropiately . therefore i belive that although advertisement do make product better , we must also be carefull on how we judge these advertisement an if we truly understand how the product work or to waht end .
