it is a common saying that older people do n't have so much fun in life than younger people . or that you have to use the time when you are young , because the old age come very fast and then there is nothing left in life that you can enjoy . therefore , it is a very controverse topic to be discussed if young people enjoy life more than older people do . i disagree with this statement , because there are many reason that show the difference . there is a saying telling that you are always a young a you feel . i think that is perfectly right . my mother who is 52 year old doe n't behave like she is over 50 which is a very old age for young people . she wear modern clothes like my sister and i and she listens to the same music . she doe what she want to do and enjoys life a much a possible . another point is that you ca n't say to an old maybe also handicapped person that he or she doe n't enjoy life . a friend of my grandmother is about 76 year old and despite her leg injury she enjoys life and ha a very positive attitude . an example of how she enjoys life are her various trip with a group of older people . twice a year this group travelles to place in europe by bus . they do n't go hiking anymore , but they visit museum or famous building . in addition to that , they are together with many people at the same age and with the same interest . everytime this woman come home from one of those trip she is really happy , because she ha enjoyed it so much that she want to go on the next trip again . concluding i can say that by regarding various older people i 'm sure that older people enjoy life a much a young people do . the only difference is that the activity and event which make people enjoy life might differ between young and old .
