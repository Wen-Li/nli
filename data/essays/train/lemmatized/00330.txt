i can not fully agree with saying this statement is true nor false . i think that there are a lot of successful people with different opinion about the business they do . for example am i imagining a man who made billion of euro trough selling shoe . i can not see the point why this man should stop producing and selling shoe for something else , something he is not experienced in . why should he risk his money and business trough trying something completly new ? on the other hand he maybe just should spend his money in something new . being a successful salesman did not just teach him how to sell shoe but how economy in general work . he could use that knowledge to build up a completly new business . the better he can handle his money , the more risk he can take . i think it greatly depends in which category or area someone who is successful take risk . if i would be rich trough selling shoe , i would not mind producing a completly new kind of shoe no one ha yet . because i would be used to the economy and the business , i would not be so afraid to take this step , even if there is the danger i would not earn any money for my new creation . on the other hand i would not spend any money or risk in some business i have got no clue about . for instance am i , a shoe-producer , not used to anything about food-business . the danger i could lose my money trough investing in food would extremly be increased , compared with the rate of losing my money with remaining selling shoe . what i am trying to say is , that there is , in my opinion , no general answer for this statement . i can not fully agree or disagree with it .
