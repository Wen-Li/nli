i firmly agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . in my country , it is the biggest problem that young people do not want to volunteer their community . they just give their time to study or get a good job . my country ha a programm that give some point to teenager who help their community . at first , it wa successful because every young adult attended this programm . however , after 1990 , education programm wa changed so student did not want to join community activity at all . so it change a duty of student . soon , it changed the hatest programm to young adult . they attend community ' programm just for get a point , not in serious . according to this situation , i can feel that nowadays ' young people do not want to help their village . also , all community in my country are helped by adult . if young people who live in my town want to join the town club to help their community , they will depressed because club president will not admit them . my communitiy ha strange custom that club member 's age have to over than 30-year-old . it is unfair to young people but adult still keep this custom . it make teenager to do not have attention to their community . in addition , there are several research support an important reason that young people did not attention to their community . accoridng the famous scientist team in my country asserts that nowadays ' young people are shy and not out-goint than 30 year ago , so they do not show their opinion to others . because of young people 's personality , community are helped by only adult . although there are country that totally different from my country . however , country which are located in eastern world have similarity of this trend . therefore , i claim that young people do not give enough time to helping their society .
