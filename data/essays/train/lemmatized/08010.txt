i agree with this statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' this why we can see so many company invast their money in the commerical every year . first , it is fame . maybe one company 's product is good , but if there is just few people know it . the product will fail , because it is not famous . of course , the product will not sell well . instead , if today this product is pretty famous , it is easier to sell . for example , i am also play the customer role in my life . i used to buy one famous brand of milk . and i quietly to buy other unfamous brand of milk . if the survey asked me `` why you always buy this brand of milk ? '' i will answer , because of it is fame , i believe the famous brand is better than others . '' however , do i really do the reserch about the milk ? and prove it real better than other brand . of course not . second , even the most advertisement enlarge the real funtion of product . but most people still believe that , and they will try to buy it . because they want make their life better . for instance , the energy drink , there are many people drink this kind of beverage . they believe this drink brings them energy and power . somehow , some people even think they can not live without it . is it really have so wonderful effect on the body ? i do n't agree with it . i think the purchasing is result from the advertisement . it make people believed what they saw . to sum up , i strongly agree with this satement . because i am also the customer in my life . through the advertisement , they meke me to trust their funtion better than they really are in the life .
