although i do believe , that lot of people still invest energy and time for their community , i tend to agree with the statement . as a matter of fact , even i do not invest time in working voluntarily for the well-being of others around me and when i reflect about the activity of my friend and family , i see no difference to me . to understand why , one should see the bigger picture . in time people more and more suffer from economic pressure , in time they have to focus on two , or even three job to bring home money for their family member , it is a logic consequence , that they do not have additional time to take care of others . a good example for this phenomenon is the life style of a univeritz collegue . in order to being able to afford his study ( which mean : entry fee , course fee , book , ... ) , he is forced to work very hard besides univerity . it 's just impossible for him to additionally work voluntarily . and there are lot of case like him . but it 's probably not just a matter of possibility , but of will . people tend to be very focused on their own life , their own progression , their career . in order to achieve respect ( which in our society is very much associated with material success ) , one ha to be very focused one himself or herself . `` if you want to achieve something professionally , you should'n waste time '' , this is more and more common sense . and although i believe , that many positive , rather abstract advance arise when helping others voluntarily , i do not believe , that these advance are well recognised in our society . and a individuality is more and more a maxime at least where i live , it is a logical consequence , that people do not care so much for each other anymore .
