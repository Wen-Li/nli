to my mind , it is more important to understand concept and idea than to learn fact . i think it make student more intelligent by giving them the opportunity to developp their way of thinking . learning fact is useful for individual memory . it help to develop one 's memory by learning by heart fact , that is why kid learn a lot of song and poem by heart . learning fact is also useful for collective memory . for instance , student learn history to try not to repeat the same mistake a in the past such a the world wars . understand idea and concept make the student understand a way of thinking and a way to see the world . it can also help him to understand why the world is a it is . for example , understanding what american lived on the 9/11 and thought after can help to understand the present policy of the united states . furthermore , understanding idea and concept make the student able to develop his own thinking in order to undertstand other idea and concept . for example , if a student understand mechanic of fluid , he will be able to understand modelisation of traffic because both subject are based on the same theory . some university seems to think like me , giving right to all book and paper during their test but asking for a lot of explanation about concept and idea and relationship betw for all these reason , understanding concept and idea is the most important for student .
