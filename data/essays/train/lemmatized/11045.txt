the question being asked wheather successful people should try new thing and take risk or they should keep on doing what they already know and what they already do . this is an interesting topic since it is related with risk-taking by the people . in my opinion , i believe that people should try new thing and try to take risk if they can . i think , if we do some thing for a long time than we would already improve that skill and we would get bore of doing one thing again and again . and being a successful person there would be le chance of loss . or if there might any loss occured than it will not affect that person business much more . and , if we would do some different thing it can be good a far a change is concerned . if we have capability to take risk and to improve ourself than there is nothing wrong in taking risk . i am a pharmacist , so being a pharmacist i believe in research and development . and in research and development i try to innovate more and more useful drug which have low side effect and have high margin of safety . and for that purpose i believe in taking risk in changing already existing formula of any perticular formulation or drug . which can help me to invent new drug which is more advantageous than the existing drug . so , according to me , we should keep on trying to do new thing apart from what we do in our day to day curriculum . furthermore , i thing , during present time where each and every person try to gain more and more knowledge a compared to others . and for this everyone ha to take more chance to improve his skill and to become better than others . for example , if some one would not have taken risk of developing atomic bomb than we would not have been aware of that . in conclusion , i have shown that successful person should try new thing and take risk . since without risk , there will not be any development .
