many people think that product which are showen throgh advertising are real . but my opinion is that most advertisemens focus on making product look like better than they really are . because their function is to make product look nice to sell . and in the modern society which ha a lot of product , they have to get opportunity to sell throgh appearence of product . the advertisement is capacity to sell effeciently . that 's why they try to show the product seem much better than themselves . without using the product , nobody know ability of product . before the customer choose some product , they are hesitated . to them who are confused the choice , advertisement have to make them purchase thire own product . how ? through charming feactur . they have to suggest to the customer before they choose some product through that product seem nice . additionally , nowdays all technology have been improving . so the copy of some product is so easy . if some company invent the product which attract to the coustomers , a soon a other company also make similar product . in so many choice of same product , coustomers try to compare with other company . in same technology , it might be same ability of product . then , how to sell more than other companise ? the answer is the advertisement . but other company also try to make nice advertisement . then how to show that our product is better than other product ? the answer is to make product seem much better than they really are . nowdays business is unlimited competion world . but there is limited technology . that 's why most advertisement make effort that product look better than themselves and others . conclusionly , i am sure that most advertisement try to make product look better than they really are . that 's why the advertisement exist and in thesedays without showing well , the product can be choosed by coustomers .
