unfortunately i do not spend much time helping my community , but i admire everyone who doe it and try to support these people in other way ( e.g. donation ) . there are many reason for young pepole to spend time helping their community . some of them are listed below . on the one hand a commonly held view is that there is a growing solitude within our society an young people are looking for a family an friend . in germany every second marriage is being divorced and many child grow up in torn family . but a child need support and a person they can admire and they can identifiy with , they sometimes look for this support outside their family . therefore , there should be a growing number of young people joining organisation a the red cross or the local fire department . on the other hand , one ha to constate that there is a growing lack of time that hinders young people to join these organizstions . due tu a sharpening competition within society and due to a sinking number of job offering , child and young people might be forced to qualifiy on a vide range of sector . in order to get a got job nowadays , you have to be excellently educated , speak 2 language , have a lot of job expererience , be very young and pas at minimum one year abroad . as a consequence it seems more attractive for young people to spend their time maximizing their chance of getting a good job than to spend time helping their community . another point to consider is that helping community often go with a job which is not only requiring time but which is also not paid . it seems easier to do a job in a company . in a company you get paid for your work and it might be useful for your curriculum vitae having worked for that company . nevertheless , our society need people who work volunteerently in order to support their community . when your house burn you will be glad that some people work volunteerently for the lokal fire department , even though it is not useful for their curriculum vitae . to sum up , there are various reason for young pepole to give or to not give time to helping their community . my view is that there are still enough young people being engaged for their community and doing this for a number of different reason . as this work is very important for a society you should be very grateful these people spend their time helping their community .
