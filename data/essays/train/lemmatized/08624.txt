i would say that i do not agree neither disagree with both of the statement . personally i think that the truth is in the middle , a also the roman used to say . ideas and concept in order to be well explained need some fact to be related to . an idea could be difficoult to be explained , but with a fact , an example , the idea will be more clear to the student and also easier to be memorized . as an example , i can speak about the french revolution . what wa the idea at the base of the french revolution ? accorsing to this subject , in a class many idea can be explained by the teacher ( i would add in a boring way ) . supporting idea with fact ( for example explained the idea that led to the killing of the king ) would be more interesting for student and also more beneficial for their learning . many idea can be well explained , but to really understand them , we need to surround idea with fact , interesting fact , i would add . another example in which fact have to be strictly related to idea is for example if you want to descride a marketing concept to a student . of course the idea is really important because everytihg start from an idea , but also in this case in order to support the idea we need to drawn some conclusion speaking about fact . of course i am speaking about old idea , becuase what i stated before clearly do not match with new idea . how is possible speaking about a subjective theme like marketing and separate the idea at the base of a marketing campaing from the result ( the fact ) . in conclusion i would say that what i described is my opinion the best way of how to teach . i do not believe neither in class full of idea , neither in class full of real fact . as already stated both are importants , but also more interesting is the connection between them .
