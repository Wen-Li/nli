are you talking about just young people ! do you think that oldest people are much helping than young people to their community . is it a joke ? everyone think themselves in this world . you could be young you could be old , it doe not matter . world ha changed . unfortunatly this not the time of our grandfather 's . everyone ha been trying to keep it own territory . it could be popular in especially young people but it not their guity . it is not a beginning of everything . young people are just a result of what happened before them . so if you want to make them help to their community why do n't you start from the top of the sociaties . someones should have to show them how they would be good young people for their community . i mean i am not agree with that foolish idea about young people . if you want to decide somethings about a community you shouyld not separate the community . because the old people in the comminity did n't came from the space . once in a time they were young . so it 's not releated to young people . it 's related to our mind .
