yes , i agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . how a person is successful ? or you can ask why a person is successful ? the answer to this question is that ` it is all about the innovation ' , i.e. innovative mind . if you try doing new thing , innovative thing , definitely one will succeed in the area in which he is trying new thing . its not thet you are not successfull in one field than only you can try another field . people who are successful in one field , also try to be in another field and try to succeed in that , those people are successful people . their mind think differently , think innovative and unique thing . also if a person is doing a similar thing for longer period of time , he will get bored of it . so one should try doing different thing not for the sake of success only but for their own knowledge also . successful people never stick to one thing which they know how to do well but they always try doing different thing . there are many example of people who are very innovative . they are successful in one field but then also they try doing different thing in which they are new . and if hard work is done with dedication , nothing is impossible . there are many people who are very successful in their cinema career , sport etc but they tried politics also , and guess what , they are successful in that field also . that people were also new to politics , but they tried to manage both the field simultaneously . so what i think that a person should always try different thing and never stick to just one thing in life , not for success only but also for a change in life .
