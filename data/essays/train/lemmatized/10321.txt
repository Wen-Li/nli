a very famous saying go a `` be best at what you do '' . having excelled in a particular is more beneficial than having surface knowledge about many subject . we will only be respected if we excel in our chosen field . my first example will be from our academic life . even our education system follows the aproach mentioned above . as we reach eleventh standard we are asked to make choice from many subject because it is really important that we concentrate our mind one particular field . at the college level we further need to determine in which subject we want to do detailed study . this make our field of study narrower so that we put the best of our effort in one particular thing we want to pursue . my next example is from our social life . in a group discussion we should be adept at one topic about the issue in consideration rather than guessing little about each topic . arguing with people who have expertised in the similar area also increase our knowledge . another example is from the world of science . while doing the research work scientist do not need to know something about every subject but complete knowledge about what they are researching . this is even true for lawyer . fighting a case in a court doe not require you to have knowledge about how atom divide but eveything related to law . trying to know about every subject wll lead u to nowhere . therefore in light of the example mentioned above i conclude that it is better to specialize in one specific subjct than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject .
