there are a lot of thing that a good student have to do ; indeed , i think that to study in the right way ia a very difficult thing to do . it 's important for student to understand idea and concept . it 's important , in other word , to learn a lot of information about all the subject that a student is studing . for example a math student have to know , and to learn , and in particular way , to understand very well all the rule of his subject . if i think to my personal experience , it 's very important for me to study carefully , for a lot of reason , but two are the most important . fist of all for my personal knoledge , because only studying , in my opinion , i can know a lot of different thing and i can open my mind . second , only studying carefully , i can learn different and often difficult information . on the other hand , it 's important to learn fact too . it 's important to verify all the topic studied , in reality . it 's important to do practice about all the topic that a student have studied . the math student , after have studied a rule , have to do a lot of exercise about it to understand it , and at the same time it 's important to know what mathematics have done in their life , for example what they had studied . it 's important to read newspaper and to have information from the reality . an economy student have to know how business are going now in the world , and have n't only study economy from book . in conclusion i disagree with the statement because i think that both of these concept are important . if you study something and do n't do practice on the same topic or you have no notice about fact , you ca n't undertand in the right way this topic . in the same way if you know fact , but you have n't study before , you are n't study in the right way .
