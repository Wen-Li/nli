i am agree with the statement . concept is nothing but the theme of the topic . if your concept and idea about any particular topic is clear then you can add number of fact for that concept . facts are nothing but a type of example for any concept . for example theory of gravitation , newton ha invented the theory of gravitation . if your idea and concept about the theroy of gravitation is clear then you can think about number of fact based on this theory . you can apply your concept wherever you find suitable . but if your idea and concept is not clear then you would not be able to convey your opinion and fact . students should have clear idea about the topic that they are studying and also the concept behind topic should be clear . if your concept is clear about any topic then you can remember the topic easily and forever in your mind . and if you learn something based on fact rather then basic concept that will be harder to remember . for example news is a simple english word but if somebody explain you about this word i mean how the word news made , then it would be included in your never-loss-memory section of your mind . the news word made based on the following concept : news = north + east + west + south news word is the combination of first letter of four word ( north , east , west and south ) . so the word itself contains inforamtion about all four direction and give you information about all four direction . so this is the concept behind the word news . conclusion , as per a my opinion is concerned about the statement , ideas & concept behind any topic or subject should be clear , so that you can use that knowldge any time , any where , and forever .
