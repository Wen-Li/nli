i must say that i totally agree with the statement . as a student , i personally find more importsnt and useful to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . what is more , i think that the really important thing is not only to understand these idea and concept but also to study , to examine and to see how an idea or a concept lead to another and , thus , how fact appear a a part of the process , not a isolated thing that are recorded in our memory . understanding idea and fact help student , and people in general , to develope their logic and their analytical capacity . for example , let ' s talk about the french revolution . to me , it is easier and more useful to study it not a an amount of date , fact , name , event , etc , but a a conclussion of the social and political situation of europe in the 18th century : one thing lead to another and , at the end , studying it can even be funny , a a film in your mind , better than a long and boring list of non-sense word . furthermore , i consider memory a bad friend : you trust in it and , when you most need it , it leaf you alone , with no other help . when taking and exam , for example . if in your mind there are only fact , you can forget one and being unable to continue with the answer . on the contrary , if you have all the understanding process in your mind , maybe you won ' t be able to give a concrete date or a name , but you can explain the context or give other information that can help you to avoid a total disaster . to sum up , i think that understanding idea and concept will help u more than learning fact by heart , not only in our academic life but also in our everyday life .
