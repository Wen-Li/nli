we live in a society in which the enterprise and the industry can product everything becouse they reached a very important technological level required for the production . so their problem is how to sell their product . to aim this pourpose , industry use the powerful instrument of marketing . they have to convince people to buy their product instead of the product of the others . so they use the promotion to show their product to people through tv , paper , radio etc . then now some society have been reached a great visibility and these are well known by people . so costumer known what they want and what they want to buy ; they want to buy the producted that they know and that they have watched on tv or seen on a poster on some wall . but most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in fact , many le industry , to be able to sell their product , use all the system to product with the minimun cost . so the quality of their product is not so good . so to hide the low quality they use most advertisement to seems their product better . i think that advertisement are important for a society to show it product to people , but i m even sure that if the product doesn t satisfied him , the costumer will not buy it again . then i think that this fenomena had brought to another dangerous problem , the counterfait . the society that promot the counterfaited product use the advertisement of some grat industry to sell good with a very low quality .
