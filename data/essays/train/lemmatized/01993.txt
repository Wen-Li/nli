yes , i strongly agree with the statement . successful people always try news thing , implementing them at a great risk . these people will always try to develop new idea , implement them and create them incredible to the world . in the process , they keep an eye on the previous experience they had , rather than the people who just think about how to do , what to do and what not to do . for example , the person who organise & co-ordinate the event for the first time , doe n't get good appreciation for the work he did due to lack of experience . but , he is successful because he ha done the program to his best and even get lot of satisfaction . moreover , he even gain the managerials skill , responsibilty to face the failure , communication skill interacting with other people around the world like getting sponors for the event , a a part of process . moreover , he can even get the managerial skill like managing the thing effeciently and do the thing in time with consistence . later on , he go with the same project next year with all his previous expericenes and oragnises the event successful making an incredible work , none yet done ever before . he even get lot of support and encouragement from his fellow human who guide him all the way along motivating him to the desired field of his interest . the successful people are the only people who take responsibilty and risk factor beyond the imagiantion . moreover , the positive attitude , zeal to work hard for long hour and getting pratice in that particular course of study give much detail information , knowledge , expericence and satisfaction . thus , he is the successfull person rather than the person who doesnt do anything and doesnt work hard to get success and progress . instead , the unsuccessful people just think about what to do ? , how to do ? and what not to do ? the unseccessful people doesnt get progress a they are not interested and concern with that particular program or event being irresponsibility . finally , the successful people get much appreciation for their incredible work , implementing new thing with a major risk factor . whereas the unsuccessful people never get progress in their lifetime .
