many people in my country believe that learning fact for the student are more important than understanding idea and concept because when they student learn a lot of fact , it seems that they look intelligent and in general they get good grade on their test in school . however , i do not agree with this idea becaue when it come to learnig , understanding idea and concept allows u to use them outside classroom in a real society . besides , they enable u to explain and develop the reason and the way of the fact . first of all , when we understand idea and concept , we can use these idea when we leave our school . in other word , we can adapt them when we work and when we do some research . for example , if in englsih classroom you just memorize some grammar to take a test , you easily forget what you learned and memorized after taking the test . in the contrary , if you understand why and how this grammar is right or not , you will not forget this theory even after taking the test . moreover , when you speak and write english , you can utilize the theory you have learned . therefore , understanding is more usfule for the more study and the other area . secondly , understanding idea and conceps allow u to explain and develop an other concept in the future . in other word , it devotes the development of subject through doing the research based on the concept and theory that people have learned . for instance , when a graduate student want to do some research in math , the student ha to understand the concept and idea of math . and then , he start to do some research to develop the concept or idea that he want to prove . moreover , he can discover a new theory which is useful in the world . this is thanks to the accumulation of understanding idea and concept on his math area . in conclusion , undersatnding idea nad concept in some area is much more important than leraning fact becasue it is helpful to use and develop it outside classroom since it help people to be creative .
