nowadays car are the most common way to move . they have been created in the nineteenth century and had become rapidely important . cars became popular since it wa easier to move , in contrary to train you can go wherever you want especially when you have to do short distance . therefore why car in use will be fewer and what car company have to do to save their market ? cars in use will be fewer in twenty year . firstly the price of oil will still increase since their is tention between the occident and orient and therefore many people wo n't be able to drive anymore since it will be too expensive for them . moreover car act negatively on the environment , they will be point a guilty for the pollution . further more new way of transport are developped and will reduce the number of car : train are getting faster and more secure and plain deserve more destination . finally the licence to drive is harder to get , therefore every year le people can drive . cars company can react to this future discrease by two way . first of all they have to find new energy to substitute oil with an other more ecologic , like in brasil where people use energy from corn . they have also to discrease the price of the car so that more people will be able to buy one , like the new french car call logan who ha been lunched on the eastern europpean market . finally number of car wo n't discrease since new market open in india and china where almost three billion will be hypothetical buyer to conclude , i disagree with the following stament since new market will open and car company will research new concept like hybrid motor to keep their market .
