people have different opinion on whether young people do not give enough time to helping their friend . people who oppose this statement argue that helping friend is most important role in friendship . however , i supported this idea for two reason . let me explain reason in detail . first of all , nowadays youngster have lot of thing to do for their own . for this reason they usually do not pay attention to their friend ' problem and just concentrate their own work . let me take my experience a an example . when i wa in high school student , i had an car accident near my school . that day , our school had an important midterm examination . although it wa not seriou accident , i had to be care of by someone . however , for preparing test anyone helped me . my friend had to hit the book before the exam . so they just called teacher for me and went back to their class . i disppointed from them . therefore , nowadays teenager usually deal with their own work . next , recently people can find easily to solve the problem not from their community but also from other special institues . in the past , if teenager had a hard time to study , they asked their best friend and solved together . for example , if student who are not good at math , they can share the information how to study math . this is because they were same situation . however , today we have a lot of academic institute and private tutoring agency . therefore , young student have abundant source which can help them to solve their problem effectively . they can ask them how to study , what they have to take , and how to solve the problem . this show that young do n't have time to share theirtimt wiht friend . in conclusion , i agree with the idea which is that recently young people do not have enough time to concerning their friend . as i mentioned above , they are suppose to focus on their own job . in addition , they can solve their problem by contacting other source around them .
