in my opinion , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for the following three reason . first , even though there will be a lot of people that will need car to move , for example to go to work , and the population of the world will increase , peolpe will have other possibility to move and travel . for example , a lot of place and location will be connected by train , plane more than today . so that , even if people have the possibility , even nowadays , to travel with train or plane , in the future , they will use better service . second , if nowadays there is the problem of the pollution because of the traffic , the smog , i can immagine what it will be in twenty year . the sky will be so grey that the only solution , maybe , it will be to not use car anymore or use le car than today . so , people will go bike or or will use car with no dangerous engine . third , maybe in twenty year new model of car or way to travel and move will be invented . the air is not so clean and the street are too full of car that we need a solution and what it is important is that we need somebody to project and create a new way to move . the problem is that there are too many car that fill the street . to avoid this risk it is important to find other way . to sum up , the presence of infinitive number of car in the world , pollution , and the invention of other way for travelling are good reason why in twenty year there will be fewer car in use .
