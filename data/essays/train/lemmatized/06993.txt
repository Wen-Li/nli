i disagree with that statement . nowadays , a lot of highschool student look for summer job a soon a their academic year end . those job consist of helping out in various store in a shopping mall , performing simple task in a clinic , or catering in a restaurant , or hosting an event and there are lot more . it also depends on the what type of young people the statement is referring to . if it is referring to spoiled , rich teenager then i would understand , since all they have been taught to do is to just request whatever they wish for without earning it . although , there are several other case which young people are normal student who recieve average amount of pocket money every month given by their parent . at a certain point , those young people soon realise that the pocket money most of the time will not be enough to get what they need or want . that is when they start working and looking for job even at a hospital for the elderly . most of the job vacancy out there are being occupied by young teenager , and they are actually more enthuisiastic than older people when they go through their job . most of my classmate in college always volunteer to help out with charity work . the amount of student who actually showed up to donate and help out with organising wa so shocking that the older member were extremely impressed . in my point of view , younger people are far more creative at organising an event especially for younger people 's interest . for instance , when it come to organising a music concert in order to collect the money for donation , it is always done best by a young person in his or her late teen , since they know what type of music and who the younger generation like to listen to nowadays . that way the concert will turn out to be successful and they could earn a good amount of money for charity .
