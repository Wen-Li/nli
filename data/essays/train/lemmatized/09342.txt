successful people are really try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . we live in an amazing world . things change , people change . how could be successful if you just go along the road that all the people already know how to do well . yes , it 's true that some thing and rule are still right . people need to eat everyday , so i open a resteraunt . so how could not i make money . but when others run it too , how could you make sure that you can still make money . so you need to change , you need to try new thing , you need to take risk , or others will change , and then , you just destroy yourselves . who know that computer will become extremely popular several decade ago . and people just thought that the bill gates person wa so stupid . what if he go and see and do some law thing his father just wished rather than trying new thing and take the big risk to go on with his computer and software . well we may ca n't fly into the sky some year ago , but after the brother used their life to take the risk , you see what we can do now . no risk , no win . that 's our chinese old word . without the risk , how could we see the new country in the north ameria land . maybe some work do not change , but the way we do them must be changed . if there are no the new thing , how could the world develop itself . all the thing are still same a a couple of year ago , the shop is still the shop , the stuff you can buy are still them , i can not imagine that .
