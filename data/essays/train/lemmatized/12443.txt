well , enjoying life doe n't really depend upon how old we are , provided , one is interested in giving time for oneself and one 's joy . in most of the case , yes , it 's true that young people enjoy life better than most of the old people do . one of the reason why this happens is that , young people generally do n't have much of responsibility a old people do . a school-going or a college-going girl ha only one major responsibility in life . thats is to study . apart from that , she ha no tension and worry , usually . whereas , old people have a lot of responsibility . older people generally get busy with work and responsibilties concerned with work apart from the responsibities at home . elder people get to manage the family economically also . they need to take care of every family member and their necessity . another important factor that refrain old people from enjoying their life , going out and partying kind of stuff , is expense involved in these . it would n't be a big problem for a 20 year old guy to spend $ 20 or $ 30 for a movie or spend more in a restaurant or a party . but , old people , a they take the responsibilty of the whole family , do n't generally prefer to spend so much on a so-called `` luxury '' but will want to spend that money on some useful item for the house so that everyone is benefitted by their expense . another factor is enthusiasm . old people , usually , are n't a energetic a young people are and so they ca n't spend much time spending much energy in anything . whereas youth are full of energy and spend more time having fun and enjoying than old people do . to conclude , there should be balance in anyone 's life . people , irrespective of age or financial status should spend some time having fun and enjoying life than spending most of their life dedicated to work .
