i belive that it is much more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i feel that it is useless if student rely on memorizing fact only , this is because a life go on , what stick to our mind is what we understand and comprehend , and not what we siply memorize . generally speaking , it is very difficault to memorize a fact without first understanding it . take the process of photosynthesis in plant a an example , i remember very well trying to memorize all the complicated step and stage involved in this process without first understanding them , and what did i get ? nothing . it wa a complete waste of time and energy . yet when i went back to my biology teacher , and after explaining it to me , i found it much easier to memorize and comprehend . hence to me personally , undersatnding the idea and concept is a must-do before even thinking of starting to `` learn the fact '' as we go through every experince in life , whether it is a learning experience , or just an every day experience , we make sure to understand what is going on around u , hence we try a hard a we can to get involved . when we simply learn fact , we are not involved in the actual process of learning , and we can not therefore enjoy that feeling of pride that a person get when understanding a challenging task or peice of knowledge . for exapmle , if a student memorises a mathemetical question , it would be a complete wate of energy and time , yet when that student truly understands that task , he/she will never forget it and will positively benifit from that true learning experience . even when we talk about the regular day-to-day task that one always go through , we see , again , that it is a very important to understand a task before memorizing it . take the simple process of tying a shoe ! it is very important that the child know the basic idea of that simple process and watch it several time analysing it , before actually learning those simple fact . finally , we conclude that it both understanding the concept and learning the fact are way of learning that at many time can not be separated . i believe that understanding the idea and concept are still more important a they are the first step in the process of learning .
