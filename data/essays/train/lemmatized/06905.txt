it is stated by some that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in time we have seen that the use of car ha increased and in my opinion , the possibility of it decreasing are very low . the automobile industry is just starting to develope and improve it self . they are finding new way to satisfy a customer 's need and to attrackt a variety of people . nowadays there are car for all type of activity , which come in many shape , color and size . they appeall to the young generation also , making car that are equipped with the latest technology . family car are much more comfortable and the image of the traditional sport car ha changed . since people are becoming more and more concerned with polution , car manufacturer have been trying to come up with a car that work on natural energy . of course , a car like this is really expensive , but it may soon become a most wanted car . i believe that the car industry is evolving along with the need of our time and is making out of car a need to have object . and a more people can afford a car , due to the economical improvement , sale will grow all around the world . car industry may one day reach place that are in state of poverty right now , but that in twenty year or more will step into a better economical situation . so this can only increase sale . we are also finding new way to connect part of the world that have been isolated from the rest of the world . so a new road to travel are made , need to travel in will be extremely necessary . finally , i believe that in the future , although it might change it form , car will always be used and even by a larger amount of people .
