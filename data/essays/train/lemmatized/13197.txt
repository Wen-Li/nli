most of the people believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better . they think that whether they know everyhing about a subject or not is n't important . in contrast to these , i believe that specializing in one specific subject is better than having knowledge of many academic subject . i always give importance to complete a job that i work on . it is n't enough for me to do only some part of it . i think , for getting a success it is very important to complete the job . eveybody want to have broad knowledge but there is an important point , do you specialize on it or do you know only a part of it . in daily life , there is lot of people who are trying to talk about a subject whether they have a knowledge about it or not . i do n't agree with it . if i do n't have a knowledge about a subject , i wo n't talk on it , i will only listen people to get their idea and learn something about this subject . if i want to specialize in this subject , i begin to research about it . and for day i study on it for having the true knowledge . on the other hand , i always try to add knowledge to my knowledge day by day dy . because i know that for getting a success , a person should be adaptable to change . i do n't forget a discussion about this situation with my best friend . we are talking about tennis . i have been playing tennis since 1991 . i know every detail about tennis . however , my friend never play tennis . she asked me a question about a racket and i g'ce information about her question but she said she know better than me . and she began to give wrong information to my friens . and after this experince , i decide not to talk on a subject that i do n't know or only know a part of it . in conlusion , i always think that foir getting success it is not better to have broad knowlede than specialize
