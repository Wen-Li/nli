i do n't agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are some reason to dislike to be led by a tour guide while i am traveling in a group . it is not agreeable to my taste . first , our time is restricted by a tour guide . that 's mean that we ca n't go somewhere freely . at my culture trip on my school event , we ca n't behave freely because there is a guide . we have ecperience many time . we ca n't behave freely . it is hard for u to spend , because ew have to write report about the place , so we have to be led by a tour guide even we do n't like it . second , a tour guide sometime tell a lie . last week , i had a culture trip in switzerland . i had prepared against report trip , but they are not accorded between the explanation of the document that i had prepared and the explanation of a tour guide , so sometime i am confused , so it is trouble for me to write the report . finally , i think that the best way to travel in a group is that to behave ownself . this action is very good for experiencing somr thing in that place . this thing is happy for enjoying at that place . to be led by a tour guide is not happy and awful . sometime the explanation of a tour guide is unuseful and not interesting , so many people shoud travel by own . sometime we can learn something that a tour guide doe n't know . wherever we go , what ever we find . there are something who doe n't know , so when people travel , they should not ask a tour guide , it ca n't enjoy and become bad trip , so we need to travel without a tour guide .
