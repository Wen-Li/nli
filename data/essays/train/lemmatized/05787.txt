i disagree with this statement . i do not think that the helping their community of the young people is decreasing . that is why i know many student around me tried to attending community and helping them . for example , one of my friend attended the community of volunteer for hansensi disease . he went to china and saw the facility with his own eye . he now also keep trying to help the people who are segregate from the society because of their disease . other friend attend to the community of helping the forign student . once a week , she attend a class with the foregin student and help note taking and assignment . i understand that the student are very busy because of class , assignment and communication with friend and love . however we can make the time even how hard it is . on the other hand , i think that nowadays there is a problem with communication around the social community . it is not because of the lack of the time . it is because of the lack of the relationship among the social community . for my example , i do not know the neigbors . i do not know wether he is student or not . it can be why i stay alone , but it is strange . i think that making the relationship among the social community strong lead to the safety world . if knowing each other very well , the crime is going to smaller . what i mentioned is the young people tried to be aggressive to attending some community and helping them . however we need more communication among the people of social community . it lead to the safety world . i dissagree with this statement . i do not think not giving enough time to helping their community . we can make time even how busy we are . the problem is the lack of communication .
