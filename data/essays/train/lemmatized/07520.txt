cars are the major mean of transportation in most of the developed country of the world . this is the result of the advancement in the technology and the efficiency of the car . in the developing country train , bus are the primary mean of transport within the country . with the increase in the population the number of car on the road ha increased . this ha caused a lot of trafic issue . the rising gas price ha also added to the existing car population on the road . the number of accident on road ha increased enormously out of proportion . nowadays there are potential life threatening situation travelling by car than any other mean . more people are delayed to work because of the increasing trafic even on the highway . some are unfortunate enough to miss even their interview . so most people think that there will be fewer car in use than ther e is today . i personally think that it is true . though there are plenty of reason to say no to car , it ha it own advantage . we do n't have to wait in long hour after missing a bus , train or a plane either . the car journey is more comfortable . we can take break in the rest area and relax ourselves during a journey . sometimes we even donot feel the journey 's tiredness . its also le expensive . we will be able to manage our kid more easily in car than on bus . with the help of modern technology we can make them watch their favourite cartoon or movie during a car travel . when i consider the advantage of car i get confused about my opinion . i think that people are facing my present situation of using car a their future mean of transport . but with the rising gas price and trafic congestion my opinion is to choose bus over car . hence i conclude that there might be fewer car than today after twenty year .
