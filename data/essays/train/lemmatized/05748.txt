i do'nt agree with the statement . the first reason is that there are no other transportation better than car . cars are acctually covenient . from door to door we can go anywhere we want . especially with a big baggage or small child . no one disturb u in the car . so there are few person who want to give up drive with their car . on the other hand , we have many problem with car . for example , traffic jam and dificulty of findind parking . as the increasing of car , those kind of problem became bigger than before , still , i do n't think it will cause people give up driving car . this kind of disadvantage is tolerable . the advantage of using car are bigger , and there may be energic problem to car . the oil stock will be exhausted in near futuer , but , to my mind , industrial progress will give u other energic power such a water or sollar power to move car . therefore this shortcoming of using car will not have good reason . then , how about other transportation ? as for train , the 'll cost a lot to make rail and keep land . plains also cost to move on . car is conpact and flexible . in additon , the second reason i think we will continue to use car are that car are someway have role a our fasion . many people are euthusiastic to chose one 's car . having car is a kind of status of people . so , nevertheless some more convenient and smart machine are prevented , we are using car more and more . and i do n't think no other transportation which fit people better than car will be prevent in twenty year .
