i strongly agree this statement . generally today people are more and more interested buying car a an important necessity , and this trend doe not seem to stop for the time being . however in twenty year a lot of change will happens , such a technology will be advanced better , cyberspace will be more wider , and the concept of space will diiffer . first , in twenty year , there will be considerable change and advance in technology . that mean new vehicle will appear instead of big car . just think of the past . when people used only cart or bicycle , they may think that kind of vehicle are essential to their life . who could imagine car or airplains ? similarly , we may not need car ant more in twenty year . totally different vehicle , more convenient , more safe , will surely appear . second , more and more people now can work and study at home without moving . that is because we can use cyberspace or network system freely and efficiently . people maybe do not want crowded street , wasting precious time and taking risk of car accident any more . we wiil not need the vehicle itself in twenty year . third , many scientist from many country now are working on discover more space over the earth . if it come true , the concept of space will be different at that time . we can use only car on the street on the earth , but we can not use car in the air in other planet . in different environment , we will use different vehicle or extremely we may not need any vehicle . in short , i think the use of car is just appropriate for now . a lot of change will happen , though we can not imagine what will be like . cars are just the useful invention of now , but it will be useless after human are sick of them . there is no limit of human 's satisfaction .
