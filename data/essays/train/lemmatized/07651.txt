i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time for community service and i do not attribute some change in the youngster character that ha brought this undesirable contribution towards their society . my parent give numerous example regarding their participation in the betterment of the community and i always feel that iam unable to do a much a they did . not only me , all the youngster of present age are unable to allocate sufficient amount of time for their community . this may be because of many reason . firstly , because the present day life is like a race . the competition ha been increasing day by day and only the strongest and efficient can survive . in this race the youngster are not finding enough time to serve the society . secondly , the modern day student ha a lot of thing to do ; he ha a lot to learn within the time . he ha to take care of not only his academic but also exta curricular activity . this make clear that he ha le time for other thing . for example i had to attend the computer class and also music class which were compulsory for all in our school . moreover the concept what my parent learned in their time , iam learning them at an early age . so the complexity ha increased and requires more time to understand . we do community service in the short time we are having . we celebrated all of our friend ' birthday in the final year of my undergraduate school in an oldage home where we could help them to some extent . so i think it is logical to say that the present generation yougsters are contributing le time to serve the society than the earlier generation . it is not because we are not willng to do do but we are forced to some other thing .
