i agree with this statement , student must more understand idea and concept than to learn fact . one moment can amphasize my agreement , evry time teatchers are asqued their student if they understand and if they having question . question like this wa asked and will be asked by teacher to know if student understand leaning material . by understandng idea and concept student can use these knowledge more productively . it 's give possibility to apply idea and concept in another domain . only if the student understand idea an concept , they will be able keep them for a long time in their life and transmit them so clairly . for example seriouly undestanding basis of physic may be applyed to build road in thery bad geological condition . we know that knowledge of physic permit mankind to fly to cosmos . contrariwise , leaning fact can help some time but no so effectivly like understanding idea an concept . here , it difficult to use learning fact . because here information seems superficially to be applyed in a given domain . therefore , the very important attention may be done in the understandind of idea and concept than in learning fact . it must be a credo of teatching . and this approch will be transmitted from generation to generation of teatchers . only like that thde teaching will stay an art .
