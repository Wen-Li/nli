the question whether is it more important to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in just one specific subject is not easy to answer . personally , i am the opinion that a broad knowledge is worth more than a narrow but specialized knowledge . however , the business world call for specialist all the time . back in the past allrounders were highly appreciated but nowadays there are just a few left . well , this doe not apply in general but at least to the business i know , the law business . as a lawyer it is necessary to be specialized to ensure one achieves the best solution for the client . but still , i believe that broad knowledge open new horizon . now i am not only referring to business but also to private life . having knowledge in various area also mean to have more information . information one can use to make up one 's mind and to see thing in a totally new perspective . this actually is why i believe broad knowledge is worth so much . only with this knowledge it is possible to understand different culture , to enjoy foreign music , art or simply to have an interestin talk with the neighbor who come from a different country . with these new possibility a totally new world is offered to the one that are open to information on different subject . and get back to business : who doe really want to talk to a lawyer who only understands the law but not the real problem ? i doe not . therefore i am the opinion that broad knowledge is more important to to be specialized on just one subject . although , it is not easy to obtain knowledge in different field , if one ha a full-time job , it is worth to spend the spare-time to gather information on other topic and subject , provided one is interested in them . summarized i can say , that i try not to become to specialized too early and to obtain a broad knowledge . i think it is very important .
