it is definitely important for student to understand idea and concept rather than learning fact because fact are based on idea and concept . there always is some concept in the process to reach for a particular fact . so if a student is not clear in his/her idea or concept he will definitely have some problem in finding a particular fact about something . let u take an example . suppose that there is a student working on some physic paper . now he come across a point of `` work '' . and he notice that the formula for force is work = force * displacement ( force multiplied by displacement ) now if the student doe not know anything about `` displacement '' , i.e. whether a positive or a negative displacement , he will be confused . another important thing is that the `` fact and figure '' , that we make use of while understanding the `` idea or concept '' , are also based on some concept . working on a concept with some fact lead to a new `` fact '' . we sometimes take an example of newtons third law of motion in our everyday life . the law state that `` every action ha an equal and opposite reaction '' . suppose we hit the wall with our hand , it definitely hurt . the reason for this is that when we apply force on a body it reacts to it at the same moment the force is applied . we never wonder why we are hurt . this also ha many reason . first of ll the third law of motion prompt the wall to react back . secondly the density of the wall is more than our hand . because if we hit a bag of cotton with the same force it wont hurt here we have made use of fact and concept both . we see that `` fact '' and `` concept '' are interrelated but it is very important to understand the concept and idea before we try to learn or arrive at any fact . moreover if we dont understand any idea or concept we just keep on working on the known fact . but if we concentrate on the concept or idea about a particular thing , it may be that we develop a new fact about it .
