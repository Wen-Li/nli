the main point of car is the more and more a problem in our day , it implies social and economics statement , that are contested by ecological fact . even though car pollute , i tend to disagree with the statment given by the subject : '' in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' i will give three main reason why i think there will be more car in twenty year from now . first of all in twenty year , the earth 's population , will tend to be almost nine billion of people , wich is a overpopulation of course , so i think the more people there are the more car there are . to continue , people usually prefer to take a car than to walk , now we can say that some of them will take public facility , but after all , a bus , is only a big car ... whereas others facility , are not really develloped in all contries , and people usually prefer going in a private car rather than in a common facillity . last but not least , the more reaserch are done to find a clean car , a car wich does'nr pollute at all , by using elctricity and even solar sistems . as long a we have clean car , and a very large number of person , few reason will last in contrasting the supperiority of car . so , we can say after this explaination , that there wo n't be fewer car in twenty year from now , but instead , more car , and even more efficient car .
