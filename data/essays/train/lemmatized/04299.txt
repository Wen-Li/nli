i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first of all , of course , all advertisement are made to promote sale of product . therefore , maker and advertisement agency are always trying to do their best to make the product look nicer in the advertisement . they use a lot of technique to do this . although some institution check the quality of advertisement to avoid bad expression such a untrue expression or exageration , it is easy to make product look nicer in advertisement without making lie . for example , how do people feel when a well-known actress who is a groumet say this product is really delicious ? people believe it is more delicious . and this is not a lie if it is not delisious to a customer , because this expression depends individual ' taste . this inclination of attractive advatisements is also helped by the fact that most of the product can not be tried by the comsumer before the product are bought . that is some product such a clothes can be seen prior to pay , however , most of the product such a food can not be tasted pior to payment . therefore , attractive advertisement are effective . so people make advitisement that make product seem much better than they really are . actually we know a lot of the procuts which were popular at the time of starting by the advertisement but lost the popularity soon . this fact show that those product were le attractive than the one in the advertisement . to conclude , i think it is true that most advertisement seem much better than they really are . it is unavoidable fact , if we consider the character of the advertisement itself .
