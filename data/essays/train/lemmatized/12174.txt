`` life is a game , if we do n't try , we wo n't know what treasure are there '' this sentence i heard my father when he decided to quit his job and to begin a new career . fifteen year ago , my father served in military , but right now he is a successfual business man . some people like to try new thing and take risk . other tend to only doing what they already know how to do well . i totally agree with this sentence because of my father . it is extremely difficult to be success if people d , do n't take risk or how do they know how to be success . as my father an example , when my father wanted to qiut his nice job which work for government and ha nice salary , all his family disagree with my father and only my mother supported him because my mother know that if my father keep doing his same job , my father 's life is that ' all . even though my father had a hard time on his new job but now he get to it very well . he make more money than when he wa a army . another support reason is to try new thing and take risk help people to obtain different experience to be success . for example , when my father wa an army , he only knew to obey oder and to be royal to his government and nothing else ; however , since he got rid of his job , he commounciate with this world , talked to people and be familiar with this society . he ha gained different knowledge from what he learned in military school , although my father is not major in business , because of his own background , it provides my father to do business darling and people like to exchang business with my father . satying in same position is not bad ; however , if people want to be successful , to try new thing or take some risk are necessary .
