i agree this opinion and think there are some reason for it . before i state possible reason for that , i explain why i think young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communmities . in my own experience , i did not attend community activity like cleaning or helping older people very much . i think it is not only my case but it hold true of other young people around me . therefore i feel this opinoin is true . then why this happen ? it is often said that local community bond wa much tigher before and people help each other and give much time to helping thier community . for example , if it is hard for a family to take care of their child or elderly people , other family near the family help them . opposite is also done . if there are some problem , local community help each other . i think it worked well before . that is so-called give and take spirit . moreover , there were not tv game or computer , so child played with neibours . that helped child to mede friend with other child or communicate other adult member of the community . however , thesedays such community bond bacame weaker . i don not say it doe not exsist at all , but few community work well . because society bacame rapid and young people busy with their own work and prefer to do thier own thing . they lack time and also lack effort to join . that is a problem . therefore if this tendency continued , it would cycle generation to generation . i think we have to see our comunities more and engage in helping .
