i think that tihs is a very important consideration but i don ' t agree because in my opinion practise and concept are important at the same level . for example during the prepararion for an exam the student ha to understand base concept but he ha to know the way to applicate this idea in practise . it is necessary a global culture but he ha to have the way to work in practise for show thier capacity . for most student this is a great problem after the finish of the school because they go work and do n't know how to solve the problem in the reality . in my opinion it is necessary to change the actual way of teaching , especialy in the scientific course , because the teacher ha to show practical thing and not only explain the idea . to made this a school can organise external collaboration with industry and involves student to collaborate in stage and other activity . i think that this way of teaching must be used not only in university but also in the previous institute so that a student can be ready for the working world . because of the high number of student it is necessary to spend a lot of money to build practise laboratory and to improve this new way of teaching . a last consideration is that the student must show more interest in some field in order to understand their own charateristics and they try to be more collaborative in the activity of the school .
