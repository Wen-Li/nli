the following essay focus on the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do . from my point of view there are lot of thing that make me feel like agreeing with this statement . for example younger people are usually not that setteled or depending on other person , which make you enjoy life more and live freely . in younger year one doe n't think that much about the difficulty of life that may appear later on , such a illness or financial security problem . furthermore one usually go to college or university in younger year where life is most of the time a whole lot of joyful fun anyway , apart from some learning time . so yes , i would say that the circumstance in your younger year make it often more easy to really enjoy life than in older year . but on the other hand i think - and i can only think about it because i am in my younger year at the moment - the older people a well have their very own way of enjoying life . surely they 'll do it in a different way because it 's not all about party and having fun , but with a life-experience i am sure one can enjoy life at a different level . looking back on what offered life for you , everything you 've been already able to enjoy and all the good and bad you 've gone through i think one can enjoy life a much a young people . apart from that i can imagine that a lot experience , which you definitley have a an older person , can give a good measure a well concerning what is really worth to enjoy and what is not . so to bring it up to a point i would n't say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . perhaps both group enjoy and spend their time in different way but in total i am sure that both are able to enjoy at a similar level .
