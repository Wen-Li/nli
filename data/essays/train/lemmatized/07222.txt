colleges nowdays offer a huge variety of class . books on library shelf talk about every subject one could think of . people , student in particular , are left wandering wheter it 's better to concentrate on something in particular or on many different subject . i believe it is better to have a broad knowledge , basically for three reason . first of all when you go to college the maturity of adulthood is still far away . seldom have i met undergraduate student who already knew what they wanted to do in life . because of this i think one should try to develop a broad knowledge on different subject . a borader knowledge will give you a broader perspective to life , an open mind and the ability to make the best of the opportunity life will give you . in addiction to that , personally i would never spend three or more year of my life specializing on the same subject . i know there are people who do , and some of them seem to like it : for instance my friend girolamo ha been studying the behaviour of earth worm for the whole last semester ! i could never do something similar . concentrating on the same matter for too long can be boring . stuying is already so difficult , facing new issue and interesting matter often can help to cope with the burden of the deadline , midterm paper , book , and so on . this is worth for young student but for adult a well . in conclusion statistic have been carried out on people who attended class on different subject when they were at college , which basically mean they have a borad knowledge rather than a specialized one . the result show that they usually have higher wage than people who concentrated on a specific academic subject . this of course doe not mean that taking up photography and biology will make you a better person than someone who know plato 's `` republic '' by heart , or ha studied french for all his life . but it doe mean than generally you will be more adaptive , which is a key quality in nowdays everchanging world .
