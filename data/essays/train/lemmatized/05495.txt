whenever i plan for traveling , i consider whether to travel in a group led by a tour guide or to travel individually without a tour guide . however , even though there are some people who prefer to travel individually , i like to journey following an instructor . as i have experienced in both way , i believe there are more advantage to travel in a group led by a tour guide . first , traveling with a tour guide make people be more comfortable . for example , when i travel following a tour guide , i feel comfortable about not thinking of the direction of the new place . the instructor had already planned where our group wa supposed to visit , eat , and book the hotel , so there wa nothing i worried about . second , it is safe to travel with a tour guide . because the tour guide know where we go , there is le chance to be lost in the foreign country . also it is more comfortable to travel with a person who can communicate in the language of the country which i do not know . last , it is easier to get information of the place where we travel . since guiding is his or her work , the instructor know information about where he or she take people . thus , people who travel within a tour guide easily get close to the new information a they listen to the instructor . when i visited europe , i wa fullfilled with the question of the history of where i travel such a `` winter castle '' in russia and alps mountain in switzerland . because i did not know how to speak english at that time , there wa no way to ask to resident . however , with the tour guide 's help and information , i could satisfy with what i wanted know easily . with these reason , i disagree with the statement , `` the be wat to travel is is a group led by a tour guide . '' it is more comfortable and safeto travel where i do not know much about it .
