i 'm completely agree with this sentence . in fact i beleave that i live in the generation of advertising . in this period what the people say is more important than the real quality of a product . on television or on the page of newspaper there are always an infinity of sponsored product : shoe , t-shirt , cap , but also ham , biscuit or different type of cheese . we can find all type of product . all day my prefered football player or the champion of the world of tennis suggest me what is the product better for me and how i have spent my time . and i do n't buy a particular object only for it quality or it price , but also because i see it on journal . this is the scope of marketing : `` to make product better than they really are '' . this is an economic law and some firm know it very well . the same product with different brand ha two different value , it is caused by continous advertising . really this product are not better than other without a famous brand , often they are product of low quality , but only with a good testimonial or a good sponsor .
