one would be glad to find a single person today who is not worried about the rising gasoline price , and the burgeoning traffic jam ! the gulf state the major producer of oil have been foreboding for long that they have alreday reached their maximum limit and the produce fo oil is only going to plummet from here on . all this spell evil for the car manufaturers . cars though expensive have some clear advantage over public transport but it is losing this advatnge a fast pace . not only are they becoming more and more uneconomical to drive the traffic situation challanges the other advanatges it ha i.e. of quicker transport . comparing this with a more efficient public transport system which is way cheaper considering the rising gasoline price and is much more quicker considering the worsening traffic jam situation . anyone would be enticed to use public transport rather than use private transport i.e car . necessity is the mother of invention the man need to move made him invent the car but this is being challanged in a number of way these day . off recently number of company have started offering option of work at home , univeristies have started course which are internet learning based . all this ha reduced the need for people to move and hence eliminating the need of car form our life . and a we move from a manufacturing based economy to an information based one the need of the transport is going to decrase further a people would prefer to stay at home and work . though there are certain thing that might just save the fate of that beatle in your garage , might be an electric car , which might be cheaper to run a we find more and more renewable souirces of energy and might be much smaller in size and hence solving the traffic issue . but all this is ot far fetched untill some solid discovery are doen we can easliy say all this spell doom for the existence and number of car .
