people make new thing , invent new thing that may become popular but if they do n't improve their thing or try new thing somebody do a more interesting than theirs and people forget the success that they give earlier time . as a result of it bill gates , the richest man in the world , will be publishing new type of program every month or every two month . because he doe n't want to lose his reputation and there are so many company that want to see their program make a better profit than him , sell more copy than microsoft , bill gates ' company , doe . so he want his company to the keep improving and to make new product to the computer user . also a basketball or a soccer player need to improve himself and try add new thing to his playing style . because if do n't try new move and make regular move that they are doing all the time , the opponent can control them easily , defender can defend them easily . and if they keep playing in the same way they ca n't have an effect on match so even they can be cut from the team and broke . in soccer , ronaldinho who is the best player for this decate for a lot of people say that he is so successful because he improves himself everyday and keep looking for new dribling skill that when a defender will see them in a match defender will be suprised and he get passed of defender easily . in conclusion , i think that successful people should try new thing rather than doing the same thing over and over again . so that they ca n't be just wannabe and people love them and love what they done . as we can see many real example of this .
