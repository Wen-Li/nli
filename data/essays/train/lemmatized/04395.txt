i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their community . we can see that in the increasing lack of staff in charity organisation and lack of volunteer in elderly home and orphanage . however , there are three reason that can justify why young people are n't available for such service a their counterpart had been thirty or fourty year ago . first of all , the educational requirement have increased on the average and hence the time required by young people to obtain the necessary qualification . thirty or forty year ago a diploma wa good enough to practice medicine , have your own clinic or work in a hospital with a good salary . nowadays you need much more than that , at least one master degree and several research a well a a membership of a well-known medical body like the royal assembly of british surgeon . the same applies to all level of education required to perform certain job . second come the fact that education , and life in general , is becoming more and more costly . this forced many young people to go to work early in their life to support themselves or even their family sometimes . in fact , most of college and post graduate student in some area are part time student and part time worker . this ha placed heavy pressure on the free time available for charity activity the situation becomes even worse if these young people decided to have family with one or two child . in this case the demand would be increased so much that some of them go home for only three to four hour to rest and spend the remaining hour working in more than one job or taking care of their child or studing , in case they were ambicious and persistent enough to do that . we now come to the third reason in my opinion which is entertainment . this can be subdevided into two subcategories . first is the little time left , if any , for relaxing and enjoying , after the previous two reason i mentioned . in this case young people prefer to spend such time in having fun and enjoying themselves rather than engage in an activity that will help the society but be more depressing to them . the other subcategory is the abundance and diversification of entertainment mean that did n't exist two or three decade ago . such abundance and diversification is much more tempting to young people than working in an elderly house or decorating the street . they can select between cinema , club , different kind of sport or musical party . and all exist in each of their area . thiry year ago there would be only one or two mean of entertainment and not working all the time even . that is the way i can interpret the increasing lack of interest by young people to help their community .
