i disagree with `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' it is just like advertisement tell a lie to consumer . for example , when my father watched a cm of clearner product on tv , advertisement said that it could erase all of thing such a , coffee or ink . after he used it , it could not erase coffee one . it wa not ture that the cleaner could erase coffee . he wa really angry with it , and he said he would never buy priducts at the company . as a consumer , you can not know about product which you can not use for a test before you buy it . you just watch some cms of a prodict or look a product in the store . the other view is advertisement is to sell product a lot to consumer , so it might be natural thing for them to make product seem much better than they really are . however , that is really big criminal at the point of telling a lie . becuse of that , consumer should need to compare with other product , and you should decide by yourself which one is good . also you have to use our mind and think about `` is that cm really true ? `` . finally , advertisement should make product seem they really are ; otherwise , consumer will nerver trast them . also it should be a big problem .
