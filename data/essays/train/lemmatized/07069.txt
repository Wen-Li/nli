i disagree that , successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . because doing known thing perfectly is also equally difficult . also , doing known thing well is not easy . intially , for a person to be successful he or she need to be perfect in their respective field . so , it is better to master in known field then in unknown area . in a known area , a person wil be more confident in his or her work . for example , a doctor performs operation in his known area but not on other part of the body , where his area of study is not concerned . another hypothetical case is , in a known area a person can assume the output . but in an unknown area , a person ha no garuntee of success . and also , what to expect a the output . for example , various explorer known their destination point , only then they start their travelling . moreover , for experimenting new thing more money would be required . hence , the person should be confident completely before putting huge amount at stake . for example , funding for satelite where huge money is involved , so much research must be done . also , successful is obtained by combining dedication towards the work , talent , commitment , intelligence and many more feature . also , these quality can be combined only when there is qaruntee about the output . for example , nasa scientist doe so much research before working on a new project . they woud not start work in unknown area where there is no qaruntee of output . finally , i conclude by mentioning that success is obtained by those people who are confident in what they are doing . hence , successful people should do thing what they already know rather than taking risk .
