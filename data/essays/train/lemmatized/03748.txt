the technology ha been improved so much past decade , solving all sort of problem that we had , and still keep developing . even though the technology is fast improving , there are major problem remaing which is increasing of car that polluting our enviroments . i cast doubt that twenty year is too short time to prove the problem . first , the speed of developement in technology is unbelievably fast . no one thought that they can talk to each other and see each other in same time with the wireless phone . however , with the technology have so far , only will be able to create another car such a flying car or car that can go under the water . this could not be the solution a the amount of car will be same a now or even more . it will be great improvement but would not help the problem of pollution by car . secondly , last twenty year there ha been dramatic difference on tranfer matter , di believe that twenty year is too short time to think whether amount of car will decrease . i strongly believe that one day it will ; however with the technology we have at the moment , can not solve this problem . in conclusion , we are having pollution problem because of increasing number of car such a air pollution , nose pollution . with the technology keep developing , one day amount of car will decrease or even disappear by using new way of trans . nevertheless , in my opinion , this can not take place in twenty year .
