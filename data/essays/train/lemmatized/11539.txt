there are some people think that understanding idea and concept are improtant , you can use the idea of concept to relate the other thing , but i disagree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in my opinion , to learn fact are more important in our life . first of all , learning fact can make better dicisions in our life . sometimes , idea or concept are just keypoints , we can gain some information from them , but we can not make good dicisions because of them . for example , when we decide to choose a career , we should defintely know what it is , what you will do . if you just know the concept , you may be confused , you can not seperate what is economic , what is finance , what is accounting . therefore , learn fact are more important and more useful in our life . in additional , learning fact can make u get high grade in the school . as our experience , we are usually confused about detail question in the test , sometimes we can not seperate the simlilar concept , this is becuse we just undetstand idea and concept , we do not actually understand fact . in the studying , if we can go futher after we studied concept , i think we can get high grade and more easily finish the test . in our life , sometimes we always just undertand idea and concept of the thing , we easily think it is enough , but in some case , becuse of our poor knowledge , we will feel bad and we will lose some chance , so if we have time , we should learn something deeply , at that time , you turely get that thing .
