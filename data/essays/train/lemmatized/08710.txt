i absolutely disagree with this statement . why should enjoying life be based on age ? sure , young child have a lot of fun playing around and laughing about simple thing and just enjoying mostly everything they do but i also know a lot of older people that still enjoy their life very much . a good example are my grandparent . they are almost 80 year old and are happier than ever . they had to start working really hard when they were teenager . both of them worked almost all the way up to their 65th birthday . they have 4 son together , so you can imagine that it cost a lot of time and work to raise the child . now , the son are adult and already have family themselves . my grandparent are retired now , so their hard work life is over and they can just enjoy life . their usual day includes long walk through the nature and spending a lot of time with friend and family . they have a nice hobby : bowling . every thuesday afternoon they meet with other people at the same age in a bowling center near their house and just enjoy bowling and talking to good friend . they often come over to my parent ' house on the weekend . sometimes the whole family , including all 4 son and all their grandchild meet there and we sit together and have coffee and cake . my grandparent have so much they enjoy . last yaer they even made a lifelong dream of them come true , they went on a vacation to the swiss alp . they spent 2 wonderful week there . they took tour along the mountain , had a picknick in between a very nice land scenery . after they came back and told u all about the trip we almost got a little jealous . they were so excited and now they are even planning to go back there next year . so you see older people enjoy life just a much a young people , maybe sometimes even more .
