i agree with the statement that people who try new thing and take risk are more successful than people who just stay on the level they are already on . in my opinion people who want to be successful should be creative and open for new thing . furthermore they should believe in themselves and should not get insecure , if other person do not agree with their opinion or way of proceeding . for instance , many big invention such a car or plane would n't exist this time , if there would not have been somebody who wa affected to new thing , had the will to research and to take the risk of failing . probably , when daimler invented the first car most people thought he would be crazy and did not support his plan . he had the risk to fail , but a we can see today it turned out a a big invention and he became famous . however , if people would n't be risky and open-minded the human nature would n't be on this level it is right now . the society need people who are interested in new thing to develop and to grow up . if we all would stay on the level which we are good in and do not increase our ability , we still would live in wooden house a century ago .
