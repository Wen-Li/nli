the understanding of idea and concept is one of the most important reason for education of youth people . i am strongly agreed with this statement so that all the fact have an origin in an idea . in the first place , the importance of understanding our history and fact doe not only depends on our knowledge of the fact , but also the comprehension of why all of the thing are and wa happening in our world . the world war ii wa the most cruelty war that humankind ha ever suffered a a result of million of victim in both part . beyond these atrocity there were awful idea of how to rule the world . furthermore , i can see the reason of bringing a country to the war a the united states did to that war . the us could see people have thier natural right which are inherited to human being such a freedom or religion . these are idea . second , we use idea and concept not only to find out fact , but also to learn about our future problem and fact . math is a science that you have to understand theory and concept to solve the problem . third and finally , i think idea and concept create a critical inspiration to the society , which make u better observer of the world . in this case , we should to recognise the root of poverty to improve this world and the idea and concept can bring these solution . in conclusion , i think the more idea and concept we understand , the better comprehension of world we have . it is more important to know the why than to know because and the same fact , because history can repeat the same idea
