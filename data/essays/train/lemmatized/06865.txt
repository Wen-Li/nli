i have a simple idea about this question , because there is not a subject more important than other . i think that a person must know many academic subject because it is a important for all life . for example in my school i study mainly lecterature , matematic and science . probably in my future life i will do not use the lecterature or the science but i will use more matematic because i want to do a architect . this doe not mean that i do not studi lecterature or science . it mean that , of this two material i can not know specific subject but it is quite a general knowledge . to difference , probably i will use more matematic in my future work and of this material i must know more specific subject . my idea is this , it is more important knowledge of many academic subject but it is not important ( maybe impossible ( know all of all in specific . it is important have a general know of all and know the specific material and aspect of own intrest . the specialize is a important aspect for the future work but it is impossible whitout a primary general knowledge . many material are correlated and more aspect are interrelated , so it is important have a general know of this . it is very erract think at general knowlwdge or at speific subject , both are important . in my specific , i like know many academic subject because i have many and different intrest . for example i like study botany and pop music . naturally i can not studi this in specific way but i try to do it . in conclusion i think that the peaple must know all in generic and some aspect in specific subject . the important is study very hard and
