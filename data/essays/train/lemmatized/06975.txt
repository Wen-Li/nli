i think this is an interesting statement . i can give a direct testimoniation of a succesful person that i konow very well and of whom i know how he work : this person is my father . mr.dario ( i love call him for name ) is in this moment the general directors of caripe bank , a bank tha is included in the bpi group . i think that to arrive at this level one person always have to take risk not only `` rather than only doing what he already know how to do well '' . and i tell this not only at working level , but at personal level too . i 'll explain this : we live in ravenna , a city of northern italy . now i 'm in barcelona for my erasmus experience but normally i sudy in milan that is far from ravenna . to do this work , my father have had tried a new type of life . every week , for 5 day a week , he go away from home and life by his own in pescara , the city where the center of the bank is located . the decision that ha cought my father , i think , is the most difficult choose that a man with a brillant career from one part and a good and lovely family from the other can take . the distant from pescara and ravenna is of 450 km but my father spends the maximum time that he can found at home . for maximum time i mean inly the week end but a total week end . to return in pescara he start on monday morning at five a.m. and than he work hard for five day to return at home . my became general director 2 year ago , the risk to lost the family wa great ( because the distance , the work , because during the week end the time to stay togeter is not much . .. ) but i can tell and confirm with happines that every week end my father return at home only for u and during all the week he is in our heart because for u is the most important person of the world . .. i think he ha won his bet but i hope , one day , i 'll come back to work near home .
