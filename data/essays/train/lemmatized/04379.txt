i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do for these reason : young people have alot of power which life need , yonge people have alot of time for enjoy in this life and older people have alot of problem that make him not enjoy in their life . first , young people have alot of power in this time . young people have a good health , a good and nice body and more they are more active . ali can to go to desney town and play there most dangeras game , but his grandfather can not . second , younge people have alot of time . they do not have alot of responsility like childrern and busness . researches say that more than 50 % of young time is for enjoying , but the olders have le 20 % of their time for enjoy . finally , old people have alot of problem that make him not enjoy in thier life . old people have alot of disease and child that make there life not intersting . in conclusion , the best time for the human is when he is young . young can do every thing . although we can not stop the time , we should enjoy in every minut in the young time .
