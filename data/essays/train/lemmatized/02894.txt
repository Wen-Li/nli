being old is often called a burden , but that is no true , to be old in the modern time is not a burden , it ha many great advantage . being experienced , having a secured financial situation are benefit besides having a lot of time . old people are more relaxed than young people in most situation . the fact that old people have experienced very much and especially a lot of not so nice thing , let them be very relaxed even in situation that are totally stressing young people out . for example a young person miss a very important test , a final exam . for the young person this is really hard to take because in his world taking a class one semester longer seems very long . for an old and ex person the fact of missing an exam would be hard too , but the old person know from experience that worse thing can happen an one semester would not seem so long afterall . in this situation it would be more enjoyable to be old . many old people have a secure financial situation . this relief older people from worrying about the financial future . worrying about the financial situation in the future is one point why many young people ca n't enjoy being young . old people do n't have to work any more . this give them time to travel very much . it is very enjoyable to go travelling all the time , many old people do that . for example my grandma travel the whole world , while i have to study . i think she enjoys her time more than i do . as a result , especially looking at my grandma . i can say that i do not agree with the given statement . in my opinion old peolple do n't enjoy life le than zoung people .
