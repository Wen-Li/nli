some people think young people should enjoy life more than older people . on the other hand , some people belive that older people should enjoy life more than younger people . in my view , i think the second view is that i like . because the following advantage will be supply . first of all , the older people have a lot of time to spend , for example , when the older people retired from their job , they can use it to other palce that do not delay their work . but if younger people do it , they must affect their job . for example , if older people want to beach , they can go at once . they have a lot of time to prepare the all thing , and they can use their time to slow drive . additionally , the older people have enough money . they do not worry the cost . the younger people should take care their future . so they must save . for instance , if young people do not save money , they can not affort the cost of house . they also lose their future . finally , if the younger people enjoy life specially , that will result they do not connect with their friend . that is very bad thing . for example , some young people make illeage thing because they want to enjoy life extremely . we should encouge the young people study more and more . according the above metioned , i think young people do not enjoy life more than older people . they should study more . when they are old , they can enjoy life more .
