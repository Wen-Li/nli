i did n't agree with the point of view that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . first reason is that i think travel is a very personal experience and that doe n't need many people come and finish with me . second reason is that the travel agency will bring me to a fixed place and fixed time to travel place that most people should look and that also mean i ca n't have enough time to take adventure . third reason is that most of the tour guide really just provide limit and small information from the tour text book . i will provide more detail about my point . the first reason i did n't like to join a travel group is that i think travel is a very personal experience that is a process of dialuate with myself . i will enjoy the singal travel experience that i can read , stay with the local resident and sit down to write when i meet what touch my heart a my wish . the second reason is that the travel agency always provide some limit place that cost them le money and limit the time for the travel spot . so i ca n't have some more adventure to deeper place , talk with more people , and take more detail on the place . that is very pity . more over , they will bring me to some boring shopping center that are always waste my time . the third reason is the most important part to me that is the toup gide are n't local resident or they are just provide too little information to me . some even ca n't give me more information except from the tour gide text book . to my point of view , i did n't agree with the point that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . because travel mean to me is more personal , more relax time to go and to touch the thing and to understand more about where are the culture difference . so fixed time and fixed place way of travel group is not just not my choice .
