people all over the world often discus , wheather young peoole spend enough time helping the community . i think that lot of young people are concernd about community and also hlep them a lot . first of all i think this already start in school . in every class the pupil elect one of them to be a speaker for the hole class . you have also pupil doing that for the complete school . so they learn early about being reposable for class mate and training their social skill , which is very useful for being a person who help others and so the community . but i also think that you can help community if you get yourself a good education . because you might help better , if you have a huge knowlege in managing think or organisation . so i a high education standard is a big help for comunity , if the people have better job they will be more likely to hlep than an unemployed person who think that it is the community fault that he ha no job . moreover ther are lot of young people envolved in different organisation . they help in sport club for example , by organize trainig session or they help planning activity for the member like camping or visiting pool or city . so they help to avoid that smaller child spend to much time by their own . morover i think young people also help community by doing their civil work . after finishing school the male person will be able to do social work instead of going to the army . so lot of job could not be paid to be done by professional trained employer so this people help that this work is done . lots of young people also participate in organisation a first aid or the free firework . so they help in their free time rescueing other people , which i think is very veluable to community . all in all i think there are lot of young people who care about and help communitiy , but there are also some who do not care , which is often see by more people so that they think all young people are that way .
