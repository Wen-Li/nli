successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i agree with the statement . sucessful people always try new thing if they take risk . pesonally , they do n't care about risk and they are sick of their boring life , i suppose . among many reason , the most important reason is that successful people have an ambitious in their mind . they always try to obtain their new way . because they want to be the first one . they think , being best is more important than doing best . to be the first is a big achievement . additionally , they need strengthen their own company if they have it . it is not easy to make more strengthen it . but they know how to manage their own money and how to manage people . because they are successful people already . to sum up , i would like say that sucessful people have an ambitious .
