we live in the world that feature highly developed technology , fast life style , and widely spread network of internet . i firmly believe this phenomenon are forced to have an influence on our life continueously . in this reason , i predict that there will be fewer car in the future . first of all , the development of internet will be responsible for declinge in the number of car . we do not need to move one place to another in order to meet our friend , get some information neccessary for out work , read the paper that show what happens today . all we have to do is click search bar or surf the internet . it 'll probably be led to the reduction in movment using transportation system , especially riding a car for the period of time . on the other hand , we can not miss the possibility to meet new type of transportation method . for a long time , we have depend on the car that is very comfortable and familiar with u . however , riding a car ha weakness at many espects . as many highway are crowded with many car , they cause a lot of problem . for example , it can pollute the air we breathe every day and many unexpected accident , which , to some extent , make u injured and dangered . because it ha many unconveniences for u , advanced technology is going to help u to live happily without worrying about environmental element or accident . in short , i agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . internet will make u deal with almost every our work at home and the alternative to the car will apprear . in the hope of new transportation system , we can concentrate on our present work . i
