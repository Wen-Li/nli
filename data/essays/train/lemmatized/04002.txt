i agree with the statement , partly . broad knowledge of many academic subject is great , but focus on a specific subject is also very good . i think it depends on your age and your position in the company . when we are in the middle school , it is better to have broad knowledge . a teenager do n't know exactly what they want . they may be eager to become a famous singer in the moring , and carzy about the idea of being a scientist in the midnight because of a sweet dream . and everyone 's interest may change in the long run . when i loved the computer game in my 14 year old , i wanted to be a game designer . in every dream of mine , i studied computer science in a famous high school . i attained the blizzard entertainmet company ( the most famous company which present pc-games ) . i wa the only focus in the e3 ( the greatest pc-games conference ) . but now , i lost my interest in pc-games . being a doctor is more attrative to me . if i put all my passion on computer and gave up my schoolwork , no doubt i wa regrating for that . but when we are in univercities , we should choose a subject to study . today , no one can handle all knowledge . everybody should know something deeply and corporate with others . as old chinese saying go : `` you know everything , you know nothing . '' if you do n't have your specific subject , you will find no job . because everything you can do , there are many people who can do it better than you . not only your age , your position in the company also determines whether you should have broad knowledge or specific subject . if you are the manager , you should know something about economics , administration , and the product you provide . but if you are a staff , you should care about what exactly the company want you to do . so we can get a conclusion : both board knowledge and specific subject is needed , just thinking about which is better for you .
