i can not to be in disagree with these word . modern people need the car . we use the car for many region . we need it for the job and intertainment , for the holiday and for all thing of our life . we can make an important consideration : the life is change , the world is change and it 's changing , in the modern life we need to move and go around always . also the tecnology is changed , and all people can buy a car , now . is 's more chap then ten year ago . if in twenty year there will be fewer car , it will be an important problem for the world , for the global and for the people . for use and drive a car we need way and park . but today there is n't this . the administrator know this problem but is difficult to risolv it . we can say that we can not live without car . it 's strange , but it 's really . the life run , and you have to run behind it . today have a car is very important , and you ca n't live without it . for example , i live in a littel town near milan , and if i have n't the car i can not come to work or to study in milano , because the train is ever on late , and there is n't other way . when i wa young i do n't need the car because i can enterteiment myself in my town with my friend , but today young peaple have diffren necessery , and they want have ever the car .
