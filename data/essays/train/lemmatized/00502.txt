yes , i agree with this idea . now a day , too many car are running in the raod , in the city , every where . i have read in the newspaper with the research , 70percent of the family ha thiere own car , and many of them in a family ha the average car of two . the problem here is , the car are polluting the air , and too many car are leading u to traffic . many people are stressed with this problem also . so the people here in korea recently started riding bus or subway going to work and home . but still , many car . not only the car are polluting , but the soap and trash . . etc . when i walk around , i even can smell the bad gas on the air , and the part , it is getting worse . so many scientist and people are searching and trying to reduce the pollution . and the fasted way to lessen is by riding bus or subway . we surely have to do something about this , if we love our country . let 's say for example , like advertising alot , teaching our kind , and leaving the car often at house parking lot , riding with neigh if we want to live in a beautiful country , ofcourse we have to take good care of our home place also . so no matter what the reason is , we have to start a soon a possible . by twenty year from now , i agree that there will be fewer car . changing few habby 's will save our world .
