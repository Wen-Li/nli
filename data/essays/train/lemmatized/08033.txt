most advertisement make product better than they really are is a strong statement that give quite a pessimistic view on marketing in general . different company us advertise product in different way some of which may seem illecit , subliminal message , but the purpose of advertisement is not always to illustrate the quality of a product , but it 's importance in our daily life . it is in the company greatest interest to glorify their product , but it is also in their interest to make sure that the product actually work . it is obvious that an advertised product will work better then the actual product because there are factor affecting the product that may cause malfunctionings . the way an advertise is made , the component of the product and the user cautiond about the product will give different result on the functioning of the product . advertisements are done in many way : writing , visually , subcontiously , and on a auditory level . visual advertisement are presented to u by video and fotografical commercial in which the product is in it best condition , it is new and a time is presented a a digital object something unreal , basically a drawing . advertising through wtiring may be risky in that the opinion may differ . on a subconsciouse level we will accept the commercial itself and find it great so it is u that find advertisement better than the product . again the condition of a product on an advertisement are perfect while one might find malfunction in the product a it may have been dameged by time , transport and our misuse of it . all component of the product are key factor in the functioning of the product a new product will always be better than an old one . man error is a major cause in one agreement in the statement . what our brain make u believe may differ what we experience and believe . concluding , it is not the advertisement that make product look better but it our way of thinking that prevents u from seeing the true reason why advertised product are better than owned product .
