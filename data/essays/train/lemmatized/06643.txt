most advertisement make product seem better than they really are , i am agree this stamente . in my expericences , i bouth product that seem to be --- really good , but threre not , the kind the publicity seems to look to good , . one example the this is the hambuger , when they advertice look so delicios , and when you tested is not to good . one another exaples is the car the advertise with a lot --- speed this right , but you can not use this speed in the regular time , for my is better when adverse about the gas . an another example the service advertise , sometimes you went to company to have a service , and you not have the quality the service that you pay . in conclusion the advertisement play a big situation to sell product in the market .
