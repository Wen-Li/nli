one need to spend at least few hour to help their community , which ultimately help in increasing the living standard . i agree with the statment that young people are not spending enough time to help their community . why i am holding that opinion is because of these reason . first younger people are now more concentrating on their study , which is mandatory in the modern life . because of the cut throat competition in the modern world , they need to be good in their course , obviously it mean that they have to spend more time on their course . so they have le chance of concentrating on the community welfare . second younger generation people are more attracted towards fashion , which is ruling the campus now a day . for that they are spending a lot of time on clothes and jewellery . it one of the reason why they are not involving in the community work . third younger people are more interested in video game and other common sport . because sport give more fun , which might be one of the reason . why this phenomenon is happening because they are not feeling responsible for the community welfare . it happened in my case when i wa studying i am not at all intersted in community work , all the time i spent on my university work and sport . that time i am not aware of the community benefit . slowly i realised the benefit of the community work in improving the living standard . in short , younger people are not spending time on community welfare , but by the guidance they will know the importance .
