i agree with the given statement . i think it is not only important to understand the idea but also their interaction and relationship with each other . usually , fact like formula in economics and date in history are something that one can use to get a good grade in a test or exam , but in the real world , that start a soon a a student leaf the university , no one will care if you can calculate a fictional unemployment rate in a fictional economy or not . it is more important to understand how unemployment develops , what factor influence it , and how it can be influenced by government . and it is also more important to understand the development from world war i to world war ii than to know on what exact day the conference of munich took place . ideas and concept give a student a toolset of how to approach a problem , how to think . an idea is open to change , it can be transformed , developed and adjusted to the situation in which it is needed , why a formula or a fact is only relevant under special , given circumstance . of course it is important to know example , from different time , from different country , so one can compare reason and development line , but this doe not include number . in a university lecture one might hear about the great depression - but it doe not make a difference for the understanding if there were 10 or 11 percent of unemployment , it is more important how it wa caused . the only exception in my opinion is in the field of science - physic , chemistry or medicine , where the difference between one or two degree of body temperature for example can lead to totally different action and outcome . students need to learn to think by themselves , develop their idea and find argument , for or against a theory , they need to learn to judge a situation to act appropriatly , and they will not get to that by learning number by heart .
