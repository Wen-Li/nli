i agree with the idea that is better to develop knowlegde in several subject instead of specializing in one only . the first reason to believe it is related to the impact of knowledge on the individual . an extensive knowledge of a single subject confines a human being to it academic subject and doe n't evolve it personality at large . on the contrary , the study of several subject expands the limit of a person 's undestanding of life a a whole . a second reason , focusing on the scholarly impact of knowledge diversification , is that it offer the opportunity of a comparative approach . an academic who is educated in several different subject will be able to identify interesting connection between distant discipline , thus opening the way to new approach . this is true not only for the academic world . any person who expnds her/his area of knowledge increase her/his possibility to be successful in life . a third reason to prefer diversificationi is that it can prevent interest from drying up . when a person concentrate for a long period on a single subject , he/she is exposed to the risk of losing dedication or flatly identifying with a specific point of view . dealing with different subject , instead , generates a relativistic approach that help creativity and encourages new point of view . a clear example of how culture can positively expand in a single human being is offered by some renassaince intellectual . a man like leonardo da vinci , for example , could with it knowledge embrace almost any subject known of the time . even if in the present day ' reality such case are not possible anymore because of the incommensurate expansion of human study , the case of leonardo still represent a valid example of how a multidisciplinary approach to knowledge can boost human brain power . in conclusion , even if a few men can aspire to reach the erudition of leonardo , the argument above effectively clarify how divesrification of knowledge can benefit intellectual work .
