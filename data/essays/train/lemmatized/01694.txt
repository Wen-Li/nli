i disagree that understanding idea and concept are more important than it is to learn fact . with this a do not mean that understanding idea and concept are useless , of course you need them for everything you do , like in your personal life , in your work , etc . the point that i think that is more important learning the fact it is because you are actually living in real life the problem . understanding idea may give the basis for the problem but many time when you are in the real situation it is not like they taught u it would be . like for an example when you are studying in the college , they teach how the company work , they give you all the idea and concept of what you are suppose to do in such situation , and many tool to resolve many problem in your professional life . but this is no even close of what actually happens in real life . when you graduate and finish school and a company hire you , this a different story . the problem are much bigger and stressing than the one you study . for resolving this problem you have to implement all the knowledge you have study . the fact give you a wider vision of what is happening around the world . i think that studying fact give you the knowledge and the experience to face the problem in you professional life . experience is one of the most importante attribute that a persona can have when you are looking for a job . this will help you to resolve the problem in a way a lot easier than your collegues and it could be a value that you your superior would evaluate like a principle asset . in conclusion a think that learning fact are much more important than unsterstanding idea and concept , of course not making the second one le important .
