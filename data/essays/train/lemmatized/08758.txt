i think that the most successful people in the wourld are those who keep trying new thing and taking risk . i think that because of three reason . the first reason is that this kind of people , a i think learn new thing in their life because they do not give up easily ; so they always try to dicover new thing and ther is a famous speech saying that people who fail will finally succeed but those who are lazy and do not try something new or give up easil will never learn . the second reason supporting my opinion is that the people who always keep trying new thing have more opportunity and are more active or energetic than those who are satisfied with what they only know ; in other word the first group , for example may improve their financial situation better or they may invent something new that is very useful for our life . let u say that the first group of people are nventors and the lazy people are receivors . the third thing or reason is that the persevering people may easily adapt with new situation other than others , for example , a think , if somebody of the first group travel to another country , he will adapt a quick a he can because he like new thing in general . with regard to lazy person , a i like to call them , i know some person of this kind who could not stay even for a month living alone in a new country when they travelled abroad and they are always failure . what i want to confirm here is that any person who try new thing will finally get it passed even if the number of failure he may commit , while anyone who is lazy and doe not want to learn anything new will stay where he is and , in my opinion , he is always a failure and something that is excessive to this life .
