at the school or at the university , we often have to learn thing , and we are judged upon this capacity . however i think that it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . first of all , an automatic learning of event , date , or fact , is only the proof of a good capacity to memorise . .. but to my mind it doe not reveal an aptitude to solve a problem or to understand a situation . even if having a good memory is a quality , it ca n't be sufficient . then , it is clear that understanding concept is a good way to help the student structuring their idea . unless understanding an event , it will be very difficult to memorise it ! how to understand a situation or a problem without knowing how it function ? learning fact without understanding them would be the revelation of a lack of intelligence . moreover , the aim of the university is to prepare the student to have a job in their future life , in which they will probably need capacity of understanding and reacting in front of a situation more than pure memory . it is clear that in all work you need capacity of memory , but to understand the situation and to act in consequence is much more useful . finally , we can say that if learning fact is really the basis of the education , in my opinion it is not sufficient , and to understand what we learn is the more important . we need to know concept and reasonments to structure our thinking . i think that the university and the school should make an effort to teach u how to think by ourselves , more than to teach u event , date , that we will forget .
