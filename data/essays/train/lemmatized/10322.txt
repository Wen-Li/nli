people are frequently faced some difficult situation . when they meet these circumstance , they act differently . some are trying to find other new way and others are not . i prefer the the first rather than other . i believe this is the way to find better life in my life . first , most of successful people willingly took risk . for instance , bill gate who is the millonaire in the world accepted the new situation . he wa a normal student in the university like other student but suddenly changed his way to find new one which other people did n't care about it . what if he did n't do at that time , we could n't use the computer personally so quickly . second , the condition we live in now wa n't able to developed without taking risker . imagine , everybody avoid taking risk and stay where they are . they never think which is needed to live better life . they are not usually achivement and outgoing people . success never come to people who do n't seek to find it . third , taking riskers are always moving . as soon a they are accustomed to deal thing , they started to find others . it 's not easy to begin with a new one . because it requires much attention from them . but it is worthy to spend time on the new one even if it give nothing . after failing , they realized something from them . and it help to other step . i like the proverb that failing is the mother of success . without this mind , successful people can not strive in the world . i would like to be a one of the take riskers . taking risk need to have challege mind but it will bring me a successful life .
