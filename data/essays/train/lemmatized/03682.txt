in a student ' life , good learning is by studying from part to whole . this mean that a student can do better if his basic knowledge of understanding is good . learning fact is a part of study but one need to deep knowledge to grasp fact and this come by understanding idea and concept . for example , a biology student who is doing a research in the field of microrganisms can go ahead with his research only if he ha the basic idea of microorganism and their behaivour . by only learning fact , he can not reach a final decision . to have his finding more a solid basis , he need to have a strong foothold in microorganic study . similar factor work with student who have just joined school or the one who are in the process of a learning new subject . for instance , a mathematics student can do his high level arithmetic and algebra only if his lower level math skill are developed . furthermore , these skill become an inherent quality when he know how to derive at a formula . although learning a formula will make him work out easy problem but he will get stuck in the major issue . in this sequence we can also come to a solution that understanding thing is the key to success than merely knowing fact . a fact may help you out in the short run . it will not pave your path to reach your goal . a clear understanding develops interest in student to pursue their future in an innovative field of any branch instead of working on the set pattern by their ancestor . these criterion will also lead the world towards new technology and science that are still undiscovered . considering all the above fact i completely disagree to the fact that it is important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to lern fact .
