i agree with the point that is successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do a well . firstly , the people who like to explore can learn more about something news than do the old thing or repite same thing people . though the explore thing , you can find the thing which you never have been seen or do it , and you will love to the world . because you find something which you do n't knew . it called knowledge . yeah , the world is wonderful , if you do not believe that , the only thing you lost is your heart . it mean you have n't bold . secondly , there wa impossible that the people who know everything . people is not god , and god will not help the man who would not do anything . you maybe know one thing or few thing more than others , others may know others thing than you in truthly . people learned thing from book , tvs , newspaper , computer , etc . so the knowledge are limit thing . you can though you explore eye , your hot heart , your heathly body , to try , to find , to do the thing which is fine , is worth to do . last but not least , people do the thing and get successful is not easy thing . you must try you best to do this . you do n't sit a nice place and wish i could be successful . everyone wish himself or herself is a successful man or woman . if you are just think about it , and not pay your action , your time , your power , it could become unsuccessful . the man is impossible got know everything , if there is a man who know everything , it must be from his expriense . where can we get from ? yap , try your best to try new thing , form it , you will be grow up . let u try .
