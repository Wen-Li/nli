i agree with the statement that advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are . in today 's world medium play a very important role . and this age of medium is widely governed by advertisement . adverisement ha become very important medium between consumer and producer . so people are greatly influenced by advertisement . each producer try to impress people by it own tactic . in this bid to influence people they generally show many false point about their product . and people get in the trap of the company . with the development of commercialization advertisement are also gaining their importance . now people are becoming more convinced by advertisement they see on television and newspaper . these company are spending great deal of money in advertisement . they rarely think of spending the money in improving the quality of their product . as these company are also aware that advertisement are becoming very crucial in the sale of their product . today their is great competition in the market . we can see number of product for same purpose . whenever a new product is lauched it is made familiar to people through advertisement . initially company offer some discount to their product to encourage people to buy their product . and each advertisement try to show that is the best available product in the market . people are greatly attracted by these advertisement . advertisements are generally false image of the product that company try to bring before people . due to increased competition and to get maximum sale of their product company show the point in their product whch are not true . at end i will like to conclude that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
