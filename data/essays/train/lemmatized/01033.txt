probably in twenty year there will be fewer car than there are today and this will be due to different reason . in fact there are already many problem for the traffic end for polluted air and it ' s easy that it will be something to resolv this problem . there will be many more pubblic way to go aroun than today . modern car need petrol wich is not an infinite source and it 's easy to think that there will be different kind of work so that people will not need a car a much a today . first a modern problem are the poluted air and the traffic , wich is too caotic . so it ' s easy to think that scientist are trying to resolve these problem . a possible solution is to make something to have car that will not have such a bad effect to the air a it is today . but to resolve both the problem of traffic and air there will be many more bus or train . in fact today there are so many car around iven because there are not enough pubblic bus or train , so it 's necessary to have a car to go to work or to every other place . then a big problem of car is that they need petrol to go on . but petrol is not an infinite source so in the future there will be le petrol than the one necessary for the great number of car . it mean that petrol will cost too much till it will be too expansive for many people , that will decide to use other way to go around instead of car . in addition new tecnologhyes are developping new kind of work , in fact many people will work from their own house using their computer and internet . so they will not need to go to work every day like they usually do now , and they will not need to have many car in each family to go to work in different place . so the fact that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today will be better for the condition of the air and for ourselves too . and it will be easyer to go around spending le money than today
