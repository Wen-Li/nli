i can see both advantage and disadvantage to try new thing and take risk for being successful . you can whether choose stability and use traditional way and avoid risk or try new way and take risk for being successful . i definetely believe that people should try new thing and take risk for being succesful . if you do everything with a routine that mean you know the result . for example if a farmer use traditional way for agriculture , he can guess how much crop he will get . he can avoid risk by doing that . but it is not a creative way and it is obvious that he wo n't be successful . he will get a same amount crop a next year . the point i am trying to make is , that is not a vakid way for being a suscussful person . on the other hand he could try different way in order to get much crop which mean taking risk for success . in my opinion , successful people try new thing and take risk . for instance , if the farmer try a new agriculturel way which is not experienced before he can get a different amount of crop . he could get whether '' le or much '' but the point is he can be successful by taking that risk . i already know that lot of successful people in business area tried new thing and figure out new way . that is the main reason of their success . for instance a very well known newspaper owner wa just a writer in a newspaper . he decided take risk , he resinsged and established a local newspaper and then he made it success . and we all know that newspaper owner today . to sum up , i always experienced that successful people take risk . they try new way instead of only doing what they already know . they take risk for being successful .
