i disagree that in twenty year there will be fewre car in use that there are today . first , the another transportation that will replace the car ' role have little chance because of effectiveness . througe many year , car have been used vary widely . and that mean another devicec to support car is prevail . so , to make this comfortable situation people have investigated many money . therefore another vehicle is hardly to replace . in same notion , if that substitutive transportation can replace that car , it 's not easy to make comfortable to use . second , although nowadays is called ` global world ' , car is useful when peopel have to go a short distance . because i mentioned , nowadyas road is very common so it 's very convenience to move short distance . altough now is called global world , peopel rarely go to abroad by comparison with peopel use car to go social region . third , people 's adjecent . for many year people have used car . for that reason , people is very familer with car . so i 'm doubt that people will try to adjust to another thing dispite of car 's comvinence . fourth , nowadays oil is very expensive . and addition , the alternative fuel is not invented that sustain world wide demand . so the transportation that will use same fuel , it 's hard to reign the car . although another fuel will be invented , it 's price will high because of it 's inovative right . in conclusion , car 's efficiency , more time to use , adjunct , tangible , it 's hard car to be reduced in twenty year .
