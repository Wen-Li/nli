young people enjoy life more than old people because they don t have health problem a many a old people do . while we are getting old we loose most of our ability like ; hearing , seeing far or close object , if we are unlucky , walking and many like these . most of the old people that we know take medicine in order to regulate the ordinary and normal body condition for example ; my grandmother take pill in order to regulate her heart beat and grandfather of mine take medication to avoid his blood presure increase abnormaly . i hear their complains about these problem every single day . most of the time , i think the only thing that can be spoken to an old person is heath problem or medicine . after getting retired , seeing their childrens weedings , having decreased on the ability that they used to have , the thing they expect from their own life becomes just dieing in peace , and i think this is the most significant idea of many old people . i witneesed it from my grandparent and their friend who are over 60 year old . on the other hand , i also know a lot of young people who ha no health problem and who are very happy with their life . enjoying the life despite some other problem which old people don t have after their retirement a ; earning money , affording a good life , hard work condition , is still possible for them because they don t have to worry abour their health . most of the young friend i know care about their life in order not to be like their parent , complaining all the time about doctor or the que at the hospital . they go to sport center , take long holiday , travel to other country , go to picnic , try different type of sport , becomes a member of a club . .. so they also consider that not only being young , but also staying healthy is necessary . in my opion , young people who know how to enjoy life and keep their health a long a possible , accomplishs to enjoy life more than unhealthy old people do .
