people hold different opinion of whether or not young people enjoy life more that older people do . one may claim that young people can enjoy life more since they have more energy . however , i will argue that people can enjoy life equally , both the young and the elder . the first reason in support of my view is that people have equal right in term of enjoying life . nowadays , numerous game and activity tends to become suitable to people at any age . traveling would be a perfect example to prove my argument . more and more travel agency provide different trip and vacation regarding to the difference of age . elder people can join and group for senior , likewise , youngster can participate one designed for their age . second of all , people enjoy life in the same level although they may do activity in different way . the acitivities that young people like to do , such a video game or extreme sport , the senior may not enjoy doing . instead , they may like prefer doing other thing , like gardening or cooking . however , there is no definition that tell people which game are more fascinating or which activity are tedious . when it come to how to enjoy life , it more likely to depend on different people . last but not least , some people may argue that the people are more energitic to do more activity . in my point of view , due to the amazing development of modern medicine and health care , the elder are in better healthy condition which provide them to enjoy some highly active sport a well . the man , who is in his seventy , go to swim everyday in the morning . i believe some young people even can not keep this everyday routin . the young may not have interest on it , or they even do n't have sufficient time to do it a some older people . in conclusion , i am highly convinced that both the young and the olders enjoy life equally since they have the same right , although they may enjoy life by participating different activity . besides , the contribution of the medical science on senior health also increase the opportunies to do more activity for them
