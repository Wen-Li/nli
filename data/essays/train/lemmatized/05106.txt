the statement that young people have a greater ability to enjoy life than older people clearly is an issue worthy of discussion . in the following essay i try to give example supporting and opposing this fact . in the beginning of this short passage it is necessary to state what can indicate enjoying one life . the most intuitive point are of course the amount of time spent on activity , which bring fun to an individual . examples for this can be sport , cultural activity such a theater or visiting the movie theater , social activity such a meeting with friend or visit in club , bar or disco . the actual amount of time spent on each activity clearly count toward the young people . yet it should not receive much attention , since growing age come along with growing responsibility . we shall therefore try to acknowledge the subjective feeling of fun deriving from each activity for the individual . when it come to sport , a difference between old and young people is not clearly distinguisable without thorough research , which can not be conducted at this point . most older people lie great emphasis on sport in order to stay healthy or free their mind by physical challenge . one could argue , that young people are taking the particular sport to a higher level , but this clearly doe not support the idea of a greater enjoing . every sport is enjoyable for the conducting individual , even if it is being practised at a very low level . focusing on the cultural activity , a general viewpoint is necessary . in general the age of the individual determines it taste . therefore the activity chosen are highly dependent on a individual age . again the type of activity chosen can not determine whether one individual receives a higher reward in term of fun from it choice , than the other individual doe from the other choice . the third category stated above indicates the greatest difference between age group . it is clearly observable and commonly known , that from a certain age onwards le emphasis is being laid upon going out a night and visiting bar , club or disco with friend . from a younger point of view this could be seen a a lack of fun in one life . to conclude this paragraph the difference in behavior between old and young people are clearly visible . yet this observation is lacking evidence that young people actually enjoy life more than older people . thus this statement can not be backed by thorough reasoning . the difference in behavior do not indicate more fun in life on one or the other side . yet the positive correlation between age and responsibility could make it harder for older people to conduct fun activity .
