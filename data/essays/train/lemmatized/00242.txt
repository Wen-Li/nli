i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . both young people and old people can enjoy the life , but young people can enjoy life more than the old one . everyone start his life a a child , then he gradually start the young people life . most of young people miss thier childhood life . they are sure that they can not enjoy life a they were doing in their childhood . when they are young they have more responsibality in life . however , at this time , a normal , they have more power and more ability to do work . they have the power and improved mind that can help them to do more and more fun . for example , they can do car racing , mountain climbing , sky diving . .. and much more which other age people can not do . old people are more likely like child . at that age they need help aproximatly a the child need . they became more depandent again . they can not do a much work a they can before . they no more have the power they were had , nor in their childhood not in their young day . they may have fun , but they get tired more quick and need more time to rest . enjoying life need power , endurance , indepandent , strenght , activity and much thing that older people do not have or have but in le level than young people have . for more clearifying , when we take dance a an example , can old people dance a good a young people ? or can they enjoy sex a young people do ? can they laugh a young people do ? can they do advantures a young people do ? and keep going ! in conclusion , i think that young people can enjoy life more than old people . because of what i said before and also because young people can be more excited and more active than old people .
