the idea of advertisement is to help the company to sell more product . while competing with other company , company tend to make their product look better in their advertisement . i agree the fact that most advertisement make product look much better than they really are , but i do n't disagree with the way company do it . the same a a movie preview , the director always want to show the most exciting part of the movie . companies tend to skip the inconviency and disadventige of their product . instead , they always show the best of their product . sometimes , the company will use special editing and filming skill to make their product look even better . for example , when the new i-pod nano first came out in the comercial , people were amazed by it pretty disign and how small it wa . however , buyer soon realized that the i-pod nano wa very easy to be scrached . moreover , the i-pod nano ha a very small menmory compare to other i-pods . the funny thing is that i bought a i-pod nano right after i saw the comertial . of course , the nano wa not a exciting a the one in comertial , but it wa not much worse . however , i wa really angry when i saw the first scrach mark on my i-pod nano . in now day , since people are living in a material word , there are many product are meant to make our life better , happier , but we do n't neccesarry need them in our dayly life such a a i-pod , cable tv , computer , fancy clothing , and more . because of these product are not neccesarry for our life , company have to make people want to buy them and do not expect a stable market without having any advertisement . of course , since advertisement are the only way people will know these product , company try to make them look a good a possible . therefore , most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are .
