almost everybody hate change . a lot of people want to stay where they are because they believe they are satisfied with what they have and are doing right now . however many case in the history have shown u that the people with open mind and people who are not afraid of new thing have always defeated old styled and conventional people . these are few thing why the people who try new thing and risk their position win in the end . most importantly , your environment doe n't always stay the same . the society keep on changing . sometimes it is changed by the creative invention like car or the internet . successful people always sensed this change in the society and seized the chance . for example , who could have thought that everybody would have personal computer in almost every house about 30 year ago ? however , bill gates knew the world would change . he took the risk of dropping out of school and establishing his own company that produce software and finally achieved success . secondly , nobody know what they are really good at or are interested in until they try new thing . taking the chance to really find your talent is important . successful people have n't always been successful . after many failure , they finally found their talent and could at last be successful . some might be doing all right because they have been doing the same kind of job over and over again . however , if they just tried something more , they could have found their talent and be more successful . one should n't always fear failing and taking the risk . when you fall down , you could always stand up and run for the success all over again . when you just do what you are currently doing and never seize the chance , you might earn your living . however , to succeed , i strongly think that one should always look for new thing .
