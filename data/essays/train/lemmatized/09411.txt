to say that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' is a lot like saying that someone should be good in everything but be perfect in nothing . does that make any sen ? everyone should have something they wish to know better . .. that 's why we all have different job . i think we can find a perfect example of having to really know something in particular , in nipponic society . japan is famous for their expert and we have been trying to copy their way of studying for decade . does the fact that they know more about one subject in particular , make them le smarter than people who know something about everything ? i think not . of course , having a good cultural background is important , but a long a we follow our desire and believe in the thing we do , than there 's nothing wrong about neglecting other subject . obviously , this doe not apply in an academic enviorment . a long a we are in school , we must study every required subject , but once that 's over , we should be free to expand our own knoledge in the field we prefer . if we all knew the same thing , we could never teach each other anything !
