i think that it will effectively have fewer car in use in the future than we can meet today . i feel this way because i believe that many factor will make u to let our car at home . from ourselves , from the nature , but also from the state . first , i consider that an auto pollutes a lot and if we continue to pollute our world , like we have already done through the ozone hole for exemple , we wo n't be able tu live on earth without bad changements . that 's why i think that people will do something from themselves in order to help the nature staying good for u . they will for exemple prefer to walk because they will understand that if everyone make something , it wo n't have little signal . another reason i believe that thre will be fewer car in twenty year it that the state of al country will do something against car like they begin to do nowadays . for exemple the day without car . furthermore , we are seeing that more and more way to drive bike or to take bus an underground are built in order to make people let their car at home . and i think that if the state do something , the population will have to use te way . and then , the reason i would like to emphasize is the fact that it will have a lack of petrol on the earth and the humankind will have to find another type of thing to move such a we have already showed ( underground for exemple ) . so , if even the nature doe n't give much power for the car anymore we will have to reduce our use of car . as i have stated , i believe that many way from ourselves , from the state and most important from the nature make u to use not so often . it will continue in the future that 's why i tink there will be fewer car in use in 20 year
