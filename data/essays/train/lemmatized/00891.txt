this world we live in ha always managed to find it way of a change such a what we have today : the common usage of car every where . to be honest i would never suspect that there will be a fewer number of car ever , because the world isnt made to help people find another mean of transportation . unless mankind succesfully achieves the prospect of spaceship or in other word floating car , then there will be absoloutly no dought that i will be thinking differently . what im saying is that it will take a much longer period of time for mankind to move on and give up on the car we use , probably allot more than a hundred year if not more . ofcourse im hoping that a new type of transportation mean would be achieved because car can be such a bother , for example car accident and parking and most importantly car oil or fuel . our world preservation are dying and it resorces are vanishing into thin air , and why do you think that is , just because we want to drive our car . im sure it mankind need for survival but that doesnt make it any le harmful towards nature . in twenty year we will have lot of new idea and invention thats for sure but we are going to face an absoloutly big problem with the anormous number of car being used and produced , the way i see it is that if we go on like this we might not manage to last for long . i think that the car industry is at it peak these day i mean how much better can car get to be they already managed to create built in facility in car , some people can live comfortably in a car . cars are an amazing invention but it can be a double edged weapon if the number encreases through the next two decade .
