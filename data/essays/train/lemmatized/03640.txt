studens often have a choice to made arrived at a certain point of their study . on one hand they can choose to make general studying on many subject , and on the othe , r to choose to specialize themselve in one specific subject . what argument can help student in their choice . in other word , what infer each choice ? i will discus both advantage and disavantages of each . to begin , specialisation doe not aloud numerous knowledge but these are quite precise and more detailed . specialization is closer to a profesional aspect of the working world . but getting specialize in one subject restreint evolution later a the student doe not know many thing about other subject . for example you have a small choice of career and sector when you have made medecine study a it is a specialized study . but for people who know what they wand , what they like and what they do not . they will choose for sure a specialisation , avoiding to learn subject they do not get interested in . on the contrary , having broad knowlegde of many acaddemic subject imply to have multiple ability . it aloud evolution in a future career a you know thing about diverse subject . you can change sector of activity more easily . broad knowlegdes show a capacity of adaptabilty a you are more open minded . however the sum of many knowledge can not be enought if these are too general . for me , a i am studying at a business school , i have made the choice of having a broad knowlegdes of many academic subject . that choice aloud me to learn abour diverse subject . it permit me to get more interested by other extra academic subject a i am used to look for diversity .
