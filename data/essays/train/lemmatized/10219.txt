in this writting , i am going to discus an important issue that most of community faced . the issue is that `` young people nowaday do not give enough time to helping their communitiea '' . this problem occure from different reason . one strong reson of this problem is that the new developement of technology that take young people time . for example the internet which recover the essential thing of a young people and satisfying their need a young people always concern of how i can happy . most of young people feel happy with their friend a the internet provide them to be with their friend all the time by using the massenger . another point is that a we hear in qatar , the education develope alot . the result of this development the albayan complex school and the independence school which depend mostly on english languge . to study the english languge in some subject create some coflict in young people a they do not used to take . this may encourage them to work hard and take english languge course to improve themselves in english and cope with the development . these take time , so it will not enable young people to be effective and helpful in the community . finally , young people noeaday do not give enough time to helping their communties , because of the pressurs of development and how i can satisfy myselt and be the best .
