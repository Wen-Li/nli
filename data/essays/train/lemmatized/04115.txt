the world is changing from day to day at a very fast pace . form the time when man used nothing but his foot to travel he ha reached a stage where he cover the same distance that he could before in a much smaller time . technical advancement and man 's thirst for more knowledge made these thing possible . well , 20 year back from now in my country people used bullock cart , horse and man-pulled transport more than car . so , chance are fair that 20 year from now man will use fewer car for he might find a better alternative to it !! with this note i would like to agree with the fact that 20 year from now , there will be le car on the road . in today era there are already too many car on the road flooding every nook and corner of the city and the outside of the city with equal intensity . the mode of transport that wa believed to be the fastest till yeaterday had become the cause for the delay in most people travel schedule . why ? .. why not ? how many time have we come across situation when we start really early from home to meet someone or to keep up an appointment but , to our vain we find a road full of car waiting for u to give them company . in any case even if the first hurdle is cleared we get to face another hurdle ` the red light signal ' and before you realise you are already too late to keep up your appointment . this problem is faced by most of u . to overcome this , the upperclass people prefer to travel by a private jet of a helicopter rather than taking a road . while today it might be a transport of the higher class , 20 year is a long period to bring down the cost of air journey considerably , so much so that even middle class will be able to afford it . resulting in fewer car on the road . the second reason for the contribution of le number of car on the road could be the scarcity of natural resource . while we all know how much petrol and desel is being burnt up every day in fuelling billion of car all around the world , while the resource are very le . it could be firmly anticipated that after 20 year there might not be much fuel left to ignite all the car . the country might take charge of the whole resource and use it only for the country 's experimentation and space reasearch . the country would then encourage it people to use the publich transport such a bus and tram which would require considerably le amount of fuel expenditure . it might also emphasize on electric-rail travel . this would accounting for fewer car on the road . the third reason might be the spreading awarness of pollution among the youth . the youth of today is the future power . it is seen that the child of today are very understanding and more inclined to understanding their environment and problem connecting to them . there is spreading awareness among the youth about living in a better place while leaving enough resource for the generation to come . this might lead to a revolution where people would prefer to travel in a more nature friendly mode than car . this can already be seen among people of today . they try using their bike or walk to nearby distance and travel in group to school so that only one car need to be fueled . this attitude might take a wider turn after 20 year resulting in fewer car on the road . in all the way stated above the ultimate result would be fewer car . even if this is not the the ultimate result we should work for it to become the ultimate result . so that we can make our world a better place to live by avoiding global warming and pollution .
