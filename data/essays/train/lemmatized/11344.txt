the role of advertisments in purchasing behaviour of consumer for any product is continously rising from a long time . it is true that advertisments make product 's feature or chracterstic much better than they really are . i am strongly agree with this statment because of number of valid reason and example . it affect consumer and manufacturer in number of way . first , financial importance of advertisment to manufacturer of product . any manufacturer of product want to sell his product to earn the money or profit out of that process . to introduce a new product or stand with competition with other provider they usually need to advertise the product . advertisment are usually an expensive way of promotion . therefore , manufacturer use the best part of product to highlight in advertisments . they usually hide the negative part of product . thus consumer usally disguised by claim made by product in advetisments . on the other hand advertisement are also in favour of consumer . these promotional activity make them aware of new product and selective feature of product . second , effect of advertisement on consumer . advertisments in pharmaceutical industry usually show the postive feature of any drug . advertisments of drug vioxx by merck labs never talked about the harmfull affect of drug on cardiovascular system on patient . these advertisments increase the usage of drug in consumer and ended up with serious effect on blood system . on the other hand advertisments help consumer or patient about the availability of various treatment option . after the advertisments of drug from pharmaceutical company , patient come to know about the underlying disease and check with their physicains for availabilty of treatment option . therefore , advertisments improves the quality of life for some patient . to sum up , we can say that advertisment usually hide the negative feature of product . but on other side it is beneficial for both manufacturer a well a consumer . advertisements give more chance to growth and innovation .
