people that try new thing and that take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well , are considered successfull . a succesfull person is someone who is open minded . this person is always willing to do something else , to try new and varied experience in life , and always learned from the experience . that person will not care if someday she will have to go to another part of the world , to run an office there , she will only see it a a new ecperience in life and a an adventure . another point is to take risk . life is full of risk and people should be ready to face them with optimism . if people stay always doing the same they will live in a monotonous world , and this will only cause them to get bored of what they are doing and stop believing on themselfs . instead an optimistic and succesfull person will always find the way of tuning that into an expereince given by life , find the positive side of it , or in other case they will see this a a lesson to learn , and so they will change what they are doing or the job they are at . an example of a succesfull person , is someone that , is starting a new company . this is taken a a risk , but a a risk that is worth trying . changing the way of living , that you have always been used to , into a wild and adventurous life , full of travel in which you meet new people , and learn a lesson of life from them , that later on you could apply on a company , is also concidered a a quality . humans learn from mistake , they teach you life lesson that you could only gain by facing new experience . trassspasing the save side of life , and taking risk , in any type of way , no matter if you make mistake or if you regret it , will always be a price you recive . this quality i believe make a person successful
