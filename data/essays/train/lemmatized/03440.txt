it is usually said that successful people are full of confident . some are very confident about what they know how to do well , while few others have confident to try new thing and take risk . however , i strongly believe that successful people just do what they already know how to do well and that is the key for them to succeed , because of the following reason ; successful people are usually famous a the expert of certain area that they have studied for a long time , and they are wise enough to predict the failure . being a successful person , we have to be good at certain area of study or have certain talent that can be desired by others . if once we become a expert of certain thing , we are about to succeed or at least have obtained the possibility to be successful . people become successful in this way . those who are already successful in the world , they have digged only one spot on the ground . in other word , they show much confidence on the area that they see the potantial from . since they already know how to do well on the certain object , they expand their ability rather than try new thing that they have not experienced before . wisdom is one of the crucial key point of being successful . successful people are very wise since they have been using their wisdom to be on the top . they can predict what is going to happen if they get off their track . for instance , the ceo of starbucks , world 's most famous coffee chain , once had a thought to have some change on the store . he wa thinking of selling some other fast food in starbucks . when he eventually anticipate that the class of starbucks will be dropped down , he stopped the thinking and just doing what he ha been doing .
