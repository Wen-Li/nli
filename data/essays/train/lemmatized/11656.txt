scientist often make prediction about future change in society , especially when it come to technical innovation . indeed , it is imaginable that in future year , people use fewer car than nowadays . however , i would not fully agree with the statement . on the one hand , it is true that the public transportion system get better . especially in highly populated area such a huge city , the public transport becomes better integrated into the town 's scape , just think of berlin , hamburg , london or paris . there , it is more comfortable and much faster to take the bus or the underground . another development speaking for fewer car are sinking travel cost . over the last year , it became much cheaper to travel by train or plane . companies like ryanair or vogtlandexpress , a competiting train brand , offer very good travel , even within germany . so that it could be a logical consequence that car transport will be used fewer . on the other hand , do both theory work for area of high population . if i think my home town , the public transport system is nearly underdeveloped compared to berlin . since the main part of germany or other industrialised country doe not live in the huge city , people will need car to get from their home to the working place . i think , that i will not change within the next twenty year , so that in average of the whole country , the car use will not decrease much .
