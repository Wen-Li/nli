from the intotality i would like to cite and support it to my position stating young people enjoy life more than oolder people do . firstly i would like to make the reliable reason and example to support my statement considering it from the religious view point most of the older people obviously like spent more of their time with the prayer beating . while most of the young people will be busy with their daily activies including with the responsibilites towards the community and society . the above statement is also flawless when we deem with the national defense , sports , etc. , most of the time young people are compeled to fun and entertainment to relieve their stress which is an involuntary action . but despite of being supported to the statement i also found it indefensable and flaw . if we look back to the history , ethic they were lot of hero are older people who enjoyed what they are when it is characterised to the politics etc. , might be they cant enjoy with the physical presence but they enjoy enciting the situation with their intelluctual mind . statistically the percentage of older people is greater in psychological study and lot more . if we acquire the statistic of older people and younger it would be obviously older people who enjoy a lot . because who doe n't go through the hard phase like stress and theraphy unlike young people and inturn they are in vague calling it a fun . inaddition to the statement i also doe not agree with both of the statement that only young people enjoy rather than older people . supporting it a ` enjoy ' term is neither inscribed with the frame of rule of dogma it depends from the state of mind and sense of time they could enjoy cause it inferres to the personlity of one self . finally i would conclude that the above statement is inappropriate considering the social activity and indefendable from the various direction aspect of one 's sustainability .
