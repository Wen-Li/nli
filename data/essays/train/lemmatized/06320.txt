in my opinion it is more important for student to understand concept than to study or learn the fact pertaining to the subject . i have experienced a lot of problem in this matter in my childhood day where i usually concentrate more on the fact than idea and concept . one such experience occured in my tenth class where i usually learn fact of my subject such a physic , social , mathematics before exam . by the time , it is ready to write the exam i usually forget most of answer or fact which i learned earlier and get le mark in exam . my friend of mine on the contrary , usually concentrate on idea and concept in physic , social subject and he is able to reproduce successfully what he learned in exam without any trouble . another experience i faced , when i am writing entrance exam for engineering course , where i concentrate more on formulaes and principle related to mathematics and doe not concentrate on idea and concept . due to tension in the exam i am unable to recall the formulaes what i learned and ended up with low score on the exam . however for undergraduate student it is not necessary to understand idea and concept pertaining to their subject because actually undergraduate course is of four year so it is hard to remeber idea and concept for various subject . instead they must remember only fact except their favourite subject , where they are going to do research in graduate coure . in conclusion one thing can be drawn that student must study idea and concept upto intermediate education and not necessary to remember concept in their undergraduate course .
