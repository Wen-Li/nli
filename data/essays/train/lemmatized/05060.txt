there is a public controversy nowadays that whether we should decrease our car-use in the following twenty year . differnt people have different view due to their individual angle . the people who prefer to drive the car hold the opinion that the industrial development need transportation by using car . but some person think these vehicle will pollute our environment , so the country should limit to use car a traffic tool . as far a i am concerned , i would absolutely choose the latter opinion . i would reason and provide convincing example to support my viewpoint a follows . the foremost reason we can not deny is that the whole world 's evironment become worse gradually . the industrial development without careful consideration caused problem even worse than we can imagine . the whole country overflowed by pollution like the white pollution , nosie pollution , the air pollution and light pollution . and many amout of them are caused by using car . and those pollution will threat our health . also the increasing car burn fuel larger than ever before , the energy in the whole world is decrease fastly . maybe in few year , we could not use fuel to move our car . the reason why i cast my preference for car decreasing is that a lot of specises have already extincted . because they can not accommodate themseleves to the changing living condition . as a undergraduate student majored in life science , i will do something for those living creature . so i hope we can find some other vehicle to take but not car which will produce toxic output . therefore i always take my short trip by cycling instead of traveling by car . of couses , there are some merit by using car . but the advantage and the disadvantage of using car are carefully compared . we can see clearly that protecting our enviornment outweigh the advantage of using car . all in all , consider all support pointed above , we can ratinoally see that deceasing the car use is very important of our dailylife .
