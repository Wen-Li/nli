at school , in each subject , we learn different thing and the way to learn it can be different . in history , for instance , we learn more fact than we have to understand some process whereas in biology understanding idea and concept is the base of the course . i am convinced that is important and more interesting to understand some idea and concept but i think that is equally important to learn fact . first of all , i think that is interesting and challenging to understand some idea and concept we may provide a considerable concentration and it may take a long time we should have some difficulty as the result when we understand it , it providde some satisfaction . for example , i remember when i wa at high school in a chemistry class , we had to analyse and understand how plant can do the photosynthesis . it appeared difficult but it wa interesting and it motivated me to find this process . when i understood it , i wa satisfactioned . although it seems to be very interesting , it is also important to leran fact even if it could be boring . in a nutshell , it 's equally important to learn fact and to understand idea .
