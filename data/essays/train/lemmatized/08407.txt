in my view successful people do what they alredy know how to do well because if they knew somethig aboout what they are doing it will be more advantageous . by comparing with the previous people they may set goal and they will perticularly know how much time it had taken to the previous people who had alredy tried . and he may also get an idea why the previous person or idea is failed and what must be done to over come that . i think no body want to take risk if they had choosen what they really didnot know and it is also very difficult to deal with the new rather than with the well established or well known . they are much more clear a they did it many time and also so many had did it previously and many reference and the work they did preiously will help them on the other hand if they try the new idea they do not know they will succed or not and this lead to get some negative idea such that if i fails ? and they even feel emberaseed in the comunity a if they really failed if they do what they had knew previously succeding chance is more and they some positive force by imagining after their success will travel them much faster to their goal . for an example many scientist worked with their professers after gaining knowledge and knowing about the thing they will get an clear idea by doing the same research for year and this will lead to the extension of the previous idea which he had aquired previously . and a history and the science have so many record who aucceded in this way . and also a the child of the great scholar buissiness men muscians u will daily accostemed to the atmosphere and this also encourages to go in to the study and succed in that field this is slso one way their involves le risk and le mental stress and u will be successfull in life in 80 of 100 case a they clerly watch and do the same thng the previous knowledge will help rather than trying different thing . so i conclude that it is risk free and sucees chanes or more so many choose what they did earlier .
