i disagree with the statement . i think it 's so hard to decrease the number of car and it take more than twenty year . i will describe my main idea . first , it is true that there are many people who go to their office or school by car . they use car because they do n't have any other way such a train or bus . the solution for this problem is to construct them more . if the govenment doe it , car will be fewer , but it take a lot of time and cost . in addition to it , i do n't think that the government take an immediate action for that . second , actually car are convenient , especially if you live in a rural area . people who live in a rural area , for example , ca n't go to the supermarket by their foot , because it is too far . that 's why these people have to use car even if they do n't to want to . the solution for this problem is to built many store in a rural area , but it is not easy and realistic . as long a there are rural country , car will not be decreased . third , there are many work which need car . for example , carring good from manufacturing company to store . they are forced to use car , because they have a lot of thing to carry . for these reason , i disagree with the statement .
