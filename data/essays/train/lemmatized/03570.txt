i agree with this satement . let me say definition of car first . according to our common sense car is a kind of transportation . it ha a wheel and engine to make power . it consumes gasoline or disel . this is traditional concept of car that we knew . but in the future those definition are can change . for example , future car can move without wheel and driver . may be it dose n't have to run on the street . future car can use solar power , elecrticity and water . it will be semi-airplane . but shape look like a car and function will be quiet diffrent . sometimes we see in sf-movies like `` star-wars '' . these day air pollution is becomes big issue in this world . main cause of air pollution is a car . many motor company are developing electric car and hydrogen car . it can be a solution for reducing air pollution . but still it is not a popular car . price is very high and function is not perfect . however within ten year it will be more popular car than present . modern hig-technology is changing rapidly . think about computer and electronics . it ca n't compare with just ten year before . changing is more faster than our imagination . i believe that ten year of tufure ha same value of era with 50 year of past . it mean twenty year of our future ha same value with one century . during last ten decases how much changed our world ? it wa really beyond our immagination . we will experience again , those kind of rapid changing in our culture within twenty year . therefore i can say twenty year later we will use diffrent kind of transportation with car . i do n't know what we call future transportation . but it will be diffrent with traditional car . traditional car we will see in the museum .
