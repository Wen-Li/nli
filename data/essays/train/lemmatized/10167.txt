as i have never had the opportunity to study one specific subject , i do n't really know how it is like , but i will try to imagine it the best that i can , comparing it advantage to those of the other alternative . a student who attend an university course have to do an important choose , he had to decide if specializing in one specific matter or not . i think that specializing in one specific subject is necessary in a lot of camp , for example for a medic or engineering . in fact , is impossible to arrive at an high livel of knowledge in many matter . on the other hand , exsist the risk of a wrong choose about the subject of specialization . i know many person that have changed the university a lot of time , and this may become very dangerous for the career . it is also important have a complete view about an argument or a problem , and only a broad knowlodege of many academic subject allows that . so , after looking at all these different advantage for both the side , it is very hard for me to come a conclusion . i guess the the best solution is to specializing in few subject .
