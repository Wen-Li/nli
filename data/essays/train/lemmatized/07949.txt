i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept rather than learning fact . learning fact is just a metter of remembering detail . when knowing a fact is required , one can always go and check himself on a book . lots of book have been written with that purpouse and there are a lot of written material which can be useful in order to check a date or a name or whatever . the hardest thing is understanding the reason why a certain fact ha occured , the idea that have brought to a specific event , the concept that lay under a certain episode . i think that the fondamental issue is to teach the student to become confident with this process . for example , once that a student is tought to understand and recognize the cause that have brought to the second world war , detail about when where who and what can be left to several information that can be found in book . on paper and other material it is possiple to find a lot of information about the mere fact and every time it is needed , one can go and check . students should be rather tought how to use these information properly . ideas and concept provide a frame in which it is then possible to orientate themselves , in order to give sense to thing which ha happened in the past , which occur in the present time or which could happen in the future . we have to remenber that past can explain the present and somehow foretell the future a well . if student learn how to collect ides and concept from fact , they are then able to give a place to mere fact . well , i can not denye that knowing fact and detail do make sense itself and somehow it is also important for knowledge . however i think that is not the primary thing . first of all idea and concept are worthy to be understood , then detail come . so , in conclusion , i would like to outline again that understanding idea and concept is more important then learning fact .
