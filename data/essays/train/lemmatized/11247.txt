the statement advocate that having broad knowledge of many acadmic subject is better than having specilization on one . however , in my opininon , the question can not have a binary answer . there could be situation when a broad knowledge of all concerned subject is really needed . on the other hand , in some case specilization o more important . in some case , one might just need particular skillset and other skill might not be of much use . for example , an mba student who is aming to become an investment banker need not be strong in all the management subject , but he/she really need to be specialized in fiannce . on the other hand , sometimes job requires a good overall understanding of all related topic . continuing on the last example , if the same mba student want to be a genral manager in a firm , he/she should have a broad knowledge of all the management practice and subject . in this case , specilization can not be of much use . there could be case when secilization is needed ` on demand ' . once one might be working in some area , and sfter some time he/she might need other skill . in such case one need to have good knowledge of all related subject . with a solid foundation like this , one can gain specilized skill easily if needed and this wopuld not require seperate acadmic specilization . for example , so , in my opinion , while one must have some knowledge of all the concerned area he/she is supposed to work on , whether specilization is required depends on specific case . sometimes , it better to be master of one , while sometimes being jack of all trade might be more useful .
