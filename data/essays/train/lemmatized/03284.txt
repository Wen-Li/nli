young people usually cost lot of time on computer , cell phone and go out for fun besides school and work time . but i do n't think it mean they do not give enough time to helping their community . i think the community ca n't separate form the common active and people . young people can learn a lot in friend , computer and somthing or someone they meet in life . for example , i always cost a lot of time on computer and interenet . i met many kind of people online i will not find at school . i always can find new thing from them . and i can aways get the news online when i want . but in the eye of other people , maybe i just play the computer all dat and do not give enough time to helping my community . that is why i do not think young people they do not give enought time to helping their community . i think they just change their way to do it .
