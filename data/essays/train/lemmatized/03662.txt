the pleasure of learning is abig part of the civilization . to opserve what you experience ha everything to do with how you use what you have learned . undrestanding coceptes and idea give a big opprtunity for ceareation and ceariative people never consider the importance of fact because if we beilive that everyting is a fact there wo n't have a space to think and brith with new idea i beilive that what had happend in art for example it built through different generation who represented different coseptes in different socites and if we look through the history of art starting from the early civilization like in cefeman work skratching on a stone till video art , sculpure and computer art . if we look to artist like piccasso for example , i beilive that what made him a brrelliant artist wa two thing first of all wa how he loved trying working with everything and also bing in a society that encourages the new idea and it pushed him to be what he wa . and that atmosphere of experements and flying away with new idea that mainly creats everythng new . that what they encourage now in the very high standared art school all over the world , you take few year leaning how to draw and paint and see musumes but the main pat in there plane to make good artist is to give a big space to think . so if you see a great huge sculpture done by the ancient egyptian you have to think about it not to only enjoyit ` like whey the artist coosed thies stone color and why he suuorted the back with arectagler stone that will migt lead to a new sculpture of yours using the sanme stone colr but with an abestrsct shape'
