i agree the statement . being successful ha various meaning , for example economically , socially , or so on ? if i definite being successful a achieving something that others want but do n't have or can not obtain easily , those people who are successful seem to tend to try new thing and take risk . firstly , if they want to continue to be successful , they have to try new thing and take risk . in the business scene , successful investor try to look for somethings new . they always try to do something different from normal . because only doing something normal can not lead to making money . by searching for different way , they can have more possibility to encounter better way and unique idea . by doing the same thing a others , normally it doe n't make profit . second , they are tired of only doing what they already know how to do well . they alwasys like to challenge new thing and do n't stick to the thing they know . they are looking for something that make them excited . for example , rich peolpe are tired of saving money . as they want to feel excited , they spend money on casino . they want to be risky more than defensive third , successful people can take risk . they do n't have to defend themselves because they are already well establiesd and stable enough . their stable status make them challenge new thing and take risk .
