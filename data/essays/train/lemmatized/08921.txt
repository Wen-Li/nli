advertissment is on of the most important way for the company to improve their benifets , and to sell more and more product . regardeless if it 's tv advertisment or radio , or internet , it must be intresting and remarkable for the audience in order to do his job . unfortunately some company go too far and make their product appear much better than they really are , which make the consumer upset after he buy the product . i still remeber many toy and device i bought when i wa young , actually i forced my parent to buy , because it wa really amazing on the screen , but i wa really shocked , bacause it wa diffrent from what i 've seen in the advertisement . why do they do that ? i think because of the strong competition with the other company , they have no choice . they must make their product look perfect a much a they can , otherwise , no one will buy it , specially with the kid stuff . the child doe n't have the ability to analyse the advertisment and figure out if it 's real or not , unlike the mature . i think the caompanies found their self in this situation , and they hardly can change it , because of simple reason . the customer doe n't help them to change it ! imagine your self watching a reasnoble advertisment , showing the advantage and the disadvantage of the product , will you be intrested in it ? or will you think this way : if they could n't hide the disadvantage in the advertisement they made by themselves , how can i trust their product ? advertisment now is a very big business . huge company work in this field , it 's not easy to change this industry in order to have simple , honest , reasnoble advertisement , unless we work really hard .
