some people might think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a good way . but , a group tour normally ha it strict schedule and doe not offer the tourist in group any chance to meet many people in new place . so , i strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . first , a group tour ha it own strict schedule and all the tour team member should follow it . and it mean that i can not choose the place where i want go and the food which i want to eat . for example , when i went to thailand for the first time , i chose a group tour because i wa young and it wa the first time to go abroad . i really wanted to go many attractive shop and spot in the street in bangkok , but i could n't go there because i wa in a group tour and i had to follow the schedule which the tour company offered . and i had to wake up early in the morning and had to go back to hotel in early evening , even though i wanted to enjoy more sleep in the bed in the morning and wanted to go outside in the night . it wa really bad experience . second , a group tour doe not offer many opportunity to meet other people for it tour team member . becuase a group tour move together by it tour bus , it is difficult to meet many people in new place . but if i travel alone , i can meet many people and feel their culture . when i went to tokyo by myself , i met really many people there . i could talk with them and some of them became my friend ! even though i could not go a lot of sightseeing spot a efficiently a a group tour , choosing a place where i go and going there by a subway were really exciting experience and japanese people were kind to let me know the way . all thing considered , i definitely belive that a group tour led by a tour guide is not interesting or exciting at all . by going new place alone , we can learn more about the new place and feel much about the people there .
