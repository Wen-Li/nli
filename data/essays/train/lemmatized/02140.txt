i strongly disagree with the statement made that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to help the community . i agree that the time have changed and people have become more busy and mechanical in their routine , but still people are taking time out of their schedule to help the charity , or the under-previleged community . youth is a prime-time in any individual 's life , where he/she ha to concentrate on making a good career and pursue their interest at the same time . but i would also like to add that it is `` the '' time where one realizes his/her responsibility towards the society . many successful sportsman , musician , actor have started working towards the devlopment of the society when they realized that it wa the time to give-back to the society . in-fact the miss universe and miss world paegents also have the same theme `` beauty with purpose '' . young people across the world are actively participating in movement like wwf , green peace , unicef etc to make this place better . i would like to add that many successful young people like bill gates , michael jackson , david beckham have donated huge amount of their fortune to the charity . there are few people who do not care about the society and are self-centred . but it is the way one is brought up , that make an individual more socially responsible . to help others around you give u the great feeling of purpose and satisfaction . people when they realize it , they will surely help the community in one way or the other . i would like to give the example of mother theresa who moved out of her country while she wa young and reached india to help the poverty-stricken and the under-previleged . she led a great life of example which i think everyone should remember and give back to the society , in our own possible way .
