we can see any kind of advertisement on tv . some of them are creativity and make the product look useful . what is the purpose of the advertisement ? we can understand in following reason . first , customer is willing to buy the product after watching the advertisement . second , give the customer enough information about the product in a short time . third , there are many competition in the same kind of product . even though the sale understand their product is good , customer will never know that if they never buy it . all they can do is to show their product in advertisement . although sometimes it seems much better than they really are , it is just strategy . other company also use the same way . we all know that if the advertisement want to be watched a many viewer a they can , we should put it in the popular program . it cost a lot of money . if we can not give customer enough information about what the product is , it just waste money . the best way is to pretend it is really attractive and useful . sometimes customer do not understand what the difference between one company 's product and others ' product is . the only difference is the advertisement . every company try to make their product look better than they really are . in conclusion , although i would like to buy the product better than it shown on advertisment , i do not how to choose the product if i have never used it . i will choose the product in a good advertisement . i agree most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
