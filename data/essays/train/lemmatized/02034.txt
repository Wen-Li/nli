no , i dont agree with the statement that say it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , because in my opinion i think that the fact is the most important thing we should understand , because the fact is reality , the fact is what a person is going to face in life not an idea and because a fact is only an idea till you make it a fact . the first reason for me to beleive that the statement is not true is because fact is reality . idea is only a thought u think about and thats not in ur face , but in the other hand fact is what u c infornt of u and what u face , it the opsitculle in front of you the object you have to learn about and deal with . fact are unchangable , unlike idea where a person can change his or her idea in different time in there life and in different sittuantions . the second reason i think that fact is the most important is almost like the fisr reason , fact is what u confront in life , a person should learn the fact and understand them . because these are the real thing in life , and they are the opsticalls you face , a persone will never face an idea , or do somthing or become someone with an idea . . but a person can face a fact , a person a persone can do something and become someone with a fact . the third and finnal reaso i think that the statement ( it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ) is not true is because an idea is only an idea till u do it and it becomes a fact . a fact is an idea turned in to an fact after acting and doing something about it . so what im trying to say is that it is important for student to understand idea and cocepts , but it is more important for them to learn the fact , because the fact are what make an idea work , and an idea is wourth anything untill it becomes a fact .
