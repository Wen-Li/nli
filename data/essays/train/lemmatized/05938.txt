it can not be made a true statement that young people enjoy lide more than older people do . everyone enjoys life in a different way . yet , it is true that young people have more energy and willingness to do new thing and experiment , that doe not mean that they enjoy life more than older people do . it all depends on one 's view of life , and how is is going to be enjoyed . for some people enjoying life can be lay doing in the grass in the middle of a forest and observe the sky for the whole day . however , for other people that could be considered be considered a a boring and even an annoying thing to do ; they would rather go and play soccer . everything depends on what one like and one 's view of what enjoying life is . it is true that young people have le experience and much more energy and wish to do and experiment new thing in life , and enjoy experimenting new sensation ; the experience that a mature adult ha let him make it 's own prototipe of what a enjoyable life is like . young people are always learning new thing and learning come from experimenting and experiencing new thing . young people are often considered risky too , since they do n't know much about life and have not matured completely yet ; they enjoy taking risk in life and assuming the consequence is the part that most of the young people do n't like . from my personal experience i can say that it is not true that young people enjoy life more than older people do . when i lived with my dad i remember that me and my dad used to spend a lot of time together and he always had just a much fun a i did , or even more . and i did n't find quite enjoyable to go out with my dad , however , he did ; everything is about taste and the way you see life . if you enjoy life reading , somebody else might find reading boring and he would play football instead .
