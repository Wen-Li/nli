to be a wise enough person people should know lot of thing from different field . however knowing everything is not possible even for the machine having a large capasity of memory . in my opinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject because one may do not have a conclusion while dealing with detail , it is not possible to be good in all field , filling the memory is not necessary . firstly , if one try to investigate and make a knowledge of many subject then he will not have time to make his conclusion or even he may not have a conclusion . if he specialize and investigate the other field just when he need , then he must go in detail so the possibility to have a conclusion is higher . for instance , a an academic research area mathematics is so wide even in the branch . it already take so much time to learn one field . if one try to know all the detail in other branch then it is impossible to have an article about his research . secondly , it is impossible to be an expert in every field . finally , human memory is not so wide to keep everything . the thing that is not used anymore will be deleted after a time . so filling the memory with the thing that will not be used is unnecessary , since it is not necessary to know everything . in conclusion , it is better to work on a specific subject than to work on many subject .
