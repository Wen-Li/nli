knowledge subjects knowledge is a very good and commplacate thing at the same time . i'ts a good thing to heve and share a knowledge but the idea is do you prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subject or specialize in one specific subject ? . in my opinion having a knowledge specialize in one specific subject is better . i disagree with the idea having a broad of knowledge because alot of reason . my mind will not able to understand and save all the knowledge thats will be taken by many academic , but if it were one specific subject i will . for example taking a knowledge about a history a a one subject it 's not easy a having a knowledge about history and art and math it will be vnot easy . picking up a specific subject that you love and you want to learn it it much easy and fun for u to learn alot of knowledge either you love or not , one subject you will enjoy it and you wont be bored of it . for example i love histroy so if i have aknowledge of it i 'll be able to love it and get exaited and enterist about it . of my point of viem learning or taking a knowledge from different place is a bad idea it will make you transport from place to another . for example if i go to learn in a 3 academic it will waist my time and i 'll get board too fast ! thats why i prefer the knowlege from one place and one subject either . at the end if you want to take a lot of enjoyable , meaningfull and entersting knowledge you should go for one specialize specific subject to keep the joeyfull and beautyful moment by having the knowledge , it is the best way .
