the statement in contention is , `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . i partially agree with the statement . the reason for my partial agreement being , the nature of the topic that is reasonably hard to predict and open for many alternative . firstly , let u consider the condition where we are now . assuming the present condition prevail in the next twenty year , i think we might have a decline in the usage of car . this may be attributed to the condition of scarcity of oil reserve and which in turn result in the increase of gas price all around the world . which make it uneconomical to maintain a car . considering these condition the chance that a common man may use his car for general purpose may come down significantly . secondly , considering the case , where ultra modren subway and metropolitian transit in the urban area make way for fast , efficient and convinent transport . the citizen may consider these mean economical a well a le strenous than driving their own vehicle to work . in this probable case , there is a possibility of the reduced usage of car . thirdly , if substantial progress is made in the field of alternate renewable energy source and hybrid vehicle , which solve the problem due to pollution and the problem of rising fuel price , then there is a probable chance that ther might be a significant increase in the usage of car . and also in the case , where different mean of harvesting the energy to drive the car are developed by some of the technical breakthrough , it is very much possible that the usage of car may increase significantly . to sum up , it is very much possible that the usage of car in the next twenty year may be reduced if the existing condition prevail . even it is also hard to predict for sure that there wo n't be any technical breakthrough which will help manufacture car which are efficient enough to make them economic enough .
