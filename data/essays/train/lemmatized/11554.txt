i agree with the condition , young people do enjoy life more than older people . not only because older people had lived longer , but also young people are more active . yet , young people like to try anything new , they are more willing to accept the change of the world . because older people have lived longer , so they had try anything new during their `` younger life . '' as they grow older , they are more mature , they know what is the most important in their life . for example , a young man of age 18 will go to night club more often than a man who is 23 , the reason is because that the man know there is just a place for rest and maye he need to work on the next day . on the other hand , the young man will think the night club is very fansy and fun , because there is lot hot girl or any other reason that attract his attention . in this case young man know how to release himself in a night club , but the man did not get rest totally in the club . young people are usually more active than the older people , because they have more energy , yet , they are easily to take attention on new thing than the older people . for examplel , let say a 18 young man and a 25 man , they both like to read novel , but maybe the man would not to go to the store to rent it , and just have fun sitting there to read , or go online , do some novel search . oppositie , the young man may go to the store and sit there 4 hour just watching novel and enjoy in it . older people can not do anything they want freely , because they need to think more and they have to have the motivate to do it . no matter what the change is , older people do not like it and they can not survive from it , but young people , even if they do not like the change , they can still survive from it . for example , grandmother did not think that her granddaughter can go to school and married at age of 16 or 17 . different from the mother , she would let her daughter go to school , and to be educated , not marrying until the age of 28 , so then the grandmother would always complain to the mother that she should not let her daughter to go to school . all in all , older people can not enjoy their life , not because they had lived what the young is living but because they are not a active a the young do . moreover , older people do not like anything new or to be changed , they are stuck in their own world . which is different from the young people , who is enjoy their life , play around , and try any new thing .
