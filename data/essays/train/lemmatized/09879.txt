i do n't agree with the statement because of many reason . one reason could be the laziness of people . i think that many people like best moving by car than walking , because car is more comfortable and faster . another reason could be that nowadays car are safer than in the past so i suppose that in the future they will be even safer than now . improvements in producing will permitt avoiding many danger and incident , for example using super advanced airbags and staff like that . furthermore i can say that the increasement of population could be another good reason . i remember my grandfather 's story about car . he used to tell me that in the past not many people could afford a car so they were fewer than now . in our society many people can afford a car , also using strategy like leasing or renting . the population ha expanded and migrated from the centre of big city to the nearby town , like countryside or small town . more people now need a car to go to work in big city or even in another city . another important reason is the bad quality of the public transport . often it is difficult to move from town to town using public transport because train are delayed or the station is far from home . the subway also is not so efficient . sometimes it is even unpleasent to use public transport because it is dirty , or broken in many way . for all these reason i think that in twenty year there will be more car than today . i think that almost everyone think that driving a car is much more pleasent than taking a train . population will continue to grow up , and in my opinion more people mean more car , with all it implication like traffic and pollution .
