what i feel is it depends on the level of education we are in , for example if we r in a under graduate stage it better to learn about various academic subject when we come to graduation stage it better to study the subject in which we want to specialize in future at undergraduation stage it good to learn all academic subject , we r never aware that how the others subject influence u in future for example myself being an undergraduate student i wa asked to choose different subject and i had a choice to study both math and science and when i came to graduation stage my subject wa computer science and it is no were related to physic and math but when i wa given a paper for my nasa project , math and science helped me a lot to slove arthematic problem related to problem sloving in programmable language and next physic made me to slove some climatic problem this had a big impact on my paper presentation because i could do it very quickly with out any error and when a man reach to a gradutate stage he should be specialized in only one subject because the course we do mainly deal with many practicals more over since it is the most crtical stage in our life because after tat we finally end up in any work , we dont continue our study again so unless untill if we r not mastering in the subject which we need to do it , then we will end up in a confusion stage so what i strongly belive is when we reach graduation stage we need to work strongly on the subject we choose , tat lead u to work for a good company , it like jack of all arts and masters of none it a famous quote it say tat being jack in all art is waste than mastering in one art this will strongly support my statement when come to student who r doing graduation so the people who r undergraduate can work on all subject , but when it come to the matter of graduation we need to master just one specialize subject .
