i would agree with the statement , even though i must admit that the question if young people enjoy life more than old people do , is certainly very difficult to answer , because you have to compare people out of different time and social structure , with very different problem , option , possibility and wish . let me first shortly explain the background , out of which most - if not all - older people that i know come : most of them experienced war or the time after war ; a time full of scarcity and poverty . everyone had to work very hard for his life . when there wa money left , it wa seldomly simply spent for something like holiday or having a fine dinner or theater . it wa rather saved for bad time that could probably come again . they preferred - or perhaps were forced by society and expectation put on them - to go on working rather than enjoying life or doing something for themselves , just to be secure . over the decade , life got easier of course and also those people learned to enjoy life . but i think that in most older people there is still always this feeling of first work , then enjoy their own life . on the other hand , life for young people today is also certainly hard and not easy , since they have a lot of pressure to bear , implied on them from school , study or job . but i think they grew up in a society in which enjoying life is something other people make money with . its a business - enjoying life is something like a symbol for wealth which is highly promoted in advertisement and marketing . furthermore , it is socially accepted to enjoy life , to go on holiday , to visit bar , restaurant , cinema or to subscribe for a wellness-week . for these reason i think it easier and more common among young people to enjoy life than for old people .
