learning should be based on idea and concept mastering the idea and concept are essential part of learning . i completely believe that idea and concept is much more important for the student than just focusing on the fact . there are several reason for this . first of all , understanding the idea provides a stimulus to the brain and help positive thinking , learning and mastering of the subject . with the concept being understood , one can apply these idea to any similar situation . it is much easier to connect one idea to another and build a logical conclusion about a subject or theory . secondly , understanding the fact also need some idea to fully grasp the knowledge of the subject . without any idea or logical stream of thought behind , it will be very difficult even to understand why a fact actually happened . focusing only on the fact and not looking at the underlying concept is like building something without a solid foundation . understanding the concept behind a particular theory also allows to deal with unexpected situation in a better way . for example , if somebody know the concept behind a mathematical theory , one can easliy solve any problem without memorizing the content or fact of the problem . similarly understanding concept of physic allows a person to apply the same principal to a variety of situation and provide useful explanation . understanding the idea & concept also promotes further learning . it is easier to teach a subject to others if one ha mastered the idea and concept behind it . lastly , understanding the idea and concept help the development of the subject itself . with the concept fully understood , one can then build more useful idea over them . these idea then become part of the subject or theory itself and make the application of the theory to real life more useful .
