nowadays in our society , most of the people want to be on the `` safe side of life '' . if it is not 100 percent sure they do n't do it , because there could be a risk which they do n't want to take . but is that really the best way , only doing what you already know how to do well ? in my opinion , the answer is no ! you have to do risky thing to be succesful . for example , if you want to improve in your work life , you have to do task which you have n't done already . so , you can show that you do n't want to stay at the same level , but increase your knowledge . this show your boss that you are commited and have a great loyality . for the student life , in particular , it ha to be absolutely normal to try new thing or meet some new people . it 's not possible to earn a great vage after university , if a student ha n't showed great flexibility . a student who get 's always great grade can maintain with only studying in his common environment . but when he is ready to take risk and want 's to succeed in life he could also go abroad . in an other country he learn 's a new language , get in touch with a new culture and meet some new friend . so he can build a network which could be very useful in his life . in my opinion , it is like at the stock market . you can only earn a great benefit , if you are ready to take a risk . if you only invest in blue chip , your chance to obtain a great benefit is much lower a if you put your money in more risky asset . finally , i think all successful people who are working in the business had to do a risky decision in their carreer ( e.g. bill gates , donald trump , josef ackermann , ... )
