it is a common opinion to think that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have the strength and the health . maybe this popular statement wa true until fifty year ago but great shift occured and thing have changed . so , why can we argue that older people enjoy life a much a - or more than - young people ? to answer to this horny issue , we will need in a first part to talk about the shift that occured in the way of life of the different generation and we will then discus if young people enjoy life more than older people do . in the fifty , we could say that young people had a better life than their ancestor . indeed , the older people often retired when they were quite old - often 65 year old - . so they were very tired and did not enjoy the life . actually people died younger and they were often not very rich . all the money wa used to raise the numerous child of the family . so , the older people spent their time complaining and suffering disease . but thngs have changed since the ninety . thanks to the technological and medical breakthrough , people can expect to live until they are 80 . difficult and dangerous work have mainly disappeared so people can retire with a very good health and many year to live . besides , thanks to the reduction of the size of the family , the older people have a lot of money to spend . so , nowadays , the older people enjoy more life than young people in my opinion because they are strong and rich . so they can do whatever they want and they profit ! they travel a lot , care for their son ' child - but with pleasure - , experience new technological activity , attend cultural event and even go back to school to accurate their knowledge . however , it ha become more and more dificult to be young . indeed , the length of degree at the university have sharply increased and so did the price for the lease of an appartment . in a nutshell i would say that the older people can afford to enjoy life more than young people because they have still a good health and live better thanks to the improvement realized in the field of medecine . but money is not everything and the young people have a very strong advantage : they have still many good time to experience , they do not have to look backward .
