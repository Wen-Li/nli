i 'm not agree with this sentence for different reason that emerged from my personal experience . first af all , i see that my grand-parents enjoy a well a me their personal time because they do a lot of thing , they travel and they do some little work . they are very busy with the family because they also care my little young cousin . i could be agree with this sentence in a different meaning like the possibility for young people to do more like sport for exemple . maybe some old people do n't have envoy to do because they are also old in their mind . my grand-parents are very young in their way of thinking , in their soul . despite the pas of the year , they are always the same and sometimes i say to my grand-mother to be calm or quiet because she doe n't have twenty year and she ca n't do transport some heavier thing for exemple . it 's funny to describe that because i realize that i 'm lucky to have them , a very good exemple for my future . of course i think that other old people do n't want to do the same thing of when they were young because they are tired or they have some pain . it 's difficult to be old because you have to minimize your activity and generally you do n't want . i think that all the `` epoch '' of the man 's life have something interesting to do , to accomplain . .. old people could for exemple go to a university to obtain an education that they ca n't acquire when they were young , for different reason like to war or the poor condition of the family . i have a cousin that go into a university of the `` terza eta ' ( third age ) and he 's enthousiastic of this possibility . i suggest also to my grand-parents to save their free time to organize beautiful trip or travel around the world because they have work all the time in the past and in this manner they can enjoy now their life better than they were young .
