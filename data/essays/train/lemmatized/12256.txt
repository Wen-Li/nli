humankind life for the pursuit of happiness a long a it ha got rid of what could seem to u a trivial point : the struggle for survival . kant affirms that the doxa happiness ha nothing in common with what philosopher considered a happiness . according to the doxa , eg , the common opinion , people have reached happiness when they could enjoy freely life . to be happy all life long you need to enjoy all life long . nonetheless , even this restricted vision of happiness doe n't seem easy to reach . when are we able to freely enjoy in our life ? can we say that young people enjoy life more than older people do ? first we may consider indeed that young people enjoy life more than older people do . the mantra of youth could be : life is short , party hard . they are young , they have many time to spend . their behaviour toward life is therefore candide , they have no responsabilities . they think they are able to do whatever they want , even fault , thanks to the fact that they are young . so they enjoy life in their way : overdrinking , overdancing . .. no matter , they are inconscious ! nonetheless , this is a very contemporan phenomenon . for century until the fifty , young should work in the very begining of their life . they were not considered at all a king-child a we do . such a statement should have seemed to everybody aukward : the only period of the life one could have been able to enjoy , if not belonging to the high part of society , wa the elderly when they had enough money to think to someting else than working . nowdays thing are different but i do n't think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . they should enjoy life louder but that 's it . older people have learned to enjoy life differently , for instance by building a family or taking care of it , by enjoying every single moment of what we could call happiness .
