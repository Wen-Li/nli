a car , today , is a necessity for many people . saying that , in twenty year from now , there will be fewer number fo car is not true . cars today have become passion for the people , a status symbol and if someone doe n't own , he or she dream about owning a car . they work hard to achieve their dream . although , many people point out that fossil fuel is getting expensive and we are using it up at a very fast rate . this will lead u to a time , when there will no fossil fuel . but these people are not aware that , a lot of research ha been done to find an alternative fuel . these day , we have car available which do n't run on petrol or diesel but on hydrogen ( known a fuel cell car ) . this fuel ha one more advantage of not polluting our environment . even company have produced car which run on both petrol and electricity ( better known a , hybrid car ) . so , there will be fuel available in future for our car to run . moreover , for most people car have become necessity rather than comfort . people are growing richer due do booming economy and higher pay . so , they love the comfort provided by the car . today 's youngster are , even , more crazy about car . every teenager ha a dream ( either known to him or hidden ) to own a specific car . they will be the consumer of tomorrow . its clear form this fact also that , in future there will be people to buy the car . they may want to show-off or enjoy a ride with love one or go on a long drive to relieve stress but one thing is for sure car will always be in fashion . the number of car will be more in future a compared to today . as evident form the recent news that all the major car making company in the world , like ford , ferrari , toyota etc. , are expanding their production capacity . if more car are being manufactured than they previously were , then how can we expect that there will be a decrease in the number of car in future .
