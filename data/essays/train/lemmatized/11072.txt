in korea , there is a new common thought about korean youg people after the world cup 2002 . most young generation showed positive quality to keep in order , clean up stadium after play , and have a good manner in encouraging . however , it is a picture of one particular period and i do not think it tell that yougsters nowadays are a lot engaged to their community . in other word , i agree with the statement that youngster are not giving much time to help the community for two reason ; they are first of all , young people participate in community only when it is an obligation . for instance , my sister jina , a highschool student , is relcutant to participate in community work . however , the scholls regulates that it is mendatory to do a voluntary work for the community for 10 hour per year , she doe it helplessly . if it is not for school assignment , she never help the community . she say it is such a boring thing to talk with the eldery , clean park , help disabled . second , youngster are too selfish to think about others . especially thesedays , they concentrate to themselves more and more . for example , the educational circumstance are making child to compete . my nephew alice is always top in her class . to be the most elite student , she go to seven differnet extracurriculum academy . she say she ha to be a number one and to be like that , she ha no time to spend on others . in brief , thesedays , the young age are getting more and more selfish by competative atmosphere and spends only a little time to help the community
