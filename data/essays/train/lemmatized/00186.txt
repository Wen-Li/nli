it will be unfair to be on either side of this statement , a both are good in their own context and usage . but , in order to take one option , i will go with having a broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than specializing in one specific subject . as , we are living in a fast paced world where information is passed at high rate and we are rapidly becoming a residant of a global village . i am sure that a person with just a specialized know how of creating new toy for child will not be able to go far if he do n't posse good marketing skill too or a comapny like toyata would have not been so succesfull if it had not able to match it supply and demand , ofcourse simeltaneously . for another example even in one of the most specialized occupation , military it is essential even for a good and strong soldier to diversify himself and have a proper knowledge of his location with respect to his enemy which he can get with the help of new technology like gprs with a primary knowledge to fight and survive , it all about survival of the fittest . it is also very risky for any individual to keep specializing in one field without knowing the scope and growth of that particular field . it is after all the question of surviving in this highly competitve world . even to understand our own interest and strength before specializing in any particular subject we need to diversify u into various academic or real life experience and sometimes by even failing in few venture where we are not strong . so instead of keeping all my egg in one basket i would rather go for various basket before making the choice for the perfect one . i would rather understand various academic subject and will be in a position to effeciently corelate them and that will be more fruitful than specializing in one field .
