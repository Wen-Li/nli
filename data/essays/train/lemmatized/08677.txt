i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are a few reason why . one reason i disagree with the statement is that young people are required to help their community for certain hour . for me , a a middle school student , have to help my community for more than ten hour a year which is a lot for a middle school student . also , to get accepted into college , you need certain hour of community service . another reason is that the young generation ha a culture of donation . donation could be a big help in the community and many young people are donating money to the community . for example , a college student who worked at a part-time job , donated more than half of his hard earned money . also , at school , donation are made by student . my class collected money and donated it to an orphanage nearby , which is helping the community . the last reason is that the meaning of giving enough time to helping the community ha changed . in the old day , there were lot of poor people who needed support from the government and the society . so people back then had to work very hard to help the poor and improve the community . but now , thing have changed . there are not that many poor people in the community and thing to improve . also , back in the old day , skill and technology did n't matter much because there were n't that many high-tech thing to improve in the community . but now , it is different . non-skilled people can not help in the community because everything ha become high-tech , so only people with skill can help the community directly . nowadays , we help our community by donation and during community service hour . these are the reason why i disagree that young people nowadays are no giving enough time to helping their community .
