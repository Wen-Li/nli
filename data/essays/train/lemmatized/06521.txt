intelectual or practical what will be the best for u ? about if it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that is for them to learn fact , i believe learn fact are more important than memorice and idea or a concept because about a fact you can develop and idea or a concept . when we want to develop or introduce an idea or concept we have to demostrate we are in the right position with a fact , without a fact the idea doesnt work . for an example : in some forestal and agricultural school the student learn making with their hand what they should learn , they go to the feel and work that is the way they learn , this is a very way to teach . another example : when we are kindergarden student the person who taking kare about u do not teach u first a concept , they teach u first how to make the thing . in ciences for scientisfhics or a manager in a bussines the fact are more importants than concept , that doesnt mean that concept can not help u , but all we learn at school be really helpful to u just in the time we use this in the real life . so that way i believe that fact are more important that concept and idea , because you can infer and idea because of a fact . how i believe that in some school should be more practical , this way the idea or concept that the school or teacher want we learnd wont be so easy to forget , because with a fact we can remember and important idea , and another thing is having a fact in a class will be make u more interesting the compreention or even teacher can atract the student more than a regular class .
