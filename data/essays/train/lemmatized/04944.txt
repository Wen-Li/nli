although i can imagine reason why people would consider learning of fact a the most important task of student , because in some situation a specific knowledge is a great advantage and all that count , i totaly agree with the statement named above . i do share the opinion that the understanding of general idea and concept is more important for several reason . first , this ability is transferable to many situation and subject . for example even if a person change her major subject of study , it is still possible to use the accomplished knowlege of method and concept in the new subject . on the contrary , the simple fact of the previous study are most of the time no longer usefull . second , human brain are only able to provide a limited number of fact at the same time , so people will not remember detail of fact after a few month or year and need to relearn them anyway . according to my opinion , another reason to judge the learning of fact le important is the current way of living . because of the fast technological development in our century , a reasonable amount of fact which you learn today might be toal useless very quickly . for example some programming language which were commonly used only a few year ago are now not up to date any longer . this technological environment also enables people to get to know specific fact very fast by starting research in the internet , which make the knowldege of fact even le important . but it is necessary to be able to distinguish the quality of web page , which lead again to the argument that a general knowledge is important . because of those reason stated above , i came to the conclusion , that the knowledge of fact is time limited and being capable of using general concept and idea will last longer and are therefore more efficient than fact .
