i do not agree with the statement that say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . we usually travel for different purpose , but when traveling is intended to be just for pleasure , the best way to do it is not in a group led by a tour guide . tours are usually restricted and scheduled , which doe not allow you to stay more day in a place that you liked or visit other thing that you would like to see that are not included in your tour itinerary . the best way to travel is to plan your trip before hand , do some research over the place that you intend to go to , see which are the most appealing attraction and see if you can reserve the hotel room or if possible plan other activity that you know you will be doing . the only situation in which i believe it is a good idea to travel in a group led by a tour guide is if you are visiting the country for the first time or if you know that you will not have the time to do the research before getting to the place . another important factor is the language . usually , when you go to another country most of the time you can do pretty well if you know how to talk in english , but there are some very exotic place in very remote area where this will not be much of an useful tool . in this situation , if you do not know the language spoken in that region , the best thing you can do is to travel with a tour guide . unless you have a very adventurous spirit and would like to have some fun getting lost or getting into very peculiar situation that you can later tell to your grandchild . traveling alone is much more exciting than traveling with a tour guide , but not all people are willing to live such and experience .
