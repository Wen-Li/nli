i personally do not agree with the following statement . today , people are used to live using their car and i do not belive that they can change their habit in only twenty year . for example , i live far from the place i study and to reach the university i drive my car for 30 minute everyday . expecially in italy , where i live , train and bus are not really efficent . people here need the car for living , different way of moving in italy are really not popular . however , i think that in country like japan , where train and bus work well and are always on time , thing might be really different in 20 year . the conciousnes about the fact that pollution is destroing nature and wild-life is higher . anyway , i find that people are usually selfish and absolutely not able to change the world . only few people care about our world and think about the future human and animal will live here . furthermore , i find that governments should be more responisble when this problem is tackled . cars will not be fewer is the country do not give a different way to move to people . tomorrow i have to go to the university and if even i love my country and this world , i will use my car because there are no other way for me to get to the university . twenty year are not enough to change people 's mind . i think that if people start now to use le their car maybe in a century something might be seen , not earlier . anyway , the use of car is still attractive because of the promotion company like bmw , toyota , audi do . cars is still a business , it is still one of the most important business of a country and it is absolutely not easy to change something in people 's mind when there is no interest in the society .
