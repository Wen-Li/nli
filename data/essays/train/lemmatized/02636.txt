when travelling in a group led by a tour guide , one person will feel convenient because the tour guide will arrange the routine and lodging , and can share happiness with different people in the group . however , i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . firstly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide will waste a lot of time on waiting for other people . i once had a trip in a group of 20 people . before visiting a place , everyone wa told to come back in one hour . i came back on time but stayed there for half hour just to wait for those who did n't return punctually . as a result , we had no time to visited another place which interested me . secondly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide will based upon a fixed routine . the routine is arranged not according to the tourist ' interest , but according to the purpose of the travelling agent firm . so during the travelling , we will lose chance to explore new site and routine , which are more attractive . thirdly , travelling in a group led by a wrong tour guide will be a nightmare . if the tour guide just care about money , he will always lead the tourist to some shop where the price are extremely high . in this way , a lot of time will be wasted and a lot of money will be spent on the commodity which do not worth that much . on the other hand , the guide will earn commission from the retailors by taking the tourist into the shop . for example , last year my friend spent usd 100 on a necklace on a travelling in a group led by a tour guide . but the same necklage can be bought at a price of usd 25 in another place .
