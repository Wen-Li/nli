overall i would disagree with this statement , i believe that travelling on an independent basis is more rewarding even if it is more challenging . i usually like to do my homework beforehand about place i want to visit and plan it myself to a certain extent . i am very much interested in the history of place i am visiting a well a the local culture of the inhabitant , therefore i prefer a travel formula that maximises my interacion with these local resident . this planning and interaction with people will enrich the trip many fold versus going with a group led by a tour guide where the information one would receive is prepared and digested and then presented to the traveller . i have travelled to southern spain many year ago , i had planned my trip to a certain extent only and i discovered many location that were not pointed in tourist pamphlet , just by walking down the street and talking to people . this is what i call the surprise effect of trip , see the unexpected by going place not necessarily frequented heavily by tourist , this allows me to interact in a more personal way with local resident of area i am visiting and have a better feel of the life of these people . travelling indepently give me more control over my time , i can manage it the way that work better for me , i can stay longer in a place if i deem necessary , or i can just pack up and leave to `` greener pasture '' if i get bored in a particular location . also there is the financial aspect of it , i find it more cost effective to travel on your own than with a tour guide . i can choose to settle in le expensive hotel and have my own agenda a far a meal are concerned during my trip . of course going on a loner basis may pose some challenge and maybe some risk in certain situation but overall it is a much more interesting and rewarding approach .
