from my point of view , i would say traveling alone is the best way can go and have fun an dnot worry about anything else . traveling alone mean , someone is able to go at there own pace , not worry about others , have a good time , meet others and have an alone time . traveling alone is more relaxing , you have no stress , no on etells you what to do . it 's also a great experience . you learn on your own , it 's always good to have acknowledge other thing . if you were to travel with a group led by a tour guide , it would probably not be a good idea , from my personal expereinces . i wa to go once with my class to a city called jacmel in port - au - prince haiti led by a tour guide . everyone wanted to do something different . people were getting aggrevated at the tour guide , because she wa n't listening to what we wanted to do . but her job wa to show u around , but she wa talking more then showing . it wa n't a great expereince . although , we actually did have a good time together my friend and i , because we were togther an da a class trip that 's what we wanted . fro all the class to go somewhere and saty together . our goal wa accomplished . from my own experience , i disagree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . maybe if i were to travel in a group it would have been different then with a tour guide , because you are to do what a tour guide doe . and personally , i usually hate when someone tell me to do something , i get vexed . traveling alone is a better idea , because of many reason . when traveling alone , you do n't have any responsibility , but only yourself , which is a huge burden of a shoulder . experiencing , visiting , learning alone is great , no one bother you and you do n't get annoyed , and i belive that is a great way to travel , with no stress , it 's all about having a good time , relaxing and having no worry .
