in my opinion today it is more important to specialize in one specific subject . each field of science ha developed very fast and branched out widely during the last 100 year . today it is not even possible to have knowledge about each part of a scientific area . for example the area of physic can be devided into hundred of different part . there is the research of atomic behaviour in contrast to the research of force that influence movement in our universe . each new invention that humanitiy make becomes more and more complex so that even one single person ca n't undestand all of it . so it is important to specialize in one subject . on the other side a point for a broad knowledge is that all this specific knowledge ha to be combined to become an efficient solution . by remaining in the scientific field of physic it can be mentioned that result that came up in atomic research have big influence to research on the whole universe . thus there ha to be a person who recognizes relationship between to diffrent area of research . the problem occuring with this contradictionary idea is that there ha to be one part of people who have to specialize and another part that posse a broad knowledge to have an overview over all field of research . so by choosing the major subject at a university it is evident that the student know in which position he want to work in his or her later life . will he or she go very far into detail of a subject or more have an overview about a subject . thus at the end i have to conclude that there ca n't be a `` yes '' or `` no '' on the statement . it depends on what the person who ha to decide like better . taking a job with caractaristics of leadership , then decide for broad knowledge . choosing more scientific detailed work then it is better to have a specific knowledge .
