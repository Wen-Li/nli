i think that trying new thing and taking risk is an important factor in becoming a successful person . to argue such an opinion first one ha to decide for himself his understanding of success . after all , there are many field in life in which a person may be successful : a a parent , a an employee , a a student etc . but in each of these area one will see that when carried out reasonably , attempting new thing and taking risk doe increase success , becuase it broadens our ability and perspective . today , we are in an age where the progress of thing and development around u happen at a much faster rate than they did in the past . this observation ha been made by many people including writer , scientist and socialogists . the rate of change around u is constantly increasing . these change include technological progress a well a the characteristic of society . all of these in my opinion make it inevitable that each individual ha to renew themselves and stay up to date with the rapid progress around them both socially and professionally . otherwise one easily fall behind and because of this may face hardship . for example , a doctor will achieve limited success through time if she confines herself to medical technique that she already know . however a successful doctor should also be in a constant search for new technique , new way and new knowledge . it is also seen in all social relationship , that the side often have to renew themselves personally and try new thing , especially when there is a question of having to compromise . problems in friendship ca n't be solved if the party are n't willing change their behaviour at time . even in our everyday life , we become tired of doing the same thing and therefore try new thing and take risk . otherwise one would go insane living a routine , robotic life . as a result i think trying new thing is an imprtant part o
