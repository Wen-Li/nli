i disagree with the statement because it is not allways true . infact there are many young people that do not know the real meaning of `` enjoy life '' . they like drink alchool and smoke or take drug . this two thing are all that they would like to enjoy their life . but i know many old people that know what it is the felicity . firstly they appreciate the slowly of life , the kindness and the importance of friend . they know the meaning of drink a tea whit friend . also they can dancing an walking like nobody know . lastly they know the meaning of life , but if it is not true anyway they will know how enjoy their life ! according to a magazine in the future there will more old people than young people . i think that it will be good because if the old people know how enjoy life , all the world will be happy . there are , also , a lot of cultural difference between people . for this reason it is impossible to know how the world will be . if you have a zero cultural backgound and you live in a country you will know the felicity , but if you have a kind knowledge that it is not complete you will unhappy . in both of this two example you do not know your grade of happyness
