i concede with the point of view , that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agree , that student have to learn a lot of hard fact to gain a substantial basis of knowledge . with this gained `` ground-knowledge '' they are able to work in their specific community or surrounding . every science ha it specific speech and skill that are known by everyone in that community . but to be able to cope with task , that student will be faced in their professional and private life , it is important , that they do understand the idea that are behind the fact . to point it out , knowledge by hard and learned fact is not sustainable , because you can forget part of the fact . in this case the student is not able any more to overview the whole issue . that mean , a student who understands the idea and concept behind the fact is able to cope with new task , that will emerge . the student is more prepared if he can adopt the idea and concept . with the idea he can create new solution . in addition it is much easier to forget fact rather than idea and concept . to understand mean , that a student is more open to new issue , than a student who can just recall his learned fact . also the time , that is spent by student to learn the fact by hard is le effective than to learn the concept . to understand mean also to gain tacit knowledge , that is in your hard and not codified . facts are codified , for instance in book or standard . but if a student understand the idea and concept , he is able to gain tacit knowledge , that is just owned by him and singular . in conclusion it is more effective to understand the concept behind the fact , because it make a student better prepared for situation that suddenly occur . in mz opinion it is really important to be prepared to handle with siisues , that are nor commonly known and therefor the best a student can do is to achieve the knowledge how to do something . i am c
