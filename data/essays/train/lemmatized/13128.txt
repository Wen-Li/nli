as far a i am concerned , i neither agree or disagree with the statement above . so far , both considered approach are okay to me . it depends on different aspect , which way is much better . i am going to describe some aspect and some base information , how everyone should decide in term of `` broad knowledge of many acadamic subject '' versus `` specialize in one subject '' . at first , everbody should make sure , what kind of future career aspiration they tend to have . therefore , you should ask yourself the following two question : - do you want to become an expert in one specific subject or knowledge area ? - or do you prefere to become a generalist ( person , who know many different thing about different subject - but majorly on a high level basis ) over some different subject without a deep knowledge in detail ? if people are able to answer these question , it should be quite straight-forward to find a solution on an individual basis . if you want to become an expert in a specific area , you should focus on one or perhaps even two ( but not more ! ) subject and drive yourself into an expert role among your peer over the year of study . if you want to become a generalisit , you should study several subject to approach a wide horizont of knowlege . unfortunately , at the beginning of a study , many student are unsure what direction they should prefere . in this situation , i am going to recommend to make following choice : as long a student are able to keep the generalist role without the need for specializing , student should try to get into different acadamic subject in order to find out , what is the best approach for each of them . if student are going to choose this way , they have to be aware about time management . if student tend just `` to study around '' plus loosing time and no learning plan , they are going to have a disadvantage during application for a job . recruiting department of company ask applicant about the length of their study time . if there is an answer with no target direction , it is very hard to get a job .
