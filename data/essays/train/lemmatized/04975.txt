there are many advertisement that is made for many thing . car , food , toy , company and etc . us regular people who watch these advertisement defenetly grab our attention making u buy the product or use it . as my opinion i think product that are advertised do look better than what they really are for many reason . many food commercial make the product look very tasty juicy and big . they also add special effect that make it look even better . but truth is that it just an average food that people eat . many fast food restraunt try to attract a many costumer a possible inorder to sell more product a much a possible . in my experience i once went to a restraunt because the commerical looked very good . as soon a i get there the food looked totally different from the commercial and it did n't taste a good a i thought it would be by watching the ad . secondly many adverstisements use celebrity . many people are attracted to this because many will think if this celebrity is using this product it must be amazing . people tends to lured in to this trap . i also have an similar experience that i faced when i wa a little boy . i loved to play baseball and my favorite baseball player wa mike piazza . one day i saw a commercial about him using a bat . he say that this is the best bat that i 've ever used in mu life . i chose to buy this bat with out any doubt in my mind . but i find out that the quality of the bat wa very bad . lastly , many company use professional to advertise their product . many professional advertiser use their word and exageration to catch the customer attention . oxy-clean for example wa an product that wa said that it 'll get rid of every dirt and stain possible . on commerical they showed that it really do work . but after you try the product you 'll see that the product doe not have the same outcome a on television . most product are usually much better than it really is . many company try to trick the customer by making exagerations and special effect on the commercial so people will buy their product . the truth is that it not a good a it on advertisement . as you can see i agree to the statement because of the reason above
