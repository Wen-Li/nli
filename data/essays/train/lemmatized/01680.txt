i partially disagree with the statement that `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . because according to my view most of the student can gain knowledge by learning the fact practically and i belive the principle `` practice make man perfect '' this proverb say that by learning the fact that is practical experience will lead a sucessfull life . suppose if a medico student who newly enters into his field he may not have an perfect idea how to treat the patient and the patient may lost his life in such condition the doctor or medico student should not get depresed and shouldnot give up his job , if he do that then he is unfit for his profesional field . during such sort of condition he should be very sprotive and should learn the fact . so that he may not repeat the mistke next time . and i partially disagree with the statement that it is important for student to understand idea , because each and every aspect we can not learn by facing the practical experience , so by reading good book which contains the history of succesfull person like famous writer , politician , social worker etc we will get and clear idea and concept so that student lead their lifein a successfull way . by the understanding the idea , concept and leaniong fact will help the student to build up his career in better field . attitude + creativity + talent = success of student so due to the above reason i partially disagree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
