these day le and le young people attend their community-meetings . and i storngly agree with the idea . young people who do not spend time to help their community have some reason . first , they do not know the importance their community . although they depend their life upon them , they do not notice the fact . because of it they think they do not have to wast their time to help their community . second , there are a lot of much more attractive thing than working for their community around them . for example they want to spend their time to work for their part time job rather than to work for their community . it is because of their benefit . that is , even if they work for their community hard they can not get money . so they decide to spend their time more attractive thing . all in all , a i said above , nowadays they think they do n't want to spend thier time to help their community .
