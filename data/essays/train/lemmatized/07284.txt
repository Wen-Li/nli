to some extent there is need for broad knowledge of many academic subject , but finally one shold master only one specific subject to do great in their carrers . a person having broder knowledge will serve better for sometimes because the thing he learned from one subject can be carried over to other . he can easily relate thing since he already been this . but if someone who really serious about there carrers , will choose to master a specific subject than going through all the subject . in this way he will develop his interest and there by he can carry on this , he can do reaserch on wht he ha selected , there by he can give new dimensions to theold traditnal way . it will also help him , in his carrer where he can earn more than others do because he ha more knowledge about that subject and because he can do thing in more efficient way . consentrating one one subject also reduces the confusion and he can see what he want in more precised way . lets consider a a academic student of higher school , he ha more subject to learn then student who is doing masters . but he ha that knowledge in limited spetrum . where a student of graduation or pg . will learn or concentrate on one particular subject , and he get thorugh knowledge of waht is happened , what is happeining and what wiil be ? student on completion wil get highly paid job , in his field rather one doe n't have more specific knowledge . students should concentare on specific sbject which will lead to more practicallity of applying thing . mastering specific subject will lead to more application of what is been learned all these year . it will also develop students attitude towards that subject will inturn get huge benefit . so , in my opinion student should have basic knowledge all the subject but he should have more knowledge on specific subject which will serve him better and his society .
