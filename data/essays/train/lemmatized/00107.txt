this statement is true and false at the same time . first of all , young people are interested in their own life and how to make it better for them . for instance , a high school graduate will focus on attending college and afterwards taking a job and make a family . he wo n't care about a social problem in his society and will say : `` i must focus on my own life . i do n't have time for these thing '' . second , in most of young people , they tend to have fun instead of working very hard . to illustrate , a high-school student who get a summer holiday will think primarily about how to make it enjoyable . he think about travelling abroad or going to beach . he wo n't usually think about giving some of his allowance to a charity organization . but , however , it doe n't apply for each individual person or community . nowadays , a lot of youth support charity organization . for example , in saudi arabia , a lot of youth support the charity organization with money . thus , satisfying the demand of poor family in saudi arabia . another example is , in ramadan ( the season of fasting for saudis ) , there are a lot of youth providing date and water to the driver in the traffic sign in order to break their fast . in conclusion , generally speaking , this statement is true although it can not be applied on each individual young person .
