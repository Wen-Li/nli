i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . the following explanation shall provide the basis for my opinion that older people enjoy life more than young people do . young people often seem to be happy and cheerful . they participate in a lot of activity , are often around other people and enjoy their leisure time with exciting thing . older people often stay at home , do not have many different activity in their daily life and seem to be le excited . the above statement decribe the surface of what the life of these two group of society is like . in my opinion it is more important to take a look under the surface and to find out about the mental state of these people . young people often find themselves being put under pressure . life for them is very difficult . they are growing up and their environment and their own attitude and opinion change very quickly . it is difficult for young people to take decision and to be strong . this lead to a variety of mechanism of self-protection , which often imply an activity-oriented life . for example , many young people often go to party . they seem to be enjoying life a much a possible . however , they are often just taking a break from their stressful life , but are still not able to truly enjoy their life . they are not truly relaxed and happy , bcause they are not really doing what is best for them . older people have mostly passed this phase of doubt and difficulty . they show a more relaxed attitude towards life and it surprising turn . this group of the society know that mistake are made and wrong decision happen , and have learned to take everything easier . moreover , older people to not let themselves be put under pressure by other people or circumstance . they show the ability to take more decision in their own interest and to know what they want for their life . for example , they do not go out to party a much a young people do . they know better that activity including a more personal social contact is worth more than just pushing away their problem . older people are choosing their best opportunity for life and enjoy them . the above paragraph argue my opinion that older people enjoy life more than young people do .
