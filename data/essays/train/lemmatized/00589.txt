i totally agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . no matter if people are successful in their carreer or in sport , they probably have made the experience that without trying something new and putting something at risk nothing will change . success is a process not a static thing . success will happen just in a frame of time . for example a product , let say a mobile phone . the first series of mobile had appeared year ago . they had been a great success for nokia , siemens etc . but if this company did invest in research to invent new feature , better technology , the product mobile phone would not be interesting until now , because after a certain amount of time everyone would have owned a mobile and this company would be nor more successfull . this point bolster the statement that success come with trying new thing . that people have to take risk is also very good shown by people who are very successful in sport . for example ski flyer . they have to improve their technique every time . trainers try to achieve better result of them in teaching them new method , inventing new material . if this sportsman would just rely on what they did last season how could it be possible that every year the result are new high score and record . on the other hand trying out new thins also risk their ability to win . in conclusion i would like to say that people that are successful are aware of the fact that there is a need for development and risk for every single success . a famous statement say that the success will not come following the mass to the sea but looking for the spring . thats what the point is , you have to walk on individual pathes and not on the pathes of somebody else .
