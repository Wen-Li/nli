i think young people do not give enough time to helping their community . there are three reason why i can say so . first , the connection between people in our society ha been getting weaker these day in japan . therefore , it doe not seem that we have to pay attention to the community any more . about 40 or 50 year ago , the connection between people in the community wa very strong . because there are le people in one community , almost all the member of community knew each other . children wa scold by other child 's parent if they behaved badly . so , young people thought they were nurtred and educated by the community . therefore they tended to think that they had to return something for the community . however , we do not even know the member of our community , because there are too many people in one community . we do not even greet each other . so young people can not think `` we are here because of the good community '' . this is the first reason why young people do not give enough time to helping their community . the second reason is that young people spend more time for themselves than they used to do . we have a lot of entertainment and attractive thing in the world nowadays . some want to see rock musician , others want to see baseball game . in addition , we can do most of thing without anybody 's help in the community . althogh some young people are helping their community by volunteering . however , now it ha been work for their own purpose . many university and company admit student ' volunteer experience a their `` evidence of good personality and social skill '' so , these volunteer work are done for their own rather than the community . most of young people may not do volunteer work after they enter the university or company . this is why i think young people do not give enough time to helping their community .
