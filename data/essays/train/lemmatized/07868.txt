there are many possibility for young people to help their community . they could engage in policy , give sport lesson , take part in the red cross or be active in their church . but , in fact , there are quite few people who actually do some of these thing . what are the reason for this ? one point could be that young people feel little responsibility for their community . they have to think so much about themselves , about how to plan their life and how to organize their career , that thinking about others seems not to fit in . they just live according to the sentence `` if everybody think of themselves , it is thought of everybody '' . one should not call all of them unfair , some of them are simply overwhelmed by all the thing they have to manage in their own life , so that they can not concentrate on others . and for some of them there simply is not much time to engage for other thing than for school or for university . many student i know have to work very hard to be successful in their field of study , so that there is only little time to concentrate on other thing . the time they have , they prefer using to meet friend or just to relax . on the other hand , not engaging in one community is , of course , very comfortable . knowing that there are people who do the work make many people think : `` well , why me if they do it so well ? '' and one may not forget that for many people there is not much that they regard to be worth to engage for . most young people in our society live quite well , they have chance for their future , the society they live in is shaped by a stable democracy . why fighting or engaging for something if everything seems alright ? another point i consider to be influencing is , that many young people would like to engage in their community , but they just do not know how or who to ask . perhaps approaching student and proposing possibility would make them think about getting active in their community . on the other hand , one should not forget all the young people who really sacrifice much time and nerve to serve their community . there are always people engaging in a school or in different club who offer their talent and also their time for so many other people . so one should not forget to regard the stament in an appropriate way .
