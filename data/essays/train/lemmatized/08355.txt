in the same way that people from different culture enjoy life in different way , i am convinced that older people can enjoy life just a much a younger people do . however , older people enjoy different thing in life . first , i believe that people change their definition of happiness a they grow older . while young people would most likely associate the thought of enjoying life with the practice of physical activity , or a busy nightlife , i am tempted to believe that older people would tend to relate enjoyment to more intellectual activitites such a reading , writing , or any artistic activity . second , older people have financial resource that allow them to do thing that they were not able to do when they were younger . for instance , older people generally have a more significant budget to travel all over the world . i can still remember spending entire summer working in construction in order to pay for my extra-curricular activites during the academic year . now , i have the ability to take several week off and spend all my time traveling to foreign country . finally , i am convinced that you only enjoy life once you really understand it value . older people have more experience , and understand the value of friendship , community and other thing that make anyone 's life enjoyable . i would argue that younger people do not always have the same ability to step back and enjoy what they have in the than older people . i remember that i would only care about sport while i wa in high school . although the feeling of being a performant athlete provided many opportunity to enjoy life , i look at it differently now . when i think about these time , i think about how i could have enjoyed this experience more thoroughly if i had been more mature . in conclusion , i would strongly argue that older people can enjoy just a much a young people do . it is just a matter of defining your expectation from life , and having the ablity to understand your own happiness .
