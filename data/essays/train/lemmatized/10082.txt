i do not agree with the statement . we need advertisement in our life . we are live in the modern era , through advertisement , we can know what the world is going on . and the manufactory also need through the advertisement let the poeple know their product . first , manufacture need let the people know their product , and the advertisement are the best way to present their product . for example , i wanted to buy a new car last year , but there were so many kind of car in the market . how could i choose a good one ? i just opened the newspaper to look for the classification . i found the nissan is the best one to meet my need that included safety and also can save a lot of gas which compared to other brand car . so i chose nissan , and i drive it for a year it really good . through advertisement i save time , and also save money . the other reason we need the ad . is because people need to know where to find the product they need . i always look for adervtisement to find where to find the latest product . such a the lancome product , i like this name product very much , and they always have new product come . so through the ad . i can get the latest product to use . it is true , there are some of the producer misuse the advertisement to cheat people . but that is not from long term running , people will know it after they use it . so that is mean this kind of performance will not last longer . from all above , the manufacture need to find a best way to show their product , and people can use the advertisement to find the thing they need . advertisementcan save time , and get good result .
