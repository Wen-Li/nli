i agree this statement . young people are too lazy to help people nowdays , although we sing : `` stand hand in hand '' everyday in school . young people nowdays are getting more and more selfish . we can hardly see a young person helping a old granny to cross the road nowdays , because we prefer chating with friend beside the road . i do not really know south african young people 's behaviour , but i know young people in china very well . of cousre , not all of u are selfish and unconsidering , but the majority of the youth are selfish . they are everywhere , in the school , on the street and even just in our family . unfortunately , i think that i am one of them too . i remember when i wa in the school of china . we need to do the daily cleaning everyday by ourselves , because that wa and still is the part of our school duty . class teacher divided u into several group , and told u the date that we would be on duty . we want a nice and clear environment to study , although we do not want to do the cleaning by ourselves . therefore we expected the other people could work harder to get the classroom clean . but , other people also thought that way . so , a you can imagine , we all worked not hard eough . therefore , the next day we had a untidy , dirty classroom . people who had duty on that day might think that : they did not do the cleaning well , so why should i ? therefore , the next day we had a untidy , dirty classroom again . then it just carried on like this , so we never had a clear classroom ! that look ridiculous , but that wa exactly what happen . that is all about selfishness . young people are just like that , pushing the duty to the others . then the others will push them to someone else . we just can not understand that if we help the others , they will help u oneday , when we are expriencing difficulty . young people nowdays do have enough time to helping their community , but they just do not want to give it .
