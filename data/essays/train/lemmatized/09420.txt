i dont believe that in twenty year from now there will be le car than there are today . as we can see around u that it seems there is a deluge of car and other mode of vehicle . it seems that everybody want to own a car a it ha become a matter of status symbol and a nessecity . as the world economy is getting stronger with each passing day and develping country turning into developed one , the financial capability of lay person ha improved a lot . so they can spend on thing of luxury such a car . another reason to believe that number of car will only increase from here on and not decline is that today it is not difficult to obtain loan to buy a car , all the leading bank are willing to shell money out of there coffer to entice customer to get a car . although some people are driven by the thought that rising fuel price and depleting fuel stock will ultimately apply brake on number of car a people will not be able to buy fuel and in about next twenty year petroleum reserve will be exausted . but i do n't think this will happen a scientist are working on prepring biofuel which will cost le and will last for greater time and i have a good example of this study a some of my friend prepared biofuel from jatropha plant and with the help of this fuel they ran an engine . with each passing day the price of car are slashed and new comfort are added so people think that they should go for it and own a car . as in most of the country the public transport system is very tiring and there is such a great rush of people that now people have started to use there own vehicle for commuting and this urge will lead to more car . hence i disagree that number of car will decrease from now onwards . but according to me it should increase .
