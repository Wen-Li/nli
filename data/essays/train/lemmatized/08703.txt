the main purpose of the advertisement is not only make customer to understand product but also make product look nicer and better . thus , i totally agree with the following statement . all people would have experienced the power of the advertisement a lot of time . i have a few example to support my idea . when i go to the mall , i see the new product each time . one of them is cell phone . i watch the tv almost everyday , mostly advertisement , i see the new cell phone everytime . so many ability of cell phone lured me to buy it , such a camera , mp3 , recorder , mirror , and walky talky . although i thought i will going to use it for sure , i did not use those ability not much a i thought i would . because those ability were le than i expected . i will buy digital camera rather than camera phone , mp3 player rather than mp3 phone . i wa lured by watching advertisement . i did not see the inside of cell phone but only believed in my vision . everytime i go to watch movie , i always decided to see the movie that ha interesting poster , or ha interesting short scene from the advertisement . there are so many time that i regreted . i realized that advertisement are important a much a quality of the product . i would not think that movie can not success without the advertisement . the purpose of the advertisement is lure customer . there are people make interesting advertisement , and that 's what they are for ; make it look better and nicer . the market of the advertisement is growing , sometime company spend a lot of money to make best advertisement rather than make better quality . however , we need to be warned before we purchase the product a well a understading the product .
