here are some of funny thing now . some one think young people enjoy life more than older people do . others do not support it . in the following , here give my own opinion about the topic . obviously , it is a hard question to speak . in my opinion , it all depands . yonug people are always energetic . enjoy life to them is do playing . they can do mang cool thing that the older can not take , such a playing tense game , travelling to many beautiful palces away from hometown . in short , they have the ability to take part in physical working thing , which is not available to the older . now , whether the older is not enjoy the life ? the key make sure that is wrong . compare with young 's energy , the older would not have any advantage . though thus , fortunately , there is one thing that the young must have not : the memory . in the older 's childhood , lacking of morden instrument , there is no computer , no colorful tv set , no abundant money to live a good life , even no money to live . all that they experienced is rather uneasy . it must be the most important memory in their whole life . now living in the peaceful and rich life , both can not image when they were child , come to be the turth . finally , here is an example . my grandma , grangpa , father , mother , sisterand me together to chat with each others . in god we trust , this is the most wonderful memory in my opinion that we are happy to talk . ilove my country , my parent , my friend , many thing i want is just we can be together , then make a good lie to our no matter what happen untill we aer die . that is all . thank you .
