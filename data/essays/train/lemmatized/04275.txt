according to my point of view , learning fact is important for student a well a learning concept and idea . indeed , they are the two side of the same icon , let 's say `` the learning icon '' , because fact show that concept and idea are right or wrong in the real world . in addition , they show how different idea can be interconnected or influenced by each other and provide an effective way to make a concept understandable . concepts and idea must be learnt , but how to verify them ? physics is a very important example . you can learn much about physic by reading a book and solving mathematical equation . but how to show that all the learnt knowledge is right and applicable ? you need to know about experiment which show the constraint of your theory , therefore you need to `` learn fact '' . then , fact are important to teach how different concept and idea are related . think about mechanical science , for example . there are many concept , often coming from other different field . students can learn them but how they can truly understand how a system work without studying a machine which is an application of all those idea and therefore a fact by definition ? finally , let me highlight that fact have always provided an effective way to understand a concept or an idea . einstein wa very famous for many funny example which he used to explain his own theory . another example is informatics . if you want to learn informatics , i am sure you will be told that you can compare a processor to a brain , a folder to a desk where you store paper and document and so on . summarizing , it is my firm opinion that fact are necessary for an effective learning . you need them to verify theory , to explain how many concept are related and to provide example for a better understanding . a famous statement is that history , here fact , is a great life teacher
