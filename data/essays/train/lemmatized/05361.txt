is is often said that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . for example , a business person that ha an expanding and growing company will probadly diversify his activity and explore new area . the background of this scenery is a feeling of confidence . once you can prove to yourself and to others , what you are capable of then appoval is no longer at stake . you do n't have make a statement on your capacity and inteligence , you have already done that . now it is time for the next goal . and in this line , ambition play a very important part . human being have a tendency to be unsatisfied . once you have reached an aim , another emerges . as soon a you realise that you were able to do what you had set your mind and spirit to , the following project come along . this is a way of maintaining your self steem a high a possible . always looking for self realisation on the outside world . however positive project are in a person 's life , i believe that other thing should be taken into account aswell . for instance , being able to enjoy what you have produced . if you are an important congress man , it is my opinion that before running for president you make the most out of what you are living and feel proud of what you have already accomplished . moreover , there ha to be a stop in the race for constant success . otherwise you might be spending most of your time analysing new project rather than recognising your achievement . if you were able to buy a beautiful house thanks to your dedication and hard work , my advice would be to enjoy it and share time with your family instead of working even harder to purchase a bigger one . all in all , it is my personal opinion that there should be a balance between new aim and enjoying those already met . in order to be successful you have to be able to feel happy with what you have .
