there are some people saying that there will be more car in the future than today , because the car is convenient for ourlife and it save our time . but others say that in the 20 year after there will be small amount of car than now , because the energy is running out and the car is no more can work . these two opinion are reasonable , but i agree the latter opinion . firstly , there is lesser and lesser petroleum the energy source of car . but those kind of resource are limited and someday it will be runned out . then , the car can not work any more without constituting the energy source . but within the 20 year it will be impossible to develop and commercialize the new energy source . secondly , there are many regulation and consensus about prohibiting the air popplliution . the main source of air pollution is came from the car diving . it will be more and more lessened to use car all over the worled . thirdly , the traffic is so busy . there are limted road available which the car can go . but it is overcrowded day by day . as a result , the government construct many different transportation system , such a railroad , bus , and subway , which reduce the road traffic . in city , at rush hour , traffic cause many people to waste their time on the road . it result inefficiency to their work and everyday life . in conclusion , in twenty year , the car will be used little than today . because , there is little resource to run the car , the car produce much polution which is regulated all over the world , and the traffic is so serious that the people use other transportation system than choose car .
