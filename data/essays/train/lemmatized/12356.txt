whats is more important for the student ? understand idea and concept or learn fact ? so , which of these statment do toy agree with ? in my opinion , i think it better for the student to understand idea and concept more than learnning fact , because when the student understand idea and concept this will help him or her to understand and learn fact clearly and better , for example , the earth go around the sun and around it self , this is a fact , but the student should know what happen when the earth go around the sun and around it self , so he should understand that when son go around the som that will make the 4 sesons , and when the earth go around it self this will make the day and the night . and i think if the student should just learn the fact , the student will stop studying and learning when he or she know all the fact , because we all know that the fact are countable . understand idea and concept is the way to find a fact , ( or new fact ) for example , there is a physical rule sad , to the car fast for example you should divide the distance that the car finished on the time that it took it to finish this distance , fast = distance / time , so this rule is a fact , and we could not find this fact unless we would have understod the idea the concept of this rule , so i think it very important to learn fact , but it is more important to understand idea and concept to make everything clearly for the student .
