i would not fully agree on the comment that younger people enjoy live more than older people do , i think younger people enjoy life in a different way than older people do it . for the young generation everything ha to be harder , bigger and faster . they want to be entertained and are looking for new exciting activity . old people are happy with life a it is . they do not need to be entertained anylonger . they had fun when they were young and do not need such activity anymore . but a problem which oftens appers , is that the two different generation do not understand each other . the old people had a really different situation when they were young than the child today and so they can not understand a lot of thing the young generation is doing today . it is the same with the young generation . they are young and do not understand the way old people live . they think it is boring and that those people never had fun . but thats wrong they had fun when they were young and they had fun on their way , they did what people did in that time and now the time ha changed and the young people do what young people do today to have fun . so you can not say that young people enjoy life more than old people . the only thing you could compare is if young people 50 year ago enjoyed life more than young people today but you can not compare old and young people . old people have been young and young people will old one day .
