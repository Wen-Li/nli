celebrated historian , arnold toynbee , said that for civilization to flourish the ` creative minority ' need to solve the problem faced by the civilization . if they are successful in doing so , the civilization continues or else it disintegrates . a problem is now being faced by our society , that of energy crisis and environmental pollution . our enrgy resource are depleting and are environmental problem like global warming are increasing . i firmly beleive that a solution to this problem need to be found for our world to progress . and the solution is : lessening energy consumption where ever possible . that is why i agree with the statement : ` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . ' countries have already set out on the path to reducing the number of car on road and promoting mass transit . this ha a lot of benifits . less traffic , lesser pollution , faster trasnportation , etc . day by day people are awakening to the realisation that something need to be done about the current situation of our transportation . legislations have also come in place in some country , for example the extra tax that is levied on car in singapore almost eliminates the option of buying car for some people and so they have to resort to mean of mass transportation . in some country you are encouraged to ` car-pool ' , which is nothing but sharing your car with your colleague or people who have to reach the same place a you have to . so there is definitely and trend that is emerging here , that of reducing the number of car on road . and a i see it almost every part of the world is working to achieve the benefit that are afforded by implementing strategy that reduce the number of car on road and keep the people happy . that is why i believe that in 20 year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
