in my opinion the statement is true . actually everybody should have a wide knowledge of a lot of academic subject than to specialize in only one field . first , if you have a wider knowledge it will use yourself a lot because it support you in the admission for the university or in a future job . a lot of people will know after talking to others if somebody ha a wider knowledge or not . and if you have an interview for a job or an admission interview at university , your knowledge can lead you to your goal a good job or admission . second if you have a good knowledge you can understand much more subject and world problem than if you would not have it . and that will make your world more interesting . also can you assist by question from your friend , parent or relative and that give you more self confidence and make you more and more a respected partner . also will it develop your logical thinking and this point will lead to a greater knowledge again . futhermore , a good and wide knowledge will rest you a live time . and i think the more and more people learn and know about academic subject , there life becomes more interesting and they will also discover new interestings . like the museum , theatre , read the newspaper , book etc . this will make your world more colourful a if you only would live in your four wall , with your sole specialized subject . what if you will meet other people who do not know anything about your specific subject , which interesting discussion can you lead . to sum up , i prefer having a broad knowledge of many academic skill than just be specialized only in one specific academic subject . i think it is the better way to lead your life . because your knowledge can help you anywhere and in any situation .
