some people believe that the best way to travel is to go alone a they can spend time a they want . but i strongly believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . in this discussion i shall present argument supporting my opinion . there are so many advantage for a guided tour . first and the most important advantage is , a tour guide know the place better than u . so he/she can take u directly to the popular place that should be visited in that city . this really save a lot of time , which is an important thing to be considered in a short vacation and also we will not miss any good place if we have a guide . whereas in the situation where there is no guide , we have to enquire about the place to visit and sometimes we may even get lost in the process of finding the route which result in the wastage of time . second , a the tour guide know about that place , he will be able to explain the history of that place . for example , he can explain the reason or story behind the construction of a monument or sculpture . sometimes they also know about the native story that were not written in the book . in a tour with out guide , we will surely miss all this information . finally , travelling in group also help in many way like a guided tour . first of all , it is fun to travel with so many people and it give u a chance to make new friend . also , the other member in the group will help u when we have a sudden emergency like health problem . in contrast , if we travel alone nobody will be there to take care of u in the new place where everybody is unknown for u . to conclude , while there are argument that can be made on both side , i personally believe that travel in a group with a guide is better compared to travel alone with out a guide .
