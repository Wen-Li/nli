i think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first , with the big developmemt of the technology traveling will be easier than tose day . actually with plane , train , and car people can be in their country at the time they want . so if we return for twenty year ago we 'll see how the people were travel in the past . there were n't car or train so they took day and month in traveling , for example , they used animal camel , horse and also donkey . but now they used car and plane so they saw that the life became more better than before . as we see , in the future people will try to make their traveling more easier than now . i think that they will discover new machine which is faster than the car . they 'll try to get their life more easy and comfort . may be they will try new train which connect the word together from west to the east . in addition what will happen if thae car fill all the street in one city ? it will cause many problem for example polluiton on the air . as aconclusion , in my opinion in the future there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
