i t very important for the education system to theach qualified and student but a conflict will occur when a teacher choose her/him teacing tool . it is the war between theory , understant the idea and concept , and practical information , learning fact . if i have to support one side of this war , my preference will be the learning fact . there are a lot of reason to be agree with the supporter of importance og learning fact , learning with the practical information and experience . if a student know how to use her/his new idea and concept in the real world , he/she will learn and apply quickly in to the real life . because it is very convenient and excited for the student to use new idea and concept . i have a spesific experience for this , i had two chemical teacher when i wa at the high school . one of my teacher were giving u experimentalm assignment a a homework and do the experiment in the school also so i can easiliy remember what we did durung that semester but my chemical theacher will retired and other new theacher came to teach u for the previous season , she just gave formula and feature of the element but i can not imagine anything i completely fotgot the everything what she discus . i suppose a time passing my second unexperinced teacher wa changed and saw the power of the practical information .
