i do n't agree completely with the statement . i do n't believe that in order to be successful people have to take risk or try new experience . i mean , it would be more correct saying that these kind of people are brave , but i really rather not to use the word `` successful '' . let me explain myself : it is extremely complicated to define what doe it mean being a successful person , people have such different goal and perspective in life that there is n't a clear definition of the term ! i can feel that i made it or that i am extremely successful for something that maybe would be seen a a total disaster from someone else 's view . so , i guess i admire both people who are always trying to make change or experience new practice , and also , on the other hand , i truly respect those who feel much more confortable and self secure by repeting thing they already know . however , i must confess . .. i think i am more a `` new risk every day '' type of woman ! i love to feel the emotion when i do n't figure out what am i doing or i try all my best when it come to dealing with new circumstance . so , that is probably another reason why i do n't see a successful people who try new thing : because i do n't see myself that way , using the word `` successful '' . maybe sometimes i wish i wa wiser , more traditional and not afraid of everyday routine !
