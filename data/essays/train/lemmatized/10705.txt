according to me , ideas and concept form the base for successful understanding of a subject . facts are also important for subject like history or biology . but having knowledge only of fact , student can not fetch much . facts can be developed if a student posse an understanding of idea and fact . there are many daily life example that would differentiate the importance between both . for example , let u consider a pocelin flower vase that is placed on a table at one corner of the house , a child may break it though hearing the fact that the porcelin would break . but , if a child ha the idea regarding the product , if he ha a knowledge about the charecteristics of porcelin then he would never break it . unless and until something happens accidentally . if student posse a background knowledge about a product or anything they would handle it with care . having knowledge of ideas and concept would help student in their research work . with idea and concept they can enhance the existing theory and develop a new theory . fact are also important but possessing fact alone cant help student enhance an existing theory . having knowlede of fact hold good for subject like history and political science . these are the subject where date have to be remembered . when talking about other subject like computer science , it is necessary that student posse idead and concept about the subject . for example when a team is woking on a project ( each person allocated different job ) and suppose a person leaf suddenly then it becomes the responsibility of the rest of the team to complete the project . this can be done if the student posse idea and concept regarding that part of the project whick is left by a person . hence the above reason hold good in convaying that fact are important but idea and concept are important ,
