many old people think that they do not enjoy life a the did when they were younger and they generalize this opinion to hold that young people ejoy life more . i do not completely disagree with this statement . particularly , i think it is not that young people enjoy life more , but they enjoy it in a different way . usually , young people do not know much about adult responsabilities yet . this is why they can feel more secure and to feel they have a lot of time to modify thing and attitutes . besides , a feature of young people , especially teenager , is the way feeling are taken to exagerated extreme ; they love or hate , but there is no in between . as they do love , it is a fact that teenager can also suffer a lot . it is well known how easily problem come up when we are young . tiny problem can be a complete tragedy in minute . on the contrary , older people can see these problem jus a superficial , and they are more likely to enjoy of basic thing of life . for example , a bad experience in a new group of people such a class can make a young person quit and to think that he or she will not join this group never again . from another perspective , someone that had experience that this kind of situation can happen ( and will happen ) many time in life , will accept it to summarize , i think we need to consider that young and old people have different perspective of life , due to different experience , which lead them to see life in a different manner . when people state that youger people enjoy life more , it is based on the feeling that their attituded towards life is more calm and not a passionate a when they were younger .
