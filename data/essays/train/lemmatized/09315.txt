there are some fluctuation in usage of some item while the time pas and the technolgy improves . some people think in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , but i do not think so . there are some item which their usage is decrasing day by day because of the improving technology . they replaced by their improved one , like walkman . in the past , we listen music by walkman very often but nowadays we prefer mp3 player that are more easy to use and have high music storage capacity . like walkman , car are improving every day but they are not replaced by another trasport vechile . people still need car for trasportation , but ofcourse with newer modal are preferd . in turkey in 1970s , every family ha maximum only one car . because there are very small production of car in turkey and it is very expensive to buy a car . in general people ha not enough power to purchuase a car . moreover having a car is not very nesscesry for every one because city were not a big a today . throughout the passing year , our country becomes to have better financial power and production quantity of car increase while their price are decreasing . so now nearly all famillies ha a car and some of them ha more than one . the reason for having h'gher amount of car is not only the low prive , in today world every individual need to own a car for fast and easy trasportation . we are in the technology age in which time is money . in conclusion , ofcourse there are some item which loose their importance and thir usage decrease when the time pas . i think not only car will keep their importance , but also their uasge will increase in twenty year .
