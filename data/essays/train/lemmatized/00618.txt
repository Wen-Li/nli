a man go for an interview thinking he is right for the job . he doe not know that only bookish knowledge in his related subject will not help in getting that job . neways , he go to the interview and he is questioned about many other topic in addition to his related field and obviously due to his lack of knowlegde he is unable to give the satisfactory answer to the question . this situation would not have arised had he been an expert in other subject a well . hence i am for the topic that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than to specialize in one specific subject . nobody can be perfect . learning is a process we have to undergo throughout our life . nobody can succeed if he know only a restricted source of information . a person should hence plan what he is goin to learn during his core education year which begin for most people at highschool and continue throughout college . specialization is not a bad activity but it is not a smart decision to specialize in one subject at the cost of the others . when speaking in public or even when talkin amongst friend for that matter woud n't it be great if one wa filled with academic knowledge and intellectual odassity ? nowadays people are specializing in more than one subject . has anyone ever wondered why ? all this is being done due to a change in thinking and a new approach of wider horizon and not a mental block that one should be efficient only in his or her related field of work . a person can grow his worth by havin broader knowledge of various academic subject a he will be able to tackle practical problem faced in life better his vast source of information and the large bank of knowledge he accumulated in his learning year . the world is changing , the challenge are becoming greater , cut-throat competition is taking place nowadays and thus only the best of the best can survive in today world where people are continously striving to reach higher in life . all this can be made a lot easier if a person ha a varied source of knowledge to bank upon and thus people should have a broad knowledge ofn academic subject than to specialize in one specefic subject .
