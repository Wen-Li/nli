the two concept of success and risk are they related ? are we sure to achieve our goal when we 're willing to take some risk ? a statement say that ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' . we could reply to this statement by another saying ` the best is the ennemy of the good ' . it mean that success is always appealing , but it over all need to be sustainable . however , i think the fact that we take a risk to try to achieve our aim is exciting . on one hand if we managed , if we indeed suceed , the achievement feel even better . the dimension of risk make it more unique . you appreciate more something when you have struggled for it . it also make you move forward , push your limit backwards . on the other hand , if we fail to suceed because we have dared commit in the project a the risk were present , then it make you revise your vision of the risk . are the risk taken worth the final goal ? to my opinion , i 'm willing to take risk when i have a minimum of visibility . i mean , i do not take blind risk and i do not count only on my luck . risks must be assessed . and it is important enough to be underlined , when we are taking risk , we shall not commit anyone else 's responsability without he or she acknowledges and agrees with it . so , i do agree with the initial statement . indeed , i think successful people are people willing to move forward , who make prove of tenacity to succeed . if you never try anything new , you do n't broad your scope .
