it is more importan for student to learn fact because would be better for the student to understand and it also would be more easy to remenber , i not agree with this for meny reason . first of all , is more easy for the studens remaid the fact or the esperience that they have because they have being in . also they would never forgent that . for example , when i wa in scholl i remenbered tha t i laked to go to the la boratoty to do some experiment and i felt that i never would forget that because l lived le experince . second , is more important for the studets stay in the facs because they can also show some posibles solution about whatever problem that the would have and lear abaut this experience , third , when the studens are in fact of some event , it is more exacted for then because they are living the experience . moreover , the studets would be more interested in the subject that they are coursing . also they would be better and work successfully . in conclusion , for all these reason i agree whit is more important for the student lear fact than learn abao the idea and conceps .
