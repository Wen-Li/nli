in my opinion , the term ` enjoyement ' is very subjective . it is a state of mind which may be experienced both by the young and the aged . to the youth , ` enjoyment ' could refer to socialising with their friend , partying , watching movie , adventure sport such a scuba diving . whereas , to an old couple , enjoyment couls imply relaxing at home , spending time with family , taking vacation or simply spending time at an aromatherapy spa . so to take a stand on which age group ` enjoys ' life more is rather difficult . however , if we define ` enjoyment ' a the feeling of experiencing the ` high ' of life , of taking full advantage of all the opportunity available to u today , then i believe , it is the youth which ha more of an advantage . the most important advantage that the younger people have is their health . not to say that older people are always sick , younger people tend to be fitter , healthier and more energetic so a to be able to avail of more pleasure of life . lets take for instance the example of scuba diving or trecking . it is most likely that a yound person would be much fitter to enjoy such activity . there are many case where older people are not even allowed to participate in activites on account of risk of heart failure , unfavorable atmospheric condition ( para gliding ) etc . however , many old people are fit to underatke these risk , they are generally advised not to . moreover , the youth ha a zest for life which is not very often seen in the older generation . this is not to say that the aged dont appreciate life , it is just that the youth ha more to look forward to than the elderly . what is unknown , always entices . to elaborate , the young look forward to all the thing that are in store for them for e.g graduating , going to college , taking vacation with their friend , travelling the world . while on the other hand , the aged have alreday been through the various stage of life and are not particularly excited about the future . infact most of them are more involved in the life and problem of their child who are busy ` enjoying ' life . as one grows older , the weight on responsibility on one shoulder increase . it is not possible for older people to take the same kind of risk the youth can take , may it be health-related , family related of even financial . let u consider the case of a graduate student and an old man who ha a family of five . the student is more likely to splurge his money on enjomnet activity such a partying , membership o sport club , travelling than a man who need to save his money in order to support his family . thus it lead u to the conclusion that , younger people have fewer financial restraint than older who need to support their family to conclude , it can be reiterated that ` enjoyment ' is an highly subjective term and may mean different thing to different age group . though our strict definition of ` enjoyment ' doe bring to light the fact that younger people ahve more time , money and energy to spend on enjoyment activity , the argument is in now way insulated from exception . exceptions are always there is every walk of life and so there might always older people who ` enjoy ' life more than the youth .
