i disagree the opinion that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today for the following reason . first , car make people more enjoyable . for example , people can travel to many place by using car . last year , i travel to hokkaido , a north island of japan . hokkaido is so vast that i decided to go around by rent a car . i went a eastan part of the island and see a part of russian island and went up to mountain to see some beautiful landscape . i had a very good time . i noticed that a car trip ha some good point . one is i can go anywhere i want . and second is i can go anytime during mu trip . if i had not use a rent a car , i would not have satisfied like this . as the example show , ca is necessary for people and there will more car in the future . second , car become le harmful to environment because of improving technology . today , there are some kind of car which is heartful to environment . for instance , i knew the news that a hybridcar , which is le harmful to the erath , is increasing . i also bought this kind of car because it is good for the earth . thanks to that technology , people can ride car le harmful to environment . it is the evidence that car will increase in twenty year . as the example demonstrares , car will be incrased in the future . in conclusion , i strongly believe that there will be more car in twenty year than now .
