today there is nearly no product which can be sold without any advertisement . and the past ha shown that those product who tried failed more often than were succesfull buyed by their customer . so this indicates for me that advertisement make prouducts more that they are because if it would not be like this a product could exist without it advertisement . so i agree with that statement ! it is clear that advertisement give the image of a product and also help to reach the buyer . and most of the company know how they can use this . they try to give their product the best image they could because than the customer will recognize it and buy it maybe next time in supermarket or somewhere else . to give an example i want to explain how it happend to me when an advertisement make me buy a product . a few week ago i mentioned an advertisement shown on television . it wa a new hair-shampoo which promise nice hair and a great experience by washing your hair . than the next day i went to the supermarket to buy such an shampoo . but when i washed my hair i could not feel the great experience of washing hair . plus , and this wa more important , my skin on my head wa red because of the shampoo . this make it obvious to me that this product wa not a good a it wa on it advertisement . so my own experience showed me that advertisement make product seem much better just to sell more of them . but i think it is normal that advertisments make product seem better than they really are because it function is to atract people ! today you seem silly if you believe in what an advertisement promise to you . so , it just thay go today when you want to sell thing !
