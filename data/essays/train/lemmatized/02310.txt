nowadays , it is often pointed out that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . personally , i agree with this idea . i 'd like to look at some of the reason . first , in current fast-speed society , young people are very busy in their own activity , such a study and sport . for example , some student have goal to become politician in the future . some student may want to become professiona football player . to realise their dream , they need to dedicate in their own activity . second , there are a lot of kind of distraction , for example , tv , music , movie , the internet , and so on . it is difficult for youth to look at helping their community , which doe not look like more attractive for them . third , it is not well known for youth how to participate in the activity of helping their community . i expect that there are some young people who are interested in helping their cummunities and want to participate in such kind of activity . however , from my experience , it is difficult to know how to join theire community , even though they have a littele interest and awareness of helping and contributing their community . these are the main reason why i think young people do not give enough time to helping their community . the cause are in both young people themselves and the structure of the society . therefore , i 'd like to propose to improve the system of the society . for example , i want the local government to establish and open the homepage where young people can obtain the infomation regarding helping their community . by introducing such kind of homepage , the door to joinning the community will open for young people who have a liitle interest in helping the community . and then i expect the society will become better .
