i agree with statement that nowadays young people do not give enough time to help in their community . today the people are busy with their own work and job that they have . they are not showing any interest about their community . mainly young people are not spending time to help their community , they are just seeking their own task and busy with thier necessary and unnecessary work . mainly people are not showing much interest in their own community itself , they are just hiding everything and they are not showing any care of their own community , i had faced many event , they are just going on their own way and they never think about the community they live but they are just enjoying what the community provide for them . mostly young people have no enough time to help thier community , they just not showing any interest of community . young people are the essential people to spend thier own time to help community , if they spend time on helping community the natoin and poeple automatically improves . young one have to play major role in helping community but these day it is quite not going , the younger one ar spending their much time in enjoying and some other unnecessary thing and they are not have enough time to even spend time with their parent . nowadays the culture and community are very much changed , youngers are showing much of thier skill in wrong manner and some of them even they dont know what they are doing , they are wasting much of thier time time by chating with thier friend and participating in unnecessary event and showing thier interest in their own like and dilikes and no one is thinking and caring about the society and the community .
