people nowadays have a variety of choice to go out . they can go by plane , car , bike or even by spaceship . since there are a lot of inventor still trying hard to bring out something new , i do believe that 20 year later , there will be considerably fewer car . i remembered reading a piece of news which said that a corporation in germany ha already succeeded in producing a kind of car that can both run on a road and fly in the sky . doors of the car can be used a `` wing '' when the driver press a special button in the car which instructs it to go up into the sky . though it wo n't be produced in huge amount very soon , there are chance that it 'll become popular one day . and they have possibility to take the place of car . there 's another reason that i believe the number of car is going to decline , which is because technology is getting more and more advanced , we will never know what will be invented in the future . maybe a car with much more seat than we have today , or a kind of bicycle allowing 20 person to ride at the same time . future is mysterious , and you never know what is going to happen . besides large car , innovative transportation and super size bicycle , a decent in population is sure to contribute to a drop in the number of car . many developed country , such a the swiss , germany , the united states and great britain etc. are all facing the problem of lack of youth . not many newly-married couple choose to have kid , so this directly lead to the situation . since there will be fewer people in the world , how can there be more car on the road ? well , these are the explanation for my choice , and i really hope a decent in car will occur because there are so many accident which have killed lot of people , and the bad effect they have brought to our unique atmosphere around the earth .
