there are several view which is related to this topic . some may think that there is no helping from young people for their community . however , i disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . nowadays , there are a lot of social problem in the world . these problem have to solve by citizen . however , if it ca n't solve at the first generation , the new generation , young people is needed . therefore , we can easily observed from the case that most of university student is participating for their society . they sometimes resist about unfair politics or not good enough international plan . for these case , we can realize that how they are really interested in thier society and try to help thier community . furthermore , all society are educating young people . this education make student to think and adjust for their new life when they grow up . so we can not determine that they are not helping their community . because studying is the basic resource which make educated people to think about social problem and to find the way to solve some problem . for a real , educated people usually participate their sociey . finally , the school ha a resposible for educating people without any limitation except age . they educate not only academic resource but also the importance about helpful behaves to poor people . we can easily notice from activity in school like go to orphanage and help orphan . of course , it is involved in the score and most school requires the record of working for poor people . young people are educated efficiently for help their community . when they educated , they naturally have an attitude to think about social problem a well a the student who did not study hard . also young people is the main resource which will manage and control the world . thus , it is not appropriate argument that young people is not helping thier community .
