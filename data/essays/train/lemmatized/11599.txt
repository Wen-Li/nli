in my view , this statement is half-true . success doe n't releave from only one factor . it often depends on external condition which one ca n't control . anyway , innovation is a good way to approach it , but it regularly must be based on thing we know to do well . being enterprising and trying new thing can be a real advantage for developing a project . in the economic field , the most successful people are the one who took risk presenting new idea . for example , the big bos of apple became a millionnaire developing a small new computer . moreover , trying new thing make the technology progress . the problem is that not anyone is capable of brilliants idea . we always think of successful entreprising people , but we should ask ourselves how many people who took risk really got glory . what about the person who invest thousand of dollar in project who turned to be desasters ? the idea that collapsed were n't all bad or stupid . sometimes a great innovation just do n't come at the good time . bright idea in 1928 were made to failled because of the crisis coming the year after . i would like to stress another point . it is not enough to try new thing and take risk to find success . the best way of being able to build a new thing is to be an expert in his discipline . continuing doing what we know to do well can lead u to imagine what could be done better , what is missing . to conclude , success happens when one act whitjkl
