the humankind always need success to reach good life standarts therefore success is very important aspect of humanlife . everybody ha different point of view about the idea of success . some assume that , successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well in contrary to some think that successful people should only do what they already know how to do well rather than try new thing and take risk . i personally agree with the first idea . these are my following reason . firstly , people sould find their best way . everybody who contains also successful people always try new thing . their solution are good or bad . therefore , people find out a solution which is the best way our life . for example , my father is business man and he is very succesfull . furthermore , he is always always interested in sport and he decided buy a company about sport so he took a risk . however , now he is more successfull than last . in addition to this , taking risk are amazing . i like taking risk so much because i belive that surprising solution make life mor joyfull and enjoyable . on the other hand , if we always do what we already know how to do well , our life will be so monoton and few year later we could n't love our life because we will know everythings solution . the last but not least , we learn more information about the earth , life , people due to trying new thing . if we try how many new thing , we could learn something much more last . all in all , a i said before successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . triying new experience provide u both successful and enjoyable life a well a learning more information .
