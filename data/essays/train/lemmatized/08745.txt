in my opinion , understanding is the key to the educational process . while teaching , a professor not only transmits his knowledge to student , but he also give them the key to comprehension . the most important point is not what we learn , but how we learn . for example , education system deeply changed during past year . if we take the time to ask our parent how wa school when they were kid , we would probably be astonished by their answer . indeed , they were used to learn their lesson by heart , and this wa a very mechanical exercise . sometimes they did not even know what they were talking about ! education system realized it mistake , and changed it technique . nowadays , an important role is given to interaction . indeed , student have now the possibility to ask question . the answer they would get would help them in easily understanding the topic they are discussing . as they get the meaning of an idea , a concept , they remember it in a better way . moreover , this interaction between student and professor allow them to show their interest in some topic . they are not passively listening , they can bring their opinion , their idea . this can lead to new issue , and open their mind . a concept can be spread from one to another , illustrating the very basis of development . the thing not only about knowledge , moreover about reflexion . school teach the power of thinking by ourselves . as the student understand idea , they learn fact , whereas the opposite doe not work .
