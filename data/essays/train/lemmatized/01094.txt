one statement i will support for sure is the following `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' . in this essay i will try to demontrate my opinion using specific reason and differents example . the mean objective of adverstisement is the purchase of the product by the consumer . almost everything is allowed to make the product appears better than it really is . this is one objective of advertising . so obviously when you discover the product you might be a little bit desappointed . for example , almost everyone ha been desappointed by one product that appears to have incredible property on tv . i remember having been desappointed with a christmas gist because the toy i saw on the tv wa not the same a the one i received but actually but it wa the same but wa not that fantastic a the tv said . another striking example is advertisement for candy and chocolate bar , in the advertisement they say that it is good product made with natural ingredient , but what they do not say is that it is bad for health to eat such junk food . almost all advertisement do not state the bad side resulting in the consumtion of the product , or try to exagerrate the good property of a product for instance a product might appears bigger in the advertisement or more shiny . as a result with the help of all these example i support the opinion that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
