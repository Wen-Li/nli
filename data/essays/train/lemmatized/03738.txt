i agree to the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . the modern world ha many commodity that keep youngster away from doing something charitable , or even doing something for themselves or their family . the tv , internet , video game , and extended mean of entertainment blur the eye of the young population , making them blind and deaf toward their environment . the concept of free time nowadays have reduced to home and outdoor environment . the young people are not motivated to do something useful during their free time . by medium , commercialization and more attractive mean of entertainment they are kept unaware of thing that go on with the community . for instance , you can not see a single young person in a retirement home today , unless they are forced to go by law or family . this is because they are both unaware and unwilling to perform community work . another reason is that they do not give enough time to community is that no mean of authority advises , encourages or requires them to do community work . they are merely ignorant individual who are unaware of what is going on in the community they live in . charity work is shown a something irrational , giving no individual benefit and taking up a lot of useful time that can be spent on other thing . as far a the competitive educational system and technological improvement in entertainment industry go , these young people will be le and le involved with their community . if the parent keep on reminding their child that academic success is their sole responsibility , - which is not - they will be le involved . unless something is done by parent or the government , the next generation will be le sensitive , more selfish and an asocial which are trait no human being should adopt .
