i totally agree that all advertisement show there product much more better than they really are . ofcourse that is what the advertisments are made for . the advertisments are done so they well attract the audiance 's eye . and that is done by makeing an exaduration of the subject , becouse if that did not happen the audiance will forget what they have seen eventualy after they see something ealse . for example the car advertisement , they well show that the car 's desine is really fine and smoth by certine light reflictions that will trick the audiance eye . also they will say that the car 's engine is really powerfull that they will show some loud soundeffects of the engine like a formula one car , and also the speed of the car can be easly tricking the audiance by any special 3d effect . here the advertisments can engaudge either or all of the human sences sight , hearing and so on . imagine if the advertisement are done by showing the product how they really are like , then every product that are at the same calss will be sold or known by the same number of people . then there would be no real competision between the advertisement company . my openion is that the advertisments company should have a certine kind of inspection . that would make sure that the product are matching there advertisments , so in that way they well beld a trust between the audiance and the product that are been advertised in the future .
