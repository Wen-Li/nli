i agree and also disagree with the statement , i think that 's up to the person if he or she prefer to have knowledge on many subject or on just one . like the person who created this statement , some people prefer to have a lot of knowledge on many subject because it might help them to have many work opportunity . however , to have broad knowledge on many subject is a very hard task . i know many people that have knowledge on many subject , but not a broad knowledge . those people i know have very little knowledge on many subject . if one decides to study a lot of thing , it would be ideal to study very hard . i agree on this part of the statement , that is great to know many thing , but i do not agree that is better than to dedicate to an specific subject . i think that people who specify on one subject could also achieve many work opportunity , but must work harder than those who prefer to study many subject , because for example , they have to focus on try to become the better candidate for a job . on my experience , i am a musician , and have decided to dedicate my life to music . i have to try and become one of the best musician to gain a good job . i have to compete with many other musician , great musician , and must focus on being a better choice than others . so , like i said on the beginning of this essay , it 's up to the person , to what the person like , if he or she want to have knowledge on one thing ; that 's good , and if he or she want to have nowledge on many thing ; tha
