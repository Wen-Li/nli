with the recent rapid economic development , the pace of life becoming faster and faster . consequently , few people nowadays think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . on the other hand , there are still people think that the fact is more important for student to learn . in my point of view , i think to learn fact is more important than the others , which mean i disagree with the topices and i will list my reason a follows . first , the most benefit of learn fact . is that people are living in the world all fill with fact . both commonsens and our experience have informed u that the more fact we have learned , the stranger we are . for instance . a student who work in a compeny for a summer job . he usually get lost of solution of many different problem from his work . nevertheless , under some circumstance , if the student just study a lot in college and learns how to understand the idea and the consepts he will just solve problem a what he learn from the idea and consept he got in college and some people may feel they are week . it should be potantially harfuml or at least unprodictable , in his carrea . sencondly , an arguement can be present my idea is that every people have to learn fact in theri life . it is obvious that people even can live without learn some idea and consepts . a good example can give some light to this point . the old man always tell his young the fact that he ha learn , which mean that the fact is more important for the young and for the student . however , to the contrary , nowadays we can see that lot of university student more difficult to get the jod than the college student just because college consider fact are importantfor student to learned . in conclusion , after the advantage and disadvantage weighed , and the biase opinion cast away , it is not difficult to say that it is more important for student to learn fact than understand idea and consepts .
