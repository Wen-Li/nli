i disagree the statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . i would like to present few reason and example to justify my opinion . in present scenario the use of car ha been increasing day by day . the first and one of the important reason for the increased use of car is urbanization . with the increase of the urbanization the use of car ha been increasing proportionally . i guess the scope for urbanization increase by a good extent within the next twenty year which further increase the use of car . secondly , people got used to the luxury of travelling in a car and also the advantage of it . cars with more feature and utility are being introduced competitively . these car increase the comfort level and also save their time . there are a few car which can even prevent accident by their sensor , which can also give the detail of the location that you are in . so people get attracted by these additional feature of the car and thus lead to the increased use of the car , there may be an argument that twenty year later most of the activity of the people may be completed through the use of internet . but people never stop themselves from going out and having faun travelling distance , meeting their friend personally etc . one more fact is that there are very few reason for the decrease in the use car like to control air pollution , to diminish the traffic on the road etc. , which would be of le importance to people when compared to the need of the car by them for their personal activity . if we consider a decrease in the use of car then what are the mean of transport ? the use of motorbike , bus , railway , airway must be the alternative which my not be a comfortable a using car . so i conclude that there is a very le scope for the decrease in the number of car in twenty year from today .
