if you had opportunity to travel favorite country or place , i predict you would be happy and excited before you take a trip . however , what would happen if the cost of trip is expensive , or if you do not have enough time to see place where you want to see ? it would possibly happen if you choose to travel with a tour guide . to avoid this fact , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide , to travel individually . taking trip with a tour guide is usually more expensive than individual trip . for example , the tour guide company prepares everything for customer such a booking plane , hotel , restrant , bus or car , anything neccesary for trip . on the other hand , if you prepare the trip by yourself , it could be cheaper . it is beacuse you might able to find cheaper plane ticket , cheaper hotel , etc . if we count on the tour guide company , we might have to pay more because earning money from customer is for thier business . if you travel with a tour guide , you might not able to visit place where you are interested in . it is because traveling a ` tour ' mean already ha route to see place . when i wa 12-year-old , my family and i went to france with a tour guide which wa not good choice for me . we went to a art museum which wa very boring place although i wa hoping i would be able to get france soccer team uniform and visit any soccer store . finally , i could not buy or visit any because of ` tour ' . from my thought and experience , i believe the best way to travel is individual trip . it is because it would be cheaper , and you might not satifsy the plan of tour .
