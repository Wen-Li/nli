the saying is true that most advestisments make product seem more efficient or much better than they really are . i have reached my conclusion due to the following reason . firstly , like the product yoko height increaser . secondly , the advertisement of different chip firm . most importantly , the product about which their is alot of comotion in cannada . recently , when i wa in calgerry in cannada their wa and adverting that said the only thing that will increase one 's height wa this product . that wa all false a when my friend told me about the the same product he used , he told me that the made false claim . he had being using that very product for an year and still their were no increase in his height . this show how different firm in the world make false claim about their product . also , at the back of every chip packet their are the name of the ingerdients used of which some are harmful . but in a promotion , the promoter when asked about the quality of the chip being sold claim that the he/she is selling is the best in term of health . whereas when one consumes the chip find out that the chip actulaay have some harmul chemical , which would harm the health of the individual . from a recent incidence in my life , that wa ssince i had consumed a certain kind of chip , which wa claimed to be advantage to health had actually caused me cancer . it didi so due to the pesence of an extremely hazardous chemical . the above example explained show how an advertisement display it 's product in abtter smatter and more reliable way than the product really is .
