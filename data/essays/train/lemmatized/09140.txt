helping people is one of the most important thing everyone should do during his/her life . we all know what happened in the past and what is happening now in war that only take death and disaster . it 's fundamental to try to think about it because we can understand what are the consequence of hate and interest in money . unfortunately they lead people not to consider the relationship with others even if it is one of the best thing you can experience . i will explain why young people do n't give time to helping other people and i will say my idea on it . first , we can ass how they spend their time . they are interested in playing with their friend , having an expensive car and going out in the evening abusing alchol and drug . this problem can be found in the society that send that kind of massage through internet and the television . second , it 's important to consider the family in which everyone grows . in my opinion , the role of the parent in helping their child in their decision and giving them suggestion about their problem is crucial . i am lucky because i always had a good relationship with my parent .
