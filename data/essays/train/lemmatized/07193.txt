i totally agree this satement because i have been taught in this style . teachers always say the most important thing for being a student is that you need to comprehend the main idea and concept , which may either appear on the exam or use frequently in your lifespan . i believe that the most of concept and main idea which had been examinated before published , so the concept and idea i have been studied are all based on fact , meaning they are all connected with each other . if the new fact appears , it also will be modified or adapted into the concept or idea i 've been studing . therefore , i agree that learning idea and concept mean learning that fact . if the newly discovered fact conflict with the established coincepts or idea , how should those publisher do ? well , i asked this question to my professor before , and he told me that if the new fact conflict the established concept . the specific evaluator will figure out the menthods to fix the original concept . for example , if the gravity were not 9.8 , the scientist will demostrate the experiment for both old result and the new fact . moreover , once they discover that the fact is valid , they will replace concept with the new concept based on the result from experiment , meaning the ideal concept and the optimal idea will modified according to the new concept . therefore , the concept and idea i have been studying will be made sure whether or not it 's correct . in contrast , apparently , the discovered fact are not always valid . for example , there is one kind of fly whose eye are red , which is the fact , but that kind of fly is a unique sample among differents kind of fly . of course , scientist will add the new concept to adjust the old concept , but can we conclude that the eye color of fly should be red ? that it , sometimes we need to use idea or concept to clarify whether this fact is valid or not . therefore , we will have thecorr
