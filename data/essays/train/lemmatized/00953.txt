i disagree with this statement because even if old people are n't healthy anymore they can do a lot of thing and have a much fun a younger people have in their life . the first reason for my opinion is that not all old people are so weak and ill that they only can lie in bed . and even if they ca n't to sport anymore or maybe ca n't walk at all they can do other thing that bring a lot of fun to them . for example they can learn something in course especially offered for older one or they can read amazing book or looking good film . another reason why i think that old people can have a lot of fun is that they have much more time than young people have , because of not beeing forced to go to work eight or ten hour every day . because of that they only have freetime , and can spend it with their family , or travel in foreign country for example . finally old people can have maybe even more fun than younger one because of their increased level of experience . the long time old people have already been on earth cause they have a lot more knowlegde about how thing work in life . they connected a wide range of different charakters , solved a lot of problem and so learned much about themselves . so old people know enough what kind of activity they enjoy and what kind of people they like . with that knowledge most thing are easier and cause le trouble . for example a weekend trip make more fun if you 're in a group you fit in . in conclusion experience and a lot of free time let have old people have a lot of fun , even if their ill . they just have to visit group or course for old people or spending their time together with friend or their family by doing thing they enjoy .
