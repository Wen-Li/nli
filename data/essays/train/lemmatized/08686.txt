in our world , everything can be sell , from a coke , a chair and alcoholic drink , to security service , hair brushers and even medicine . television , radio and internet are way of advertising a product . i agree with the fact that the majority of these advertisement make thing seem so much better than they truly are and there are many reason to think that . first , in an advertisement that is presented on television , the product that is being promoted appears like if it is the best thing in the world , and most of the time , it is not . for example , when a company is trying to sell a soda , a coke , it present a cold coke with some ice on it and a woman , because a woman sell better than a man , drinking it with passion , and at the moment that she feel the flavor , there is an explotion of excitement and refreshment , making you think that you need to buy one of those because it seems amazing . after you bought one , you get frustrated because it wa not what they told you it will be . second , if something that is for sale is really the best thing in the world , the people that sell it would not have to promote it very much , the people will buy it without anything that make them do it . for example , you never see a computer or an effective medicine that are being promoted by showing a half-naked girl . on the contrary , they just tell you it characteristic , and sometimes they do not even show the computer to you . finally , it is good to conclude by saying that we all have to pay a lot of attention to thing that are advertised on the mean of communication , we have to do this because we might buy something that , at the beginnig , we did not even want it . in addition , we have to be very careful and not let this people to wash our brain , instead , we should know what we really want and buy what we truly need .
