some people say that young people have more fun in life than the elderly . in my opinion these people are absolutely right in saying that . besides of body weakness and deseases their are a number of reason why young people have more possibility to really enjoy life . although already mentioned in the introduction , i want to underline the importance of physical fitness once again . not only that older peole are far more often sick , their body are just not functionning the way young body do . this is examplified in sport . in my opinion sport are very important for the quality of one 's life . there is no denying the fact , that the elderly do not perform a well in sport a younger people . one can see this in professional sport . it happens rarely that a person older than 35 is playing soccer in german bundesliga . moreover old people often have to quit doing sport because of physical problem . another aspect regarding physical fitness is the time of recovering after a desease or an injury . it just take far more time for older people to recover completely . an addional important advantage of young people is that they still have so many thing to experience . young people can learn every day new thing . not only in an educational way . the youngers have a lot more opportunity to get to know new friend . people in that age connect much easier . furthermore a a young person one doe not have a many commitment . old people are often settled and living a very organized life . in contrast , young people can decide to study and live abroad for a certain time - or forever - without having to discus this with a wife and child . you are just more independant . to come to a conclusion , i am very happy being young . i still have the opportunity to enjoy my life a much a possible . this doe not mean that i am affraid of getting older . i just think that i have to do certain thing now a i will not be able to do them later - when i am one of the elderly .
