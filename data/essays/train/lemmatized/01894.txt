knowing about many academic subject may sound good at the first sight . it may sound like , a person ha educated him/herself quite well so that he/she know many thing . but i think it doe n't work that way , specializing in one spesific subject is much more important than broad knowledgedge of many academic topic . first ; how far can a person may go in many academic subject all together ? in other word it is impossible for a person discover fundemental aspect of many academic subject at the same time . at this point , actually it can not be inferred that the subject are known by the person . knowing is far beyond having only an idea about something . in contrary , focusing on one unique subject will make it possible to learn deep detail of it . by this way , one can claim that he/she know the subject . related to the point mentioned so far , the industry nowadays is quite aware that expert on a subject are quite valuable . since technology and industry developes quite fast , improving a new thing bacema quite hard and it need indepth knowledge of the subject . therefore focusing on a spesific academic subject will definetely rise a person 's chance in his/her career . another point is that , if a person can manage to specialize on an academic or another subject , this give great satisfaction . namely , the person will be in demand and maybe will be the first name that the people around remembers about the subject . in contrary ' it is very hard to get this domination satisfaction by knowing little about many topic . to conclude , it would be much better to specialize in one spesific acadamic subject rather than having knowledge of many of them . this will help a person in career and in practical life . knowing something need really good spesific focusing .
