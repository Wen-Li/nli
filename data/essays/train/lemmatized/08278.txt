i think it is very relative the answer to this question . relative because of the kind of people who are traveling . in my opinion , i would prefer to travel with a tour guide , who can help me with any doubt that i would have , and that would be with me always explaing to me the history of the place i am visiting ( thing which i consider very important ) . but there exists person who prefer to make their trip alone , without any tour guide to be there to help them in any problem they could have during their travel . i have an idea of that people a very independant people , who like to take the risk of being almost lost , or maybe they just feel more adventure when during their time in the trip , they doesnt depend on anyone to make the thing done . personally i do not prefer this way of traveling , a i already said , but i would make an exception just if the place where i am visiting , i already know . i consider that it would be surely complete the tour to the place , if you go in company of some one whose work is to show the history to people , and to explain how doe thing work in the place . because not evry single detail is on a tourist map , is it ? there are not better instruction for the people who are tourist , a the one of the `` native '' . there is just one thing in which i agree with the people who doe n't take a tourist guide to lead their trip , is that some time it is a lot much better to be alone , and to discover the place mystery be one 's self . i think that is the only point with wich i would agree with the traveler who doe not take a tour guide . so it is very relative what would be best for people , because there are a lot of different point of view .
