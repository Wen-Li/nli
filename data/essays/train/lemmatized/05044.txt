normally , i prefer a broad knowledge of many academic subject . as the point of view in my future career , however , i diagree with having broad knowlege from several field of academic . first , i would like to pay attention the quality , not the quantity . although it is better to know much more knowledge , i believe that infromation like that is not usefull in my future practical career . also , i can get in touch the knowledge when i ac the internet . there are so many web page on the net . whenever i can learn what i want . i do not worry about the time and cost . almost information on the net is free . second , a specialized knowledge is a priceless for me . for instance , to be a specialist need to not only knowledge but skill in business world . i think that a specialist can only proceed a confused situation in near future . special knowledge and skill can promote me to be success in my future career . moreover , income will be better than average worker . a lawer or a doctor can get high salary during his job because they certainly have a special knowledge and a skill . their mature experience can solve many form of problem when the crisis situation happen . also , i can have a confidentional to own job . finally . i dont not totally diagree with a broad knowledge , but these information only take advantage of some trivia or a bit quiz . as i see it , i strongly believe that it is better to acquire a special knowledge in my life .
