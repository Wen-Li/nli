we all know that technology is the most rapidly developing thing in the world and who can predict how we will live after twenty year from now ! it is really hard to tell what will future bring u . twenty year from now , is a very long time and i think everything that seems imposibble today might be normal in daily life in future . this includes the use of car , of course . i think i am not agree with the idea that fewer car wil be in use in a twenty year time period . because the 21 th century is the century of the speed . people even today are always worried for not to be late to go from some place to another . this is usually cause a big stress to people . i close my eye and can imagine the time 20 year from now . what i see are people that are more faster and hurrying around than today 's people . in my opinion people of future will need much faster car than today 's car . furtermore they will need much more car than they need today . because the number of the people is increasing day by day , rapidly . in order to support the increasing people 's need the number of the car will increase , either . another thing that support my idea above is the globallism . the trade and the communication between county are speading every day . this globallism will cause an increase in transportation between country around the world . in order to transport easily and quickly from one place to another there will be more heavy transportation car such a track exc . i think these are all to say in order to support my idea that 20 year from now there will be more car than today . may be car will change and may be they look diffrent but this wiil not change the fact that their number will increase .
