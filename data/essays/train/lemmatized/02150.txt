it is arguable that which is better to have broad knowledge of many academic field or to have specific knowledge of one subject deeply . i agree that it is better to have broad area of many academic subject . in my case , i am studying international study . international study contains many area such a international politics , international law , diplomacy , international political economy , peacekeeping , security , international organization like the united nations and foreign policy of many country . i should know these all of area , even i can not know deeply . meanwhile some people believe that it is better to have specific knowledge in one subject insist knowing deeply in one subject is more important than knowing broadly , because if someone need to master one area of study , he/she should have background and history of this subject first , then start to absorb all chapter of this specific subject . in that someone can be said he/she is master of this subject . however , even people who believe that it is better to specialize in one specific suject , they should study outside area of their subject to need to understand their own subject easily . moreover , the knowledge becomes clear after touching broad area . sometimes one or more theory can not be understood at once with these own theory . those must be dealt with other theory from different field . basically , the most of study are connected in similar area , so it can not be considered and understood seperately . for instance , interior design , it is connected with art and architecture . if interior designer doe not aware the base of them subject , he/she can do his/her work . it mean that designer should know about the color and structure of building to achieve his/her work . to sum up , it is better to have wide knowledge of many academic subject than specific knowledge , even it need more deepen understanding sometime .
