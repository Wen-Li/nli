does having knowledge in all type of academic subject is better than being an expert on only one single subject ? actually i both agree and disagree about it . because both of them ha advantage in some sort of area . a person must always try to learn more and more in my opinion . because it is a key to success . a person who is able to speak about every subject get respect from people . because by this he/she can prove himself to everyone in every field . for example in social life or in bussines . if a person ha an idea and thought about every argument or debate he is in , he will just keep getting respect from people . i am not saying that a person must be a genius in every field . he only ha to gain some information to prove that he ha thought to be considered by people . if you want to be taken serious by them you must gain respect and this is a way for it . but a person who is an expert on what he doe a a job , get respect in only his field . but this is not a disadvantage for the person because it is an aim which he should have . for example , a plactic surgeon who ha mastered in his field , get more patient . the patient who are satisfied by his work tell his name to their friend and this chain will go on and on . by this , the surgeon will have a good reputation . and this reputation he ha will return him by more patient . and the surgeon will be successful in his main aim by working a a surgeon : making money for a living . in my opinion a person must have knowledge in every area of work , art , academic subject etc. to gain respect in social life . but he/she must ha to be a master in his area which he doe a a job if he want to gain respect from community .
