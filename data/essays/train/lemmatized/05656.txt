all along the day , we are surrounded by car . they are integrated in our environment and they are part of our life . nowadays , car have become the main way to transport human . there are different way to use it for the daylife or occasionally . you can use it when you go to your workplace , at school , to do shopping , or to go to holiday . however , the abusive use of the car ha led to many problem such a cost , price of oil , the depedency of arabian country , pollution , the traffic . so , there is a dilema because we both need car and in the same time they are destroying our planet . in the first part , we will discus about the positive aspect of the car , in the second part we will discus about the drawback of using a car and finally we will discus about the alternative of the car . first of all , car have a social and economic impact . when you have a great car , it mean that you have a high salary and a high social position . cars ' constructor have understood this and they want to offer to their customer the most technollogical advanced car with a high power motor and they also add some gadget such a gps , television and other many option . the constructor made a lot of benefit on it and they have high return on investment . so , car have a positive impact on the economy and i do n't think that the government will try to put restriction on this . however , the government , try to limit pollution . in france , you have not the right to use you car when there is a high level of pollution in the air . he try to regulate the traffic and push people to use common transport such a the bus or the subway . in my opinion more and more people do n't use their car any more to avoid the traffic . there are some alternative such a hybrid car which don ' t use oil . i think this is the best solution because it is a compromise .
