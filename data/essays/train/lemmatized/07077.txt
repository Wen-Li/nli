along with the development of mass medium and mass culture came the development of advertisement , helping to create what is called `` the consumer society '' . advertisement is supposed to make you buy a product , it is a message that make the product appealling so that you buy it . in order to do so , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . it is a very common experience to be disapointed by what you just bought . i just bought an mp3 player because it looked great on the advertisement but i discovered that it doe not work with many computer . this is the time when one say `` it looked so much better in the commercial '' . advertisements are not to be blame for that because it is their very purpose : to make you buy . in order to do so , it ha to show what is best in the product . it is very rare to see a commercial that will ill-speak of a product . it doe exist and it is called `` negative publicity '' but even this is a form of advertisement . most of the time an advertisement will just focus on what is great about a product . if advertisement sometimes make product seem much better than they really are , advertisement are not allowed to lie about the product . if they do , the advertisement company can be sued for `` false advertisement '' . that mean that an advertisement never really lie but just show the product in a way that make you want to buy it . having realized that it is the very role of advertisement to show product under their most appealling appearance , perhaps one should consider the consumer 's responsibility . indeed one should not always take for granted what is said in a commercial . it is his responsability to use his critical sen and not be misguided by advertisement . this is a lesson i learned the rough way !
