yes i totally agreed with this that successfulpeople try new thing and take risk , a there are more confidentiall by themselves and they will get experience to hold with , the situation so they will easily jump in the new trial . as they got the success in new thing they are automatically pushed in the new trial , a they are well supperted by the public also because the are already won the public keep the same hope from those successor . i remembered well that of my friend he got sucess writing , who is very sucessful writer he do very good job in writing ariticle . his bos always appreciated by his article by his job even the journalist company also got a good fame the newspaper of his is become all over in india because of my friend ability he got the sucess very soon and quickly . by these sucess my friend got the confidence and experiment in writing and in himself , in a very little time my friend started writing a novel and story book also . as soon he got a sucess in the article he placed himself in the novel and story book in which he got a tremendous sucess in the sucess he wa not only supported by his friend , relative and by the public also right now he wa not only a famous article but also a famous novelist and a story writer . in my opinion the person who got the sucess in one thing he should jump in another thing , also . he should take the advantage of the every movement which he will get by his hard work and by stress . he should take the advantage of his sucess , his hard work and gift given to him by god , he should not shy by taking a risk , and he should not thing that if he wa not thing he wa not win ? what happens he will going to get a marked with his prior sucess also but he should encourage him self and keep in mind that `` every adversity of the life teach a lot then getting a victory directly '' . so , i always encourage to myself and to my friend and my family that taking a risk is not a bad . taking a risk and playing with a life is only a life .
