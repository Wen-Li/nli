in my opinion there is a need for specialist and generalist . with generalist i refeere to people who have a broad knowledge . if everyone is specializing on his topic no one ha an overview of the total problem and on the other hand if all student focus on many academic subject there wo n't be any specialist to do specialized work . for student there sould be a choise wether to get a broad knowledge or specialiye on one subjet . it is important that one can figure out what suit him or her best . for me it is specializing on a specific subject , but i still want to have knowledge of the surrounding field of study . if there is quite a broad interest in subject and a specialisation in one topic at the same time , it is possible to link one thing from one field to the specialised field and eventually come up with something new and inovative . i think there are also some slight difference between the field of study . for business student it is neccesary to know a lot of a huge varyity of topic , but the need to go into detail is not that big . this is different for student from engineering . to bring the research or production forward it is vital to know all detail of existing solution . so an engineering student must focus on one topic if he like to contribute to that subject . but still with specializing on one specific topic he sould not forget about the view of the total . if the statement is taken a a general statement i have to say that i do not agree with it , but it is correct in specific field of academic . during my work expirience i saw that sometimes it ha to many specialist and ofthen they forget about what the whole picture is . in there case the statement could lead some people to be a generalist . these generalist then could help the specialist to work to gether and direct them to a good solution . the statement ha some truth withing but i ca n't agree with it totaly .
