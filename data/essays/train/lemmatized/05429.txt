successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . this statement is saying that successful people take risk and i am kind of agree with it by the fact that they are already successful meaning that they do n't have a lot to lose . i will , in a first part describe how successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , in a secon part , why not , staying in the same field without taking risk ? successful people try new thing and take risk . we can say that some of the successful people try new thing in the fact of get into something new , something that they are not in and they take risk . thoses risk they take is to try something new , to show to themselves that they can succeed in a new field . now , why taking risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do ? maybe to try some other thing , to be oppen-minded , to know differents thing , sensation and feeling . we can take the exemple of arnorld shwazeneger who is an actor but also the maire of california . he wa a successful person a an actor but who could ever imagine him a a politicy member ? thus , successful people like to take risk , to prove to themselves that they can succeed in diferent field . moreover , we can asks ourselves : why taking risk ? and why not staying in the same field where they are doing what they already know how to do well ? actually , it depens on the character of each person , some like new thing and risk to get into something new all the rise , some prefer to stay in the same speciality by doing what they already know how to do . although , to conclude , i will say that i am agree with the following statement : successful people try new thing an take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . once , by the fact that successful people have all the key to take risk even if it doe n't work . then , they are already successful in what they are doing so , they can take the risk to try something new . and , it really depens on the person , some like new sensation , to try new thing , even if they do not succeed , at least , they have tryed .
