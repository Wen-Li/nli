nowadays student do n't want to do too much effort learning topic . despite that thought , i think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than simply learn fact . one of the reason for student to clearly understad idea and concept is motivation . if sudents understand idea and concept they will get motivated . for example , in anatomy class student should understand how the digestion process is done . later on , they will be able to understand the importance to eat healthy . even more they will be encourage them to eat le bad foot and increase the healthy food . the student understand the concept of digestion and they can have the idea of eat healthy . another reason for student to understand idea and concept is easier to learn when people understand concept . i remember when my professor explained to me how the heart work . first he gave me the example how a water system work . also he gave me the concept of pressure and then how the water can run around the system . at that time i wa able to learn how is the heart 's work . finally undertanding concept and idea student can increase their creativity . most of the people who ha discoverd new invention have understood the concept and the idea how thing work . for example , people had to undesrtand the concept how the wheel worked in order to invent the car . after that their creativity increased and the final product wa the car . in conclusion , student who know in deep concept and idea are able to perform easier in any field because their motivation , learning and creativity will make them to apply his knowlege in any task in life .
