`` high risk promise sucess and high return '' i will always agree with the point of taking risk and venturing out in new area is always better than to remain stagnant in particluar position even if it involves risk . there are many example of people who were unsuccesful in their career , so they went out in open battle field of this world and took risk and now they are sucessful , for example dhirubhai ambani and ratan tata . their are many advantage of taking risk , first , it open up new area to be explored like a person can even devlop a new sector himself . second , high risk is always followed by high return and great empire which can help easily diffrentiate the person from non-risk taking coward . third , doing new always call for learning process and entertainment . a person can learn a lot more if he or she ha a risk taking attitude . also through this process a new cycle of step devlop like : first no competion in new area leading to more profit which inturn lead high sucess which in turn lead easy eastablishment . moreover , the risk attitude devlops a personal quality of sportsmanship and the ability to fight back . as their are always two side of coin , some people might think the risk taking attitude to careless attitude and unsophiticated thing but they have to agree that taking risk give more then what it take either in form of monetary benefit or learning process . `` higher the one succeds the higher risk he ha taken . '' in the future the buissness and people who have caliber and postive attitude will succed and the critic of risk will face an uncertain future , so to be succesfull one ha to take quality of succesful people and adopt them and the prominent one among them is risk .
