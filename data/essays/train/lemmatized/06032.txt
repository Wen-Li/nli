it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . my reason is memorazing a bunch of fact about a topic will not able to indentify and clearly understand the concept of the subject would be awful for the student . on the other hand only learning the fact about the subject the student only know about the coclusions . they always spend their time for memorazing the information because of this many important hour for human life spend for nothing . the most important thing is understand the idea and the concept . in my hometown , many of high school ' student have to pas an exam which is called oss which is for apply the university . the stundent responsibles of the four yerars high school education . the problem is you have to memorize lot of fact and detail about the question . the detail which she or he will forget after some decade day later . this situation show that fact of student take the exam and they spend a lot of money and hour for nothing it wa onlly about the pas the exam and a result of this preparation course do not give a chence improve the your knowledge . in my opinion the student must be aducated in a traning which enables them to use their potentioanl about the subject . this kid of work give a chance them to understand the idea and concept of work . in addition to this in an effective learning sytems for example learning with activity , diagram , and traning useful for the student . the student could choose their course to understand the idea of the subject and concets , because if the student want to study abour for his or her master learniong fact doesnt help him or her .
