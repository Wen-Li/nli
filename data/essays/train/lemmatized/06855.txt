young people feel life inside , while old people loose their energy . this is the main difference i think . an old man ha a lot of experience inside him ; he could feel tired sometimes : thing are n't even more new , they do n't communicate the same sensation they were used to do in the past . in fact a young person know that he ha a whole life to live . he enjoy living looking at the future , while an old man life looking at what he ha lived in the past . a young person ha the enjoy to create his future catching each single sensation coming from the outside ( the world ) . a baby is usued to enjoy everything because everything is new ; a very old person may feel like he ha no more reason to live , and so his life becomes something like `` waiting for godot '' , waiting for something trying to find some distraction to spend life . we have to underline that physical condiction is essential for enjoying life too : normally young people feel better so they can do a lot of thing that old people ca n't , like sport , that rappresents an important way to satisfy ourselves . the preoccupation of healty is another main attitude that contribuites to make old people to life in fear . but this is n't always correct : it depends even on the society . i explain : in this year i can see that many friend of mine ha lost their way of enjoying life ' like they are missing something . they are just living waiting for a better future condition . my grandfather instead wa used to have fun in each single moment of his life ' even when he wa said he would have died . it 's wired i think . in my personal opinion i think we have to enjoy life always bacause it ha given to u a great opportunity and we must not let it go away .
