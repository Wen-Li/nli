the topic given ha it own intricacy , and to justify and convinced with a thought , we have to comprehend the rudiment of learning process . i agree with the point presented that it is important for student to understand idea and concept than learning the fact . to understand a subject , one should have strong basic about the idea and concept behind it . for instace , if we take physic class , student should be well aware of principle of aerodynamics before they learn the fact about a rocket or an aeroplane mechanism . nevertheless , argument can be made that learning the idea and concept are the gradual step of learning process and coming to fact . learning is a process where an individual ha to go through certain step to master the subject . understanding concept and idea lead to actual fact . subject can be learn in numerous way , if we just know the fact without understanding the actual concept and idea behind it , it wouldnt master you in subject and knowledge would n't persist for a long . therefore , i personally advocate the process of understanding concept and fact throughly before you come to actual fact . this way of learning will be efficient for student to learn the subject with a perfection . approaching the process of learning is this manner will get depth knowledge which may endure .
