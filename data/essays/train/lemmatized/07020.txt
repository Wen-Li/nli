today , it is enough for a lot of student to learn fact about certain issue and topic only . in my opinion it is not enough to learn fact only . a student ha to focus on how to understand an idea and a concept . first of all , a student should understand an idea to build up his own opinion . he gather idea of several people and try to make up his own mind . understanding the idea give the student oppurtunities like duscussing about it and create other idea . another important point is the understanding of a concept . when a student understands a concept he can transfer this pattern to other issue and compare and contrast them or add information . also , he can modify different thing which he doe n't like about it . learning fact doe n't give student the possibility to consider whether a fact is good or not . he just learns it and doesnt even think about it . in contrast , understanding idea and concept allows a student to discus and talk about it because he ha enough information about a topic . beside this , a fact is not modifyable that mean that a student might talk about it but he ca n't add information . a fact represents statistic or particular issue which ca n't help student to transfer idea or concept on other thing . understanding idea and concept make it possible to spread out your knowledge on other field . for example , a student should be able to use the idea and concept , which he learned during the lesson , to create other sentecnes in a exam .
