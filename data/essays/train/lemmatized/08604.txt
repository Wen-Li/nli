i agree with this statement because at the begining of every inovation stay idea and concept . without them you can learn nothing about fact . this statement can be best described on the example of the begin of a carrear . if you are new in the company and you are chalenging with new task and maybe problem which you have to solve . what would help you ? you have to start with analysing the problem . this implies that you have understood the concept . after this you can try to develop idea which could lead you to solution . and only at the end you will use the fact to come up to the solution . another aspect wich confirms this statement is the fact that that the fact are always available . you can get the fact from book , from internet and from another different source but there are no source for idea . if it would be so than there would be a lot of reach people . so the main aim of every study should be the ability of developing idea . this is also the main feature which make difference between university and scool . the fact are the content and only helpfeaters which you use to realise your idea .
