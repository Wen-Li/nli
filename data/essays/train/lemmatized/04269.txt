in my opnion , there is no doubt that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . however , some people have opposite opinion , so i must explain carefully . we have those who believe that people had better to study about one specific subject . they think that the way is more effective to produce professional . in addition , they feel that the wide range of knowledge is not necessary for professional such a engineer and artist . forexample , some pianist who had educated only play the piano . however , he became a very famous pianist . even though he did not have general knowledge , he could live himself . over the recent year , the problem ha happened which the young people can not find their way . some person feel that the wide range of knwoledge affcted the problem . it is natural that people who ha a lot of way make him confused . in contrast , we have those who believe that the people , especially student must study many accademic subject . because , studying only one subject make narrow student life . to sum up . we must pay attention what student to need . after that , we must give them chance todecide .
