i do not completely agree with this statement , because young people usually do not realize what they have and how short and quickly the youth is . young people are continually expecting something of extarordinary happens to make them happier , but without knowing nor themselves what this extraordinary mean . have you ever red the colombre by dino buzzati ? it is a nice metaphor of young people searchign a chemere during his youth , which never is found , so that they can not taste the flavour of happyness during his flowerishing age . moreover , young people spend often their time doing nothing . i see these guy standing outiside bar , smoking , drinking , of course smiling , but without a serious purpose and so risking of getting bored . in other word , they waste their time . on the contrary older people , who have le life time ahead them , do not waste time , they appreciate all what they have . they do not wait for something special happens , they do not get angry for the boyfriend or girlfriend . older people appreciate the time passed and most of time are satisfied of what they have done during their life . they feel joy for the fact of having had child , who at their turn have had other child . older people , despite the young , have had in the most of case a brillant job , or just a job , which ha let them create a family , buy a house , go on holiday . they are fullfilled of their reached object . as far a young people concern , this is not always true . although young people have more life time ahead , it doe not mean fewer worry . let u think of young people now : the problem of job , the problem of durable job , the worry of buying a their own house without a job ! ... concludind , enjoying life doe not concern on what we are doing , but it relies on our expectation and what we managed to do before .
