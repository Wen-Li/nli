people started to learn in school but after sometime book are not enough . especially for historical place you need to go and see this place to understand and to feel the history better . the question is to go there and discover this place by yourself or go and join a tour and let the gude help you . i prefer going without a tour guide . i have some specific reason for this . first of all if you go to a place with a tour guide you must always follow him . you can never wait to take some more picture , look something from a different view . even you can not stop when you are hungry thirsty or tired . because you are not alone and the guide ha got a program for this day . it ha to be done . also if you go there alone you can discover some other place that are not famous but interesting . at the end of the day you feel very tired because you saw many place bu you never satisfied . also most of the guide ha got a style depends on wrong but interesting story and stupid joke about everything you saw . espesially when you get on the bus to go some place they take the microphone and they never stop talking . they want to entertain you but these kind of stuff become annoying afterten minute . you can never look from a window and enjoy the view because you always hear laugh and song . and at the end when you want to go somewhere with a tour guide it is always two or three time expensive than you go alone or with your friend . and after all when you return from vacation you relaize that you do n't remember anything you do n't have enough souveniours and picture and you have to go there again . because of all these reason if you want to see a place think more about this vacation make a good plan with your friend and never add a stranger especially a guide to your plan .
