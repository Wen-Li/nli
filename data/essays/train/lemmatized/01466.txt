that is actually a topic which is dicussed by a lot of student i know year after year . a lot of them argue that lerning fact have nothing to do with the intelligence of a person and are rarley needed in one 's future job . to a certain degree i agree with their opinion because an engineer should understand that he is not allowed to use a weak material for the fondation of a house but that he rather ha to choose a strong material one can build on . that is nothing one have to learn but what is rather logical . others , on the conrary argue that some fact are necessarly to understand a certain idea . my favourite example is that an engineer who finished his study will not be able to build a house or even a machine if he doe not know which component exist to build or to construct them . that is why engineer have a special subject in which they learn which range of component can be used to construct a machine or to build a house . to be honnnest , i believe that there ha to be something in between . i know a lot of student who learn a lot and thus know many specific fact in their field but they do not have a structure for their knowledge . one could say : `` they can not see the forest because of the tree . '' they have problem to analyse a new situation because they are not openminded but caught by their thought . on the other hand i know quite a few student who actually do not learn at all but they still can analyse a situation properly and give a good answer . nevertheless , they lose ground a soon a a dicussion becomes more detailed . finally , i have to say that i do not agree with that answer because i believe that understanding idea is a important a lerning fact are . to be more precisely , i believe that one have to learn fact in the beginning to understand a concept or an idea properly . that is the way i used to learn during my study and that is what i would recommend to everyone .
