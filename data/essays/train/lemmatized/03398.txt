the question depends on how people keep in their mind which one is better for their life . to get a confortable life after young people become older people , they work very hard to get a lot of money . on the other hand , after some people enjoy their life when they are young , they work very hard to handle their family or theirself . in my case , i totally disagree that young people spend a time to enjoy their life more than elder people do through my experiance . i am taking a toefl test to get into a graduate school from massachusatts institute technology in boston . over the past 7 year , i graduate college with my greate reputation . i got a shcolarship for 4years , and then i got a job in the military a a first lietaneunt for 3 year . moreover , i did not satisfy my life at that time . so i am challenging for my life to get better than before . this period time is very significant to drive my life . `` do i enjoy my life righ now ? '' it is really hurt to keep doing my situation . to support my future life and my family , i am definitely supposed to work very hard and to get a job for my life . usually , in korea , almost all young college student would like to hang around and to enjoy with their freinds when they are college student . however , they never spend their time inefficient in campus because all of people want to get a job more than they expected their job due to prepare their future . at the end , when young people study very hard to get a their job and work their company their future , older people enjoy their life with their erned money when they were young such a to play golf , tennis , skiing and travel so on . my parent are also spending their time to travel , to play golf and to get a their hobby . they are enjoy their life more than me . therefore , i want that situation a my parent who prepare their future when they were young .
