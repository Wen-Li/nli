i strongly agree with this statement that there were very few car in use twenty year before when compare to today . earlier there wa very le population in the world , the number of people use the car also very le at that time . the wage of the public or employee also very le , way of income is very le because of lack of resource . there wa lack of technology . in olden day even though they are financially strong enough the doe not want to buy a car because they feel it make them lazy . since the time of increasing the population all over the country the usage of the car also increasing because a the year are passing away the technology is increasing , the resource are increasing and the wage of the employee also getting increasing . now a day there are somany way to earn the money . in olden day cost of the car is very high but now it is came very much loe and it is with in the reach of a middle class family . sso most of the middle class family also buying the car . this rate increasing rapidly in the city mainly because of pollution . this is true that so many people in the city are buying the car because of heavy pollution from the vehicle . the other reason is to live their life luxuriously with their family . there are some other reason those are the travel agency . most of the travel agency are using the car to provide transport fecilities to the public . local taxi also one of the reason to use more number of class now a day . to conclude it , this difference is mainly because of change in the way of lifestyle from the earlier time to now and the developing the technology which getting down the price of the car .
