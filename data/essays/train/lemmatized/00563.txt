i totally agree with this statement . there are lot of advertisement in the world . all the advertisement about their good contains the great exaggeration about their good . in my experience , i wa young and i wa in korea , i watched the advertisement about new robot toy . at that time on the tv , it show the flying robot that i can control it and make it fly . i wa really surprised about flying thing because i wa young . so i bought it at my birhday and tried to make it fly . it did n't fly . it wa really big shock for me and i could not believe any advertisement from that time . in our life , we can see many case like mine . in addition , i saw a advertisement about new restaurant , it say that if we come at birthday , it is free and there are alot of beneficial thing for birthday people . so i went to that restaurant with my friend on my birthday , i expected that free food and many thing . but i could n't get any service or beneficial thing . they said , it wa only one week event so i checked the advertisement paper , it did n't mention about one week event . i wa really angry but i could n't leave that restaurant . in my opinion , we can not stop them . because it is one of the good way to make people come to their restaurant . but we can think ourselves that we know it is fake . so do not expect that much , we have to get ready for a shock . when we just do n't believe the advertisement , we can have some benefit luckily , and it make u happy . so my conclusion is , we know it is not really true but we can just go and have fun there .
