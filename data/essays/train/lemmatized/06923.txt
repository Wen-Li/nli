selfishness is probably inner in the human-kind . but a human started to live in community , they learnt to share their common , space and time with each other . with the appearence of the industrial revolution and theory and idea like the capitalism , people tended to come back to a kind of primary form of selfishness . this is not a condamnation of the capitalism , it 's the way it had been used for a while , especially by young people . during a certain period of time , the early twenty for example , young people used to think , and people around them used to make them think , that because they were young , they got their life to live in integrity in a selfish way and that the whole world belongs to them , they just have to live . this way of life appeared especially in rich country . it does'nt mean that poor country did n't know this way of life , they did , but later . some decade later , young people started to feel that even if it 's ok for them , even if they have every thing they ask for , it wa n't enough to get a balanced , healthy life . young people nowadays , and at the contrary of the last generation , know that , to make your life better , you need to share your time , your money and your love with the others , that they need to make people around them happy to be happy . so people who say that young people do not give enough to help their community , are very far of the truth . in all the war , earthquacks , tornado , ... and all the catastrophies that our planet lived and still live during the last century , nobody is giving away , sacrifying life , money and time such a young people are doing . of course they are always irresponsible young people around the world , but the universal tendance today is for sharing everything .
