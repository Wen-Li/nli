i agree with the idea of ' successful people try new thing an take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' .the idea is true because of this 3 reason : they are aiming to enjoy from life , they always want improve their ability and lastly they are getting bored from what they usually do . this 3 reason make them succ first reason is that they are aiming to enjoy from life . for those people living in a world mean , making research about thing that they do n't know and that they have n't heard of about . and making research about new thing cause them succesful second reason is that they always want to improve their ability . for example : last time in my project i used item that are maid by me to express about the place that i wa presenting in my project and i succeed . next time i will take photo and will use them in my project although i am not good at taking photo ; but i decided to take photography lesson . at the end i will learn how to take photo at least . learning new thing cause people to be succeed . lastly , for successful people to take risk is an enjoyable event that cause their adrenalin to move up , by this way they will be away from their routin life that they used to live and it will bring joy and happiness . this happiness and joy will cause the successful in life , as a conclusion the idea of trying new thing and taking risk rather than onyly doing what they already know how to do well cause people to get success at the end .
