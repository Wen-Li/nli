some believe it is better to know a lot on a specific subject or on a specific major , some other belive , instead , it is better to have broad knowledge of many accademic subject . for me , i can say with confidence that it is better to know many subject in dept . i have studied an enjeneering and i almost always take course connected with my major , so course related to enjeneering . if i have a conversation with other enjeneers i feel good and i am sure about what i say . you know , in situation like this i think that school did a good job and i think , also , this is great for my job . but if one day i meet someone and we begin talking about somenthig else_ if he or she want to talk about literature_ or art_ or music_too bad , i can not ! so , in this situation i feel not prepared , not well belanced a a person and this is the biggest reason i think it is really important to study many and many other subject . i think also that school that ha an important influence on the background of students_life , must try to prepare belanced people who can look at theirs futur without fear . if i have time in the future , i will want studying by myself what i have not studyied up to now .
