i think i agree with this statement . as far a i am concerned , i think that there are two idea which can support this statement . first , recently environmental protection awareness ha been rising rapidly . people nowadays realize that ailr pollution is getting worse and worse because of car . thus , in order to give thier generation a better environment to live , people may begin to decrease driving car to the place they want to go . insteaed , they will start choosing public transportation , such a mrt , tran , and bus , to get to the place they need to go . moreover , the payment for a car is not cheap at all . for example , when you get a car , you have to pay for the oil and repairment . i dare to say it will cost you much money than spending money on taking public tranportations . second , oil is becoming le and le though scientist have done thier best to dig oil and find where oil can be . oil is one kind of natural resource and the formation of oil must be very long , so it is not limtless . however , oil is essential for car . without it , people can not start car at all ; then , people will reduce using car step by step . i think that the above i write can explain why there will be fewer car than today . just remember that quantity of oil is limted and one day it will be gone , and the government have spent amouts of money on establishing public tranportations . where do the governmet get the money to create pubic facility ? it is from peolpe who pay tax . so , we , people , have to enjoy what we have invested and keep a better life for our next
