yes i completely agree with statement that in next twenty year we will defintely have a fewer car than there today . . i agree with that statement because i have strong supported reason for this statement to prove . . the main reason for this is nowdays every country and every place on the earth is polluted with harmful gas produced by the car and other vechiles . . and this gas can cause lot of damage to to the world . . so this can damage the environment . so reduction of car are necessary to reduce the pollution and if we want to live in this homely planet we have to reduce the car so by reducing the pollution . . and the other thing is that all country are reducing the production of harmful car in this world . another reason is that ther will be le car than now is . every country is developed so another mode of transportion may be changed to this entire planet car may replace plane or helicopter and etc . . so in this fast developing era car may change the common mode of transpotation to other mode of transportation and this developing every thing is uncertain . to change the mode of transpotation another reason is that there will be a lesser car a now is that people want to live a life better life than usuasl than before so they dont to change the mode of transpotation a now that mean they dont to change climatic condition now . so they strongly feel that car can damage the world condition a lot . if we use car which can cause pollutoin so they tend to change the habit of the people so i strongly feel that in next decade or two there will be a fewer car in use than there are now
