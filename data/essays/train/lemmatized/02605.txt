although there is alittle time for young people , because of the high amount of reponsiblities , work , and maybe we can say school ( if they were not graduated ) any one can order his time and hime self to get the benefit by doing alot of thing in ashort time like studying , working , and helpeng their communitien or famillies , but with out ordering time the person will lose the ability of working well , the person will not have time that he can not do any more work . ordering time is the best way to relax and to have time for every thing . so , the person will do alot of thing like finishing his work , then having time to study , after that he will have the time to see his parent , relative , and friend and ofcourse he will be able of doing any thing with them , a what i had observed and saw from my friend . he wa ordring his time will . so , he done alot of work that i wa unable to finish , he wa going to his secondry school , then after finishing his class , he wa going to work with his father , after that he wa taking care of his brother , at last he able to set with his parent and help his community . a aresult of ordering his time . on the other hand , with out ordering time the person will lose time and he may lose alot of work , like what wa happened to one of my friend , he wa wasting his time , for that he wasnot able to see and help his community . a aresult from having no time at all . he wa going to his school in the morning , then when he come back he wa going into his bed , then he wa wakingup from bed in the midnight . so , his life wa not organized . in my opinion i think that young people will have alot of time if they organized themselfs well . a aresult of that i advise every one to order his time forthat he will have abetter life and he will help his or her community .
