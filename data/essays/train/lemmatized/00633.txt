in my opinion in twenty year a lot of thing may change . as regard the car i think that since one of the major problem today is the pollution produced by car maybe in the futureb car will be fewer . there ha been a lot of conference about this probem , in these year . i do not believe that in twenty year there will be car with a different kind of carburant , able to respect the nature , because maybe that special car will go too slow and the people would not buy them . in my personal opi that is more probable a solution could be car that doe not destroy the natural ambient it will not happen and it would bo too expensive . but i think that in 20 year i think also that in the future , for the increasingly amount of the population the traffic will be a real obstacle for worker , it will become easiers for everybody to take a plane . the plane will be le expensive and they will go more and more fasters . thanks to technology a lot of new future machine , a part from the plane , will be discovers , so the car will be abandoned . since the life in the 2006 is caracterized by the fact that nobady ha time enough , oll the everyday situation are becoming faster and faster so people in 20 year will `` run '' for all the day . for this reason a car is not sufficent . if i think about the world in the 2026 i can see a sky full of plane and air structure , and no car at all . maybe everyman will have his own personal plane and the car will be considers a an old nice object for aa art collection for exemple . .
