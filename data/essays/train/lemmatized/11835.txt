some people say that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , on the other hand someone say that for a student is more important to learn fact and not to understand idea and concept . the fisrt group may give some reason to support their idea , because fact can be consider a logical conseguence of the idea and the concept , and if a student understand the idea and the concept he can learn fact easylier and quicklier . the second say that for a student is more important to learn a fact and not to understand idea and concept , because the history is do by the fact and not by the idea or the concept . as far a i 'm concerned , i perfectly agree with rason of the second group of people , in fact i think that for a student is more important to learn fact than it is for them to undestand idea and comcepts , because in my opinion fact is the application of idea and conception , and if a student learn fact he ha more help to understand the concept . for example if i must study the second world war for me is more important learn fact and not what idea or what concept there are under the fact . for example if i study the german 's invasion of poland i learn the fact , but from this fact i can understand that the nazism 's project is to conquist all the world and this project start from the poland . finally i think that a student must learn the fact because from fact he understands the idea and the concept that there are under the fact and not more important in the history text for example the question is about the fact and not about the idea , this is only an example , but it is another reason for me that is more important to learn fact .
