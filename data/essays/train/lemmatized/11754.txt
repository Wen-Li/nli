i am completely agree with this following statement ; it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . but learn fact it is also important first of all , i think that the student need to understand idea and concept in order to develop is intelligence and permit also to have thinking more advanced than to learn fact without understand . for example in professional life the student will be need to understand idea and concept . in fact , the firm need employee with thinking , a employee to be able to understand the environment , the consumer in order to find solution , to resolve problem moreover , in private life , we need also to understand idea and concept for every event in you life . for instance , when you have a child ask him about a question you are able to answer more easily . or when you have a problem in order to resolve him you must to understand before . to sum up my idea it is more important to student to be able to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because in the private life and professional life society need people with reflexion about a various subject . however , learn fact it is good for the memory of the people , that 's with student must to work in this two way ; understand idea and concept and learn fact . for example , learn fact it is good for the culture and the history . in fact it 's good to understand the history but it very important to learn fact in order to don t forget the date , event ... to resume my idea it is very important to understands idea and concept for the reflexion student but learn fact it also important sometimes for the culture or history in order to the student do n't forget the history and for the memory
