nowadays , successful people always like to try new thing and take risk in their life . i totally agree with this statement for some good reason . first of all , people like to say that `` it is never too old to learn '' . we are still too young to stop trying and learning new thing . if we never try , we will never know what gonna happened . eventhough sometimes we would not be successful a a result of trying new stuff , we still can face the bad situation bravely and treat it a our treasure experience in our life and we will learn from it a well . for example , i came to canada with my family two year ago , since we are not english speaker we had to learn english from `` abc '' . eventhough that is really hard for u but we never stop our step . and my grandma is 80 year old now and she still want me to teach her how to use internet . second , our world keep changing ever single day . if we stop learning , we will really fall behind so we must keep going for ourselves and our next generation . since everything in the world need people to create an develope , we should never stop learning and exploring new thing . third , in my point of view , some people give up or stop learning thing because they are too lazy to try and they think that will be hard for them , on the other hand , they are kind of satisfied by their own situation . maybe that is really fine for them to stop going , but they will lose so many chance to be successful . maybe they will not suffer a lot from some hard experience but at they same time they will lose the chance to experience the exciting process . because no body can foresee the future so we should try our best and built a beautiful life for ourselves . : )
