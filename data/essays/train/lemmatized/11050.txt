there is a famous english proverb that illustrates the scope of this topic , it read : `` he is a jack of all trade , ... but a master of none . '' what this proverb essentially implies is that it is not possible to attain mastery in several field , one can only specialize in one . the statement of the issue being discussed epitomizes a very paradoxical situation that we a human being encounter throughout the course of our life i.e the path of mastery or the path of overall education . it is often a a child you are asked the question : `` what do you want to be when you grow up ? '' . the child being ambitious and idealistic at the phase of his life would base his reply on his passion for a particular subject . well , it is true that most well educated human being eventually settle down to choose a particular career based on their academic strength and prowess . when pusuing a higher education we are made to choose a subject that we wish to major in and probably the subject that will encompass our career in the future . we are forced to academically pusue a mastery in a particular field of life a this field shall play a vital role in determining our future , our social strength and our monetary power . it will help in determining what we will be in the future of the socio-economic struggle among u , which evidently ha become an essential part of our survival . it is a fact , we need to attain mastery to build our success , we need to excel at something to prove our ability thus developing specialization in a particular axcademic subject is essential . there is however , a counter-claim to this argument , a claim which defines the power of a well rounded , overall education . possessing a fundamental and broad knowledge in every walk of life and having an opinion on all matter . a person who follows this ideal is a person whom i would define a a `` jack of all trade '' . through my argument i do not undermine the power of a well rounded academic back ground , what im trying to imply is that education is what is inculcated at the grass root level . acquiring a broad knowledge of various academic field is covered at the elementary and sub-secondary level of education . it is after this stage , that a human being ha metamorphosized from this phase of his life into a phase which is ready for mastery , he is in a position to choose . the option are always open in life , but it is our duty to choose and master the option that we most strongly believe in . this is a trait that will help u stand out a the master of our field and give u purpose in life . we were born to make a difference in this world and by attaining mastery in one field of academia we can fulfill our duty to ourselves and humanity .
