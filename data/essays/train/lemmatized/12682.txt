some people may say that they need to broaden their knowledge in many different subject to get more chance . but i believe that it is more important to be specialize in one specific subject than knowing little about everyting because of two reason . which is that it is a waste of time and effort and that the company want a specialist in certain field . first of all , studing all the subject that you do n't need is a waste of time and effort . people are living in a busy life and i think that they should put these effort and time to their major . for example , in korean high school we have a lot of subject that you do n't really need . students do n't understand why they are learning this but they are studying for these subject just because of the exam . i think that student should instead put their time and effort in the fun activity or hobby that they like to do . secondly , thesedays the company need specialist who are good at one specific field . this is becoming popular because most of the college have many program that the student can just get into college with one subject that they are really good at . these subject can be such a computer skill , launguages ability , art and ect . thus , if you are way better at english than most of your friend , you can develop on your language skill to be better at it and you will become a specialist that many company want to hire . because of these reason i think that having a subject which you are extremely good at is better than being just good at many subject . i believe that each every one ha different interest and talent which should be encouraged to be develop .
