i do not think that it is always the case that young people enjoy life more than older people do . for example teenager live at that age a very traumatic period of their life and normally they hate themselves , hate others , hate their life , hate everything ! so i definitely do not thing that they enjoy life more than others do . young people take risk , i think that is the difference , they want to explore , know , achieve thing and sometimes they take their life for granted . yes , sometimes it is true that young people know how to have more fun unlike some older individual but it doe not mean that it is always like that . older people have experience , know more about some thing , about how life is and i think that the more you know , the more you have experienced life , the more you value thing , you stop taking thing for granted and give them the right value , you appreciate more because it ha taken a lot of effort in order for you to have what you have . they can enjoy life more simply because they have more memory , either happy or sad but they have them , memory that enrich their everyday life , they have more people to love , more story to tell , they have lived more . how would you enjoy life at the most if you have not lived enough ? if you do not really know how life is ? of course there are case in which older people are bitter , angry at life because they have suffered a lot but that doe not mean that more experienced people can not enjoy their life a much or even more than unexperienced person . it all depends on the way of life you have , how grateful you are , how much love you have given and received , what you have learned in life , etc . it is definitely not a matter of age , it is more likely , i think , a matter of personality and the circumstance that surround or have surrounded your life .
