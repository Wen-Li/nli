in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today actually , i do not agree with this statement . the world is growing . the city are expanding . and the world population is increasing . people need transportation to transport from one site to another inside the city and even outside . i agree that there are variety of transportation . for example , bus , metroes , and airplane . but usually people like to drive . they like to have there own car and travel with there family through the country . some country , there are no metroes . and some country have minimal number of bus . in my country , we do not have metroes , small number of bus and we have only one airplane company . in my country , we are not used to use bus or even taxi . we usually use our car . cars can not be replaced by other transportation . some people will not feel comfortable without using a car especially their car . other transportation can help in decreasing crowdeness but that doe not mean that they will replace the car . mostly . everyn body in the entire world would like to have a car even if he or she transport by other than car . i think reduction in number of car in use will be challenging . and i think it will take more than twenty year to decrease the usage of car in my country in the entire world .
