the issue stated by the topic is whether the student need to understand the idea and concept rather than learnin the fact alone . this is a very important issue because it is related to the student and the application of the knowledge they have gained in their school . i completely agree with the statement because of various reason . firstly i feel that understanding the idea and concept is better option because the student will be able to judge by himself whether the fact are true or not instead of asking the student to blindly follow the fact which may create confusion in them . secondly by getting familiar with the idea and concept . the student will better understand the outcome of them and inturn will be able to apply them correctly . for example if the student understand the concept of gravity thorougly rather than just knowing that all the object throw up will come down , the student is more convinced and be careful with the object he is handeling . another point why i feel that understanding the idea and concept is the right option for student is because they can retain the fact for longer period of time . for example if student understand how the fact have obtained instead of just what are the fact they can always apply the concept and get fact . but if they learn only fact then if they forget them it will be difficult to remember . lastly schooling is never complete if the student come out of the educational institution with just gaining knowledge of the thing , that is just knowin fact . if the student are not able to appy them in their daily life then there wont be any meaning for the knowledge they gained . in conclusion i believe that student should understand the idea and concept thorougly thaught in their school and not just merely learn the fact inorder to fulfil their education and inturn to evolve a a complete human being and be usefulto the society when they come out .
