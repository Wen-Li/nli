life come only once , hence one must enjoy each and every moment in his life , and live without that voice in the back of his mind that say i didnt enjoy his life one a much a i should have had . life is like a flower which ha to bloom and which want to enjoy in the sun . youth is the stage in life when one ha the time of his life . at youth the young man is full of energy , at a tender age he spend most of his time playing with doll , drawing or anything which amuses him . then in teenage , young people enjoy amongst their friend circle . not only that these young people will try to enjoy each and every time of their life by doing the most absurd thing which one cant even ever think of , like me when i wa young - me and my friend would occasionally ring the bell of our neighbour and run away . every one in his life might have done something or the other equally thrilling in their life . if you look at it you will mostly believe that one enjoying day are only during the youth , but who said that old people can not enjoy ? their life arent over they still can have fun . take my grandparent for example . just because they are old doesnt mean that they can not have fun . my grandparent still enjoys by visiting place which they couldnt at young age because of education . although i know that due to these illustration it seems that young people have an edge over the young one with respect to enjoyement and if i were questioned if `` young people enjoy life more that olden people do '' , then i would say thats a difficuly question my friend , the older people had an equally enjoyed when they themselves were young , similarly to the young one , i would say enjoyement isnt over for you guy a yet , u have the rest of ur life to live ...
