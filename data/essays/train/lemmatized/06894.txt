learning method , nowadays , are different . students are more able to understand idea and concept a they have more support , for instance book , and the `` new '' one , internet . .. however , for a student the purpose of the course is not always clear . in this way , he can understand more precisely a concept or an idea by using the support and therefore by increasing his knowledge by his own . in my opinion , a student will be more interested in a subject in which he know the basis rather than in a subject that he will only know the fact . understanding subject will be clearer and easier for him to discus , to argue for and to interpret . he will be self-confident on what he talk about and will be able to respond to question , a the subject will be appear more sustainable for him . learning fact is not easy for child . it may seems to be a succession of important thing to know but without meaning for the child . the student must be lost and confused on the subject a he will not understand from where information come from . moreover , if a student understand idea and concept he will be more able to take in mind those thing for a long time and will be able to use it in the future , whereas , if he only understand fact , the subject must stay in mind for a short term period . to conclude , from my point of view , learning fact is the basis of confused knowledge , whereas understanding idea and concept is the starting point of a intellectual culture .
