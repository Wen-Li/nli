first of all i think that is important for everybody have a good knowledge that is necessary for live , for discus and resolve problem or situation of the normal life . so after this , i think is better to have a knowledge composed by differents subject than to specialize in just one specific subject . it s important to have a mix culture for to be able to think , to discus , and to partecipate in differents conversation . you need an education that should involve mathematics , philosophy , music and history , .. and many others . you can specialize in one specific object that you feel more able to do , or just because you really like . but it s necessary to have a background before . for example i am a musician . i have studied many year music at school with other many differents subject . but after many year i felt able to choose one , to decide which i like more than other . i have invested a lot of time to study music . but i always need to read , to be with people that are studying something differents . you don t need just to know how you read the music for to be a really good musician . you really need to read , to go to the teather . . everything should improve your ability , your specific subject for what you are investing a lot of your time . it s better have both , have the possibility to be educated with a background of knowledge untill that moment where you feel able to choose one specific subject . so i think you need to do both of this passage . . in my opinion these two different approach must be both present . one follows the other . i think it s not right to choose one of these two approach , or say that one is better than one other .
