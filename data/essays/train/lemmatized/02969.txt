i do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . many young people nowadays do not pay enough attention to other people need but are preoccupied with their own problem and activity . on the other hand they use facility given by their community like youth center and sport facility and even school which are mostly run by the community . this stress the point that many young people only take instead of taking and giving back . they do not seem to realize that most of the facility they use every day are run or at leat supported by their community . from these point one can draw the conclusion that young people should defenitely do something in order to give back to their community . examples of what they could do for their community are on the one hand helping to keep all these facility they use everyday running thus helping to keep place like park , public transport and sport facility clean and intact . on the other hand they should also see what they can do for other people and their interest and need . young people could e.g. help older people with their shopping , go to elderly home and read book or newspaper to the people or play game with them . that way they would socalize with other group and give back to the community what they give to young people . also , young people should try to contribute to local issue like politics and demonstration in order to support their community in important topic . through these activity they would improve the living standard everyone is getting profit from now and that they are getting profit from in the future . to draw a conclusion young people should give more of their spare time to their community in order to socialize and get into contact with other group of people and also to give back part of the effort adult make to have the younger enjoy their environment and facility .
