i absolutely agree with this statement . to learn anything new , you have to know the idea of this thing . in other word , the learner must know the benfits fo this thing and why it is important to be known ? . in other thing , the learner should have an idea of the history of what he learns . because if he knew it origin , he can decide how it importance a well a he will get a good comprehension of the thigs . after that , he can build the idea which depend on the main idea . on the other side , if the student learn fact while they do not have a sufficient understood about the idea , they will misunderstand some of the background of the fact . and here are an example support my opinion . consider the concept of interrelationship between different community aspect that they may in some concern be the eventual criterion of demonstrating what those idea may have .
