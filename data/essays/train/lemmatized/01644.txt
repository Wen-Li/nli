i think that young people today have a lot of time for all . today generally a child ha a good family , a good clean house with a beautiful garden , he ha money and much time , generally a good situation around himself . the tipical day of the young people is more or le this : first , the young people today go to school in the first part of the day , they stay in classroom for 4/5/6 hour and then they are freedom . second , in the first part of the aftenoon they make a homework for a small time and then ? they play football or go out for a shopping time or play with a bad machine that they call play station for all time and they do n't observe the world around u . and so in this day the youth life and the time pas . in the world , a lot of country are in difficolt . only the 8 % of the global people live like a normal people but the most part of the global people died for no food or no water . this is a great vision of the world situation but in every city there are some problem that young people could to see and help . every community organize the group to bring food to the people without home or a poor people in general in the street or for organizes the local event to stay together for few good moment . but the young people have a better thing to do . in my personal experience i think that help my comunity is good , some people are in difficolt for eat or sleep and with my group of friend we helping this people . when ? when we are free , after school or after homework . i do n't spent my time in a bad way i want to help someone . finnally i hope that in the world much more people helping their society with their time with their money and with their love .
