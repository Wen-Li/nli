i disagree with the statemment that traveling in a group with a tour guide is the best way to travel . one reason why i think it is not the best way is that a group contains to many different character and opinion . the issue is that people like different thing ; for example , if one is in a group , visiting a museum , some member of the group would rather focus on the really known painting , meanwhile , other people would rather rush thrue the entire museum to see all of it just incase they wo n't have enough time in the end and other may just like to look at one painting for an huge amount of time . keeping this example in mind , how would you sattisfay each and every character at a tour ? in my opinion it is not possible and i rather look at each painting , at an amount of time which is convinient for me and look just at painting i am interested in instead of trying to keep up with a group . add to that , if you take something like an entire trip , one would have to follow the tour guid and may miss some interesting place he might would have seen if he would have been by hisself or with just a few people . take my last trip for example , i went with my parent to san francisco and drove all the way down to los angeles . i planed the entire trip and focused just on my parent and my passion like amazing view over the bay , visiting monterey , driving thrue some dessert , driving across the golden gate bridge and visiting those nice little country city on the way down there . while we were in los angeles , we were mostly on the beach instead of visiting los angeles . just a few week later , my friend took a tour from san francisco to los angeles . first off al she wa cold in san francisco because she did n't expect this cold weather . we did n't expect it either but we did n't have a tour guid and could stop to buy a sweater for each one of u . furthermore she did n't have any idea what monterey looked like , she saw the bay bridge just from far away . the last horrible memory she told me wa that instead of watching sunset on one of those great cliff she wa chasing her group thrue los angeles and saw mansions of `` stars '' she never heard of . my oipinion is clear , i will never travel in a group led by a tour guid . by the way , my parent enjoyed our trip and think it is one of the greatest they ever had .
