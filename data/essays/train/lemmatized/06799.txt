the humanity ha experienced numerous series of development . but if it were not for new equipment that allowed for efficient hunting of animal , farming that made stable livelihood possible , and the development of internet that brought the world together , we would n't be living in the world so conveniently a now . the same thing could generally be applied to human themselves . thus , i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than focusing on what they can do well . only doing what one already know how to do well leaf no space for any further advancement . a story of mine would be an example . i used to be very weak in mathematics despite the fact that i try to solve a lot of problem . without knowing the reason , i went to a math academy where the teacher found the reason for me . i wa only solving the problem that i knew how to solve ; i wa avoiding hard one . thereafter , i try to solve whatever i confronted and became good at math . it is also a historically proven fact . if the wright brothers had n't tried to fly like a bird , or if they gave up in the progress because of the adversity and risk , the airplane would n't have been invented . if samsung 's lee geun-hee had n't tried semiconduct some decade earlier than any other company 's leader , korea would n't have been able to credit samsung for it assistance in the coutry 's development . some might argue with a famous proverb , ` jack of all trade and master of none ' , claiming that concentrating on what one know best is advisable rather than trying everything . yet ` failure is the mother of success ' rebuts that proverb . even when something is out of one 's specialty , it still is worth trying because that could possibly give the person new perspective and understanding . although it seems risky and need a lot of courage to take on new thing , one must proceed in order to success ; it 's the common characteristic of successful people . as is proven personally and historically , and by a well-accepted proverb , it could be said that trying new thing and facing risk bring success .
