i believe that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning only fact . in my opinion , there are several reason why idea are more important than fact . for instance , while i wa attending history course , which is often believed to be made only of fact , i realized that some event are common in different period . therefore , when i wa able to understand the idea and concept , i wa also able to catalog similar event in big caterogories and this way of learnig helped me in getting a good mark in the exam . moreover , while i wa attending the university i realized that the way of learning idea and concept is really imporant . for example , a course can explain with some example how to deal with certain issue . however , it may occur that a different issue occurs so , i believe that only whether you understood the idea you might solve this new issue . an example , that confirmed that idea and concept are more important than fact , is what happened last year during the electronic laboratory course . i and my friend were working on `` led '' , light emitting diode , and we were measuring the emssion of the light . we were using a particular instrument to get the measure when it stopped to working . we were worried because we knew that wa the only instrument to do that kind of measure . what is more we studied only how to use that kind of instrument and other type . our professor told u that also it wa impossible to repair it . we thought we lost all the experiment , but it wa not true . while we were reading the the manual we understood that that istrument wa only the combination of two well known instrument : a '' wave generator '' and '' amperometer '' . we got the idea . we were able to build our instrument and continue the experiment . we were really happy of what we had done and we understood that the we were able to finish our experiment ony because of ablity to abstract idea and concept that we had understood in the past .
