advertisements is a important part in selling product and a good advertisement will bring benefit . this statement is controversial , in the one hand the advertisement often show a good product , better than the other and the cheapest of the range . in the other hand , some brand are well known , ha loyal customer and doe not want to lose them by showing product better than they are . however , my personal point of view think that most advertisement make product seem much better than in the reality . firstly , before going any further , i would like to give an example which come in my mind , the washing powder on advertisement can fight against everything like ice cream on a jean or fruit juice pour on a tee shirt . moreover , the washing powder can wash efficiently in a cold water so people can save money . according to me , this example seems exagerate to sell a product . secondly , some advertisement put the best product in the advertisement but show the price of a low range product . the goal is to show that everybody can afford to have a good brand . everybody ha already seen a car advertisement , we can see the price written in big and the thing that nobody can see is written in small letter . thirdly , advertising campaign are very expensive , they use to call actor to show up the product , some professionnals are here to take the best photo they can and the best advertisement to show on television . for instance , when a child act for a cookie , he always enjoys the product and argue next to her mother to buy this delicious cooky . the advertisement want to reproduce the scene at home , and generally it work . in a nutshell , i am totally convinced that nowadays , to have market share , advertisement are definitely fake and they show product better than the reality .
