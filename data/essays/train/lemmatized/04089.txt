in the world , there is so many people who is successful . i believe that they succeed becuse they tryed todo new thing and take risk is make people to succeed . first , if peolple do only what they already know how to well , they will not improve . we have to make an effort and charenge new thing to improve . there is so many people who know how to do well the thing . it mean there is so many people who have same ability a them . therefore , people without challensing are same a others and they will not success . second , to try new thing and to take risk make u to know how to solve the problem . as people try to start new thing , they will expect the problem that will be happend . since people know what problem will be happened , they can prepare to have the problem and find how to make it better before problem happen . if people do only what they already know , they will not think about faillur . so if some problem occurs to them , it is hard to solve the problem . also once they gat some problem , they will depress more easily than those who expected what problem will be able to occure . becauser of these reason , i belive that to try new thing and take risk are more important than to do what they already know how to do well for success .
