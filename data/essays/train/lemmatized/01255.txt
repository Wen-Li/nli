there ha been a continuous change in the world for several year . i think that the ongoning chage will continue for the following century . the change will have particular effect on daily subject like transportation , work life , education system and so on . in the light of this idea , i definitely think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . actually there are three main reason that will cause this decrease . first of all , the oil reserve on the earth ha been decreasing . the decrease in the amount effect the oil price . even in the last 3 year the oil price increased dramatically . i think that , this increase will continue according to the decrease in oil reserve on the earth . as the price of oil increase , the number of people who can afford a car will decrease and the total number of car will diminish . secondly , i think that car are not a good way of transportation and in twenty year , other mean of trasportation will be invented . the car are not feaxible to be used in both over the sea and in the air . as the requirement of the humankind increase , they will search for more flexible mean of transportation . for instance , flying vehicle can be invented in twenty year and that can be very feasible to used . therefore the car requirement will decrease and there will be le vehicle called ` car ' . lastly , by the spread of internet and it tool , the requirement for transportation may decrease and a a result the number of car can diminish . since internet is widely used both in our transaction and eduation , in twenty year , student attending their lecture from home may increase . actually , this system ha already been started to be used in several country and appreciated by the user . furthermore there is a new consept called `` telecommuting '' which mean doing your job at home by mean of phone , internet and fax . this system is very suitable for several job today . to conclude , i think that the use of car will decrease in twenty year . according to the decrease in the oil reserve , increase in the requirement of flexibility and spread of internet all over the world will have particular effect on the number of the car in the traffic .
