i do agree with the statement . it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . having broad knowledge of many academical subject offer the student to conceptualize a wider range of subject and information from the world that surround them ; student that get broad knowledge , know where to get whatever information they need under a given situation that might raise in their professional life . students get during their academic study , information about bibliography reference , knowing where to look for a broader set of issue than whose specialized for just one thing . the brain can hold a limited quantity of information . from every day 's life , we aquire huge quantity of it . when specializing in one specifical subject , if we dont usually practice it in a daily basis , we might tend to forget about important thing related to that specifical subject we 've been prepared for . although with broad education , student would tend to forget even more than with specialized education about all the different subject , they get to conceptualize the most important basic of each . even if specializing into specifical subject can maximize how a person will solve a problem , and give an indepth analisys in his own area , if his professional area becomes obsolete by any reason , ( technological mean , substitute activity ) they then become obsolete for working in different area . we can also add another reason that is ; what if the professional becomes tired of working in the field he academically specialized ? ... would have to get academical study again in a different professional area ! in example of this , if someone whose grade ha been into the telecommunication field , and there one day get tired of working in telecommunication , router , switch , command ! , he or her becomes practically doomed to keep working in that they specialized for , for the rest of his or her day . instead , if the student chooses computer science , there is a much wider range of possibility . he 's able to develop system in whatever area he want to work for , including telecommunication ! from a social point of view , specializing into one specific subject might lead to isolation . this can happen in way that the person get so specialized into something , that know nothing about the rest of humanity ; get not much to talk about , or even understand basic fundamental of different area .
