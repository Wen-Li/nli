in order for a good company to sale it product , the company us advertisement . sometime advertisement help sale the product brilliantly , an sometime the advertisement can just be uneffective . in the following paragraph i will give an example to illustrate if yes or no a advertisement make product seem much better they really are . the important question when a producer make a advertisement for his/her product are : who are the consumer , and doe the advertisement after being seen by the consumer will make the consumer want to buy the product ? the producer must make sure that the advertisement give the perfect information of the product like : what do the consumer will gain with the product , is the product benefict and positive for the consumer , or is the product usable for a long period of time . .. for example , in mc donald commercial or subways commercial they always talk about the taste . they always show a big hamburger or sandwich really great looking good . nevertheless , they will never talk about how many fat in term of calorie people are going to put on their body , or how those extra calorie are going to damage their body . they dont have enough time ( considering that advertisement are supposed to be short and straight to the point ) to tell all the truth about the product . so , they always debate the best part or side of the product . the advertisement always show the best part of the product , what you gain now by consuming the product , but never tell the what is going to happen after using the product . consequently , i truly beleive that the most advertisment make product seem much better than they really are because they never give the total perfect information about the product while advertising the product .
