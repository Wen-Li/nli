i disagree with the prior statement for several reason . when we say that is is better to do this or that , we should ask ourselves : better for whom ? is it better for me , for the others , for society a a whole ? i think that altough a broad knowledge of many academic subject can be fruitful for individual , society rely more and more on specialized knowledge . and this is why i disagree with the statement . the first argument is that if a society value knowledge , and ours doe , then it should realize that the pursuit of knowledge is fostered by intense research in area that become by necessity the object of further and further specialization . to increase our knowledge about thing , be it nature , or the social realm , or just abstract math , we need researcher to constantly go beyond what they already know . it is only by being at the forefront of a given discipline that we can gain more knowledge about it . the second argument in support of specialized knowledge is that we , a a society - even though there are relevant exception - , do not pursue knowledge only for knowledge 's sake . we use knowledge in order to satisfy an objective , be it the improvement of our society , or of our health , or whatever it is we want to improve . doctors want to heal people , engineer want to build bridge . most of our society 's need depend on specialized knowledge . broad knowledge of many subject can serve the spirit , but the well-being of modern society requires more than well-educated , well-rounded citizen . last but not least , our society , which we value , a we have already said , need to be sustainable in the long term . sustainability - economic , social , ecological - is a complex issue and we a a society need to educate people that should be able to treat this complex phenomenon . these are some of the reason why we can say that specialized knowledge is better for our society and therefore that is is better to have this kind of knowledge than having broad knowledge of many subject . that said , individual should be interested in area in which they are not specialized , because thirst of knowledge is part of being human and it make our society richer in variety and more interesting .
