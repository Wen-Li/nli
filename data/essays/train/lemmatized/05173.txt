`` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , i comletly belive in this statement because i think one can not be successful by following other people . to be successful one ha to think out of the box , he ha to break the cycle of following the same routine over and over again . in order to be successful in life one ha to take risk . but first he need to define this term risk for himself . risk can be life ending or it can be carrer ending . for instanse let say that there is a man working a a stunt co-odinator in hollywood his recoganition in the industry would only be of just another stunt co - odinator . so in order to be famous and successful he ha to do something that somebody ha never seen or done before , he ha to do something spectacular which will gain him popularity , now that include risk in it because he ha to do something that other people ha never tried to do . so performing that kind of stunt would mean risking his life to death but still he ha to do it to that one bit extra , to be successful . and the other kind of risk would be carrer ending however it would not have that life risking element but it can end carrers let say a bussinessman who is the owner of a pizza restraunt . let say till now he is just just another guy with just another pizza shop in the market . so to be famous and successful he ha to do something extra , he ha to take that risk so he introduses a new recipie for the pizza . ther will only be 2 way out of it first the coustomer will like the pizza or they will not like the pizza , if they like it he is famous or if they do n't his carrer is ended . so the conclusion to this part is that to be successful you have to go that one extra bit , you have to think out of the box and you have to try and do thing that other have not done .
