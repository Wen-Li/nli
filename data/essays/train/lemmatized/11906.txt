i do not agree with the proposed statement and i will give different example showing that young people nowadays are not a selfish a presented . first of all , i must confess that there is a common image of young people depicting them a more and more selfish , only worrying about themselves , playing on their computer and waiting for the diner to be ready . this picture is usually compared to the one presenting young people some decade ago , helping their parent at the shop , in the field or simply at home . however , my opinion is that this selfish image is too limited . more and more young people spend time and effort in social organisation . for instance , the number of boy scout in belgium is increasing . scouting is typically a place where people learn to care for their community . they organise activity to help homeless , they help at the church and take part in social event . another example is the social work which is more and more proposed by school to student . students are proposed to work for social organisation during a definite period of time . these social work are more and more popular , showing that young people are ready to give time to their community , a soon a they receive the opportunity to do it . furthermore , there are plenty of young people that each year leave their country during summer holiday to go and help other community in need . some are going to build school in africa , others entertain small child in asia , ... this show that young people nowadays care not only about their community but are also ready to spend time and money ( they usually pay their fight ticket ) to go and meet other community that need their help . to conclude , i think that this image of the lazy selfish youg people which is very strong in belgium a well a in other country should be corrected , lookimg at all the other young people who work hard to help their community and even others .
