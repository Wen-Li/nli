in my opinion , it is more important for student to undersantd idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . there are several reason why i agree with this statement . first , i think that understanding an idea and a concept is the first step to learn something new . for example , if you do not know the concept of `` evaporation '' how are you going to know the `` process of raining '' or maybe understand some chemical procress that involve the concept `` evaporation '' . secondly , i agree that student must know every concept of life because this is going to give them the power to solve new challegens without knowing the fact . for example , if a student know the concept of `` bowling something '' , them it is would be easier for he to cook something by just following the instruction . finally , i support this thanks to a personal experience i had lived . last year , whem i wa in high school , i had to take a science test and i studied hard for it . whem i started to asked it i stoped at the most important question and did not know how to answer it because of my lack of knowlegde in some sciencetific concept . to sum up , i believe that student must focus on learning all the concept the can and then worry on learning fact because everything go step by step and the first step here to learn a new fact , is first getting the idea and the concept of every new word . therefore , they would have the skill to learn more than student think they could do without knowning the concept .
