personally i disagree with that statement thinking of the global development of the car market . in order to support my opinion i would like to talk about different kind of aspect of the development and the importance of car in the industrialised and the developing country . so if we think of the industrialised country first , for me there is no sign or hint that there will be fewer car in the future . first of all it 's still an important status symbol and an important mean of transportation . the second point is probably due to the fact that society in europe and the us tend to get more and more individualised . in this context it mean that if you drive your own car you can be all alone and - for example - turn the music on that you want to . of course one could say the traffic will collaps very soon but if you recognise the investment of the governements in additional street and the development of navigation system making the traffic smoother and more efficient i think this development will compensate a great amount of additional car . another thing is that the production of car becomes cheaper and cheaper . additionally people are able to finance a car a lot easier than in former time due to the upcoming of leasing contract . finally the most important reason why i disagree with the statement is the development of country like china and india . more than two billion of people live there and still most of them do not have car . and if these country and the people living there do not cease to gain economical power in the future there will be a huge demand for car . a hint that support this point is the fact that a lot of huge car company invested a lot of money in the developing region of the world because it 's obvious that the future market for car lie in these country due to the huge amount of people that still do not own car .
