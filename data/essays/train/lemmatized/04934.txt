cars are the most common mean of transportation now-a-days especially in city where reaching the destination in time is of utmost priority . the number of car used is always increasing with the increase in population . but , i strongly believe that after twenty year , the number of car used will be much le than those being used now . as the number of car used keep increasing , the amount of air pollution caused by them will also be on the rise . this will cause global warming a a result of which , there would be many coastal area that will be submerged in the year to come . i feel that this will cause an awareness among the people and will encourage them to use public mode of transportation in order to reduce the number of vehicle causing pollution . another reason that i feel would result in a decrease in the number of car used is that the increased traffic would cause big delay in reaching the destination . the only feasible solution that i see for the traffic problem is the reduction in the number of vehicle . widening of road might help to some extent in solving the traffic problem , but beyond a limit it is not of much use . i feel that a a result of this , people will be forced to voluntarily give up the use of car inorder to meet their requirement on time . apart from all these reason , i also feel that there is a lot of risk associated with car journey . as an effect of this , more and more people might opt for relatively safer mean of transportation like the train . furthermore , in most of the case the train can be relied upon to take u to the destination on time . this is one of the primary reason for the increased use of local train in city where people are in a hurry to reach their office , school etc . . finally , i wish to conclude stating that the above mentioned reason are clear indicator that there could be fewer car used in twenty year when compared to those being used now .
