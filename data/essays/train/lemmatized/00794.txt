there are some argument wether having broad knowledge of many academic subject or specializing in one object . in case of having wide knowledge of many subjct is more benefial to most of student who have taken rather than student of who specialize one subject . the first of all , it mean many oppotunity that student choose their major or future . because every student touch many field of subject and . it help student choose their specific major . if they have many chance to have , it would be happened more le to confuse their future of to change their major . in long run , this method can save student 's time and money which relocated their goal . these experience will be good basis for having specific major . another reason is that broad knowledge help student in their life-time . having many background infomantion can help many bad or good circumstance . for example , opera which student had studied in class is more attractive to them than others who never study about opera . also others of subjuct is smilar with it . lastly , studying braod knowledge help student to see a various aspect of subject ( problem ) . unluckly , student who don ` t study about broad subject might have possibility to see one aspect to others . when i wa young , one of my classmate wa interested in math . he wa also genious in math . but he did n't do well in other subjuct and had problem with peer . becase he wa not interest in other part and peer . above the reason , the best option of way of studing subject is having broade knowledge of various academic subject .
