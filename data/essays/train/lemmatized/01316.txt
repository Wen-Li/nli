i think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . first of all , because to tralve in a group is usually organized by some touring company that design a guide , one can save time and energy for searching flight ticket , reserving room in hotel , etc , in particularly on one 's busy working schedule . in addition , one may not familiar with the area one is going to visit . it is easy to get the information from the guide . this is beneficial to know something about place one want to see in advance , which make one get more impression and enhance memory . moreover , while traveling , the guide will provide introduction on what one is going to view , for example natual scenics or historic building . they should know more that traveler . by doing so , one can increase knowledge and avoid the situation in which one doe not know anything but just look . finally , to tralve in a group provides one the opportunity to make more freinds . people travel together , live in the some hotel , have the same schecules in activity , which make people in the group contact each other all the time along traveling . our family like to travel on weekensd or in holiday . we perefer to take travel in a group . in this way , we can easily get ticket from traveling company on heavy traffic day . the tour guide is available to give u more information we do n't know before , which argment our knowledge from travel , especially for our child . and also , we established freindship with other traveler , whom we still touch now . thus , traveling in a group is the best way .
