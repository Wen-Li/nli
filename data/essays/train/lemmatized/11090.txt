i always try new thing in my life and i risk , because i do n't know if i will do these thing very well . in fact i have n't always success in the new thing that i try to do . but i agree with the statement that say that successful people try new thing and risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and i have some reason to sustain this statement . first of all , i think that if you do n't try or do n't risk , you 'll never know if you will be good to do a thing or if you will be happy to tryied this thing . for example , last month a friend asked me `` why do n't you try to sing in my music band ? '' . i though that maybe i had not the ability and the experience of sing and become a a leader in a music band , but he said me `` in my opinion , you must try or you 'll never know ! '' . so i trusted him and i decided to try . now i 'm very glad of this decision because i love sing and also if maybe i 'm not a very good singer i enjoy myself ! this is absolutely important . another example i can bring is about my sister . she 's very insicure and she ha n't much self-confidence . she like reading poem , but she did n't want to try to write one ! so my mother said her that she would be a good poet if only she wanted to try . now the poem of my sister are the best i ever heard . in conclusion i think that try to do a new thing is never a bad idea . in fact if also you will not have success you maybe will be happy !
