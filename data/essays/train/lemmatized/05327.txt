when it come to travel it is very significant to choose how to travel . in a group led by a tour guide or other way . i agree that the best way to travel is to use help of a guide . the most benefit of traveling in a group led by tour guide is that you are twice likely to learn more abot where you visit. a guide can help you to discover more detail . rather than observing superficially . you can have opportunity to benefit from a tour guide . due to their experience tour guide can have more knowledge than you have . for examlple i recently visited to spain . although i studied international relationship . after visiting to spain i acknowledged the fact that without using a tour guide help i could not comform my knowledge about spain whether or not correct . tour guide helped me tremendously to explore spain . in addition , you can remove risk of getting lost . i have experienced this reality . although it seems to have le possibility . if you do not use help of tour guide . because of lack of knowledge about place where you go . i visited to turkey year ago . i did not have idea about istanbul where crime rate high . i wa mugged . while i wa following criminal . predictably i got lost . it took two day to reach my hotel as a result i prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide . because it ha alot of benefit such a getting more information about where yiu go also remove risk of lost
