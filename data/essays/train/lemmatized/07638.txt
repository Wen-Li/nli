i do agree the statement that successful people try new thing and take ri rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , by accepting this statement i use to explain it by taking some example actually all are people but people with aim are le so they are the people called successful people , that people wil ame a success in every thing that what do they do . in my view people with aim could get a complete success than people witout aim , life with aim is a challenge thing and in that life ther is a thrill and enjoyment and then life will never get embrassed . according to this passage the successful person will always try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what already they know and how to do well that work , so that they can do the work in a new way . so this is the nature of the successful person , the person will always find a new thing which he doe n't know that , so that he will take it a a challenge and make it success . coming to example , i use to take example of myself that , i want to do my master in us so that i wa preparing for that , why iam using this example , i wa not settled financially but i wa trying it hardly by putting it a my aim and i will surely suceed in that , up to this age i did a routine thing that every one doing and made a success and i called a a successful person and a a successful person i use to make a new thing in my life that , making a master in united state of america , i think life is the better example for every thing so that i choose this example for this passage , and statement includes that successful person wil not do the work that already know mean he/she already now about that by doing again the samething that is a time waste and a succesful person will never do time waste he/she will utilise the time which he/she had so that he called a a sucessful person . so by using this example i agree the statement of the successful person will doe n't do the thing which already know and how to do well . so these all are my view and example to support myself .
