i agree with the statement that understanding idea and concept is more beneficial than learning fact to student . while understanding make student truely keep the idea , learning fact only make student memorize the idea . there are more advantage in understanding than in learning fact . in these day , the society need the people who can not only work with their knowledge but also apply it to the work place . if the people just memorized the fact , they might be a good worker but can not be a better worker . in contrast , if the people understood the idea and concept , they can develop the way they work by applying what they know . this is the same in the class too . in my case , i wa just memorizing math formula instead of understanding the fact . it seemed to work very well when i do the simple question . however , in difference to my expectation , i wa not able to solve the application question . so i started to understand the concept by asking my teacher . then , i could solve every question on the test and recieved the good mark . similar to my experience in math class , one of my friend experienced the advange of understanding in english class . she ha been always hard-worker . she doe everything with her best effort . in her english class , she worked hard on `` hamlet . '' she read the whole play twice and memorized important line and device used in the play . her teacher , however , did not expect the stuedents to study in that way . her teacher wanted his student to actually understand the play , and express the educated emotion about the play . on her first test , she recieved faily poor mark . so she started to look at the play in different character ' prespectives . then she recieved the good mark from her english teacher . through my experience and my friend 's , i learned that understanding is more important than just learning or memorizing fact . as shown above , when student just learn fact , they can not apply their knowledge into the deep study , while those who understand the idea and concept can get better and better a they study . thus , i think student should focus their study on understanding instead of focussing on memorizing .
