advertisements , the word that because it i start to be crazy . everywhere , everytime you will see or hear an ad . because the many time that you had saw it or heared it you start to lose thier truth . with the incresing in tchnology you are surround with ad from every where while you at the home , while you in the car , while you using the cell phone or the intrernet , and know while you using the puplic bathroom !! . i belive that the ad some time let me buy a product but when thay start to show again and again , i start not to trust on the product . in tha past , the ad used to tell the people about new product and that 's it . but know the show the same prduct but with an offer . this thing create a question , why they make an offer if thier product is succefel . i heared a say that said `` if your product cost 500 you should spend 1,000 for an ad '' did you see the multbly of the number . in this day the way that the company use to create an ad is so crasy . like nike , they spend more than 1,000,000,000 in thier ad . i do not mean that thier product are not good but i mean thy shoult trust thierself . athoer example hyandai when they made thier car with bmw car . or other company whene thay pay for a star to make an ad for them , and with this all the people who love this star will do what s/he did . it is seem cleare that the compnies start losing there customer because the hard work they do it to present thier product . and i think if they pay all this mone to improner the producte will be abetter than to spend it in ad .
