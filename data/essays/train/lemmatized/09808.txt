yes , i totally agree well , nowadays many people do not give enough time for helping their community especially the young people , because for example they are always busy going out with there mate , and going to club and mall , playing soccer , and many other sport , thats why they do n't have enough time i guess , thats what a young people at age of 10 to 18 year old people think about most of the time , well it actually depends on which country your'e talking about , because each country differs from the other , for example in this country , young people and old people help their community most of the time , like they clean the street sometimes , that 's what me and my mate did last week to make our area clean and good looking . in general , most of the young people do n't help their community in everywhere most f the time , well my advice for all the young people is to help their community no matter what situation he 's on , even if you helped your community for only one day , that would be really good , and about getting an execuse that you are busy , well i guess you can manage your time , like make a schedule , to know when to play and go out with your mate and when to help your community . it 's not a hard job to do , it will take only one hour or two hour maximum a day , that would be really good .
