life is worth to live . young people live it more lively and older people live it in a more plain way within their physical limit , but they woud have lived it lively when they were young . i agree with this statement that young people enjoy life more a compared to older people . young people are more energetic and more ambitious in their youth . they have the desire to bring sky down . young people have the quality of persistence that is to keep trying to achieve their goal . this ability of theirs help them to enjoy life and face all the hardship whatever come on their way . for eg. : youths always try new method of entertainment which is full of danger and risk . like bungee jump , car race etc . young people are always open to new idea and they have the desire to explore the world . they implement new thought in teir way of living and enjoy life to the full . at the same time old people are not able to enjoy more in life . they spend most of the time in the memory of what they did in their young age . they are even not physically fit to do all the activity which a youth can do . in the old age the ability of persistence reduces . old people dont have the desire to compete with the world to get the best . they always remain happy in what they have and in the way how they live . they are never open to new modern idea and are not able to enjoy life a compared to youth . finally i would like to say that , i am not against the old people . these are the people when young developed new idea which the youg generation of this age is following and enjoying .
