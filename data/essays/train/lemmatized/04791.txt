the basic purpose of using a vehicle is to move from one place to other . each one of u would like to travel comfortably and reach our destination quickly and safely . in order to have a comfortable travelling experience people prefer to use a personal vehicle rather than using a public vehicle . i disagree with the given statement and i personally feel that in the next twenty year , more number of car would be used than there are today . as people tend to look for more comfort rather than expences . in the next twenty year lot of thing are going to change in the living style . with the dovelopment of the science and technology at this rapid pace a lot of luxurius thing are going to be invented and the human life tend to become more comfortable and luxurius . car is also one of the primary comfort of the man . its a medium of transport the allows the person to have a comfortable journey . as time pass that man tend to grow economically and socially . a car ha become a symbol of social and economic status . an other reason i would think of more in number if car in the future is the increase in the standard of automobile technology and the competetion between the automobile manufacturing company . due to this competetion the automobile company start decreasing the price of the car and thus the car are available at a more cheaper and affordable cost . the decrease in the price of the car and increase in the economic status of the people result in more people buying in car and the is that more number of car will be in use in the next twenty year . finally , one more reason for people to use a car is to save the time . if you are using a public a public vehicle they will not be available at your time of need . there are some fixed timing and they follow that . hence , i disagree with the given statement and personally feel that the usage of car will increase rapidly in the future .
