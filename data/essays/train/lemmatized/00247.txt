i believe that fact can be learned in many different way and that school ha a different object than teaching student fact . a school 's duty is to both prepare the student for his entrance in real life , and to open a student 's mind through the constant teaching of concept and idea everytime more difficult . facts must be examined and fully explored in order to understand what lie beneath them . facts are nothing more then the final chapter of many cause put together . why bird migrate every year , why people cry when they are sad or why the sky is clear or cloudy ? all of these question could not be answered only by observation . the law of cause and effect studied during the past century explain u the importance to know the basic concept that rule the world . every phenomenon , every situation or consequence come from a precise cause . if we can know that cause then we are able to control the consequence , weather we want to repete it or avoid it . i believe that the primary objective of university , or school in general , is to give to their scholar a many information a possible . then , it will be the studient who will decide how to use these information . facts can teach you many thing , they can show you all the possibile outcome for every event , and they can help you to predict the future based on previous episode . but fact alone , i believe , can not be consider enough for somebody 's growth .
