having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is so important to me . we live in a globalization era that meens that many thing are happening at the same time : war in different country , economics impact , environmental disaster , medical advance . to understand those thing and to be actualize of those challenging the people have to focus their knowledge not just in one topic and open their mind to new topic . if that dont happend they wouldnt be able to follow all the world news that the medium is offering in these day . i think that thischange must happend since the elementary education : the school program speacilly in social study and history have to be more opened to the world reality . i consider important to have a background of our country history but dont forget about the world history also . when i had to decided what professional carreer i would i like to study i chose law . i consider that legal study give the student not just a legal framework but also a knowledge of other science like economy , philosophy , logical , sociology . considering that i have been working in invironmental law issue i have also need to open my knowledge and work in different area like agronomy , forestry , economy and sociology . after finishing my law degree i had decided to do a master not focus just in environmental issue but also in the whole sustainable development that our world need . that meens that once again i will convine mi study with other subject . that is a good example why i rather choose to to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . in addition of that i think that people who ha the posibility to travel around the world may invest their money and time in this adventure : this experience able one to improve the knowledge about other culture .
