in twenty year there will be fewer car in use that are today ! this is kind of complicated question , which deal with an complex answer based on different level . first of all , i will give a short introduction into the present situation of car and their number in the world , because in my opinion it is necessary for the whole part of that complex . after that i will give you pro and contra argument for each thesis . and in conclusion , i will summarize the fact , i pointed out . through the present paper my focus will be germany , because a wider concentration would be too long and too complex for that essay . since the development of car in the end of the 19th century and beginning 20th century by famous people like henry ford , car have become an important fact and enormous increase . in germany car are the most used and most important transport system , and it ha actually an great effect on economy , too - e.g. think about the importance of car export in germany . first of all , an argument pro more car in use in future base on statistical phenomenon . since the 1950s in germany and other western civilization there 's an great increase of car by nearly 5 % or more each year . it indicates an increase in the future . in opposite , some people say , the world or every certain region is economical limited , that mean there 's no space for an unlimited increase . second , people say the technique , computer and high-level knowledge become more important and will be more specialized , too . that ha a great effect to the car production , what , hence , ha an effect to the number of car , too . in opposite , if the ecomony will grow and if the high-technique will grow , there will be an another development , which replaces car . third , the more population is in germany or in the wolrd , the more car will be used . but of course we know there 's a stagnation of german 's population , nowadways . this are the major point and there are of course , a lot of more social , political and environmental aspect , too . in conclusion , i guess there will be a balance of the car in use and there will not be a large increase than today .
