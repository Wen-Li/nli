i first tend to agree with this statement and i actually hope there will be le car in the world , because pollution is a serious problem . according to me , in twenty year , they may be a problem about oil . we use so much of this right now that it might not be available in the next decade . if the oil becomes harder to find , then it becomes also more and more expensive . the richest people may then be the only one who will earn enough money to buy what is the main need to make a car work . i can even imagine people using their own bike instead . why not ? would it not be better for our earth ? moreover , new law preventing the use of car may be created . governements may take action to prevent married couple to own more than two car for example , or other thing like that . anything can be done , i think too many vehicle are on the road . since we are talking about close future , maybe we will wait much longer for change to be seen , because , let u also be realistic , more and more people own a car nowadays , it is indeed so comfortable to own our own way to move from place to place in such a short period of time . we need ten minute to go somewhere by car , and maybe fourty by foot . so it is hard to agree or disagree with the statement because all of this depends on how the world will turn out to become in the next few year . it depends on people 's state of mind , on politics , and on the decision that are going to be taken . but anyway , my point of view is fewer car would be a good and possible thing which would be likely to happen if each one of u are willing to make effort to help our planet .
