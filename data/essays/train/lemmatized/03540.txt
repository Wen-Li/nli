i disagree with the statesment that there will be fewer car in use than there are today for the following reason . first of all , huge number of people will buy their own car in twenty century . for example , thirty year ago , each family in japan can buy only one car . because it wa too expensive and people in japan wa not rich to buy many car . when my parent were child , there wa a only car for one family . thesedays , people in japan buy own car , so one family purchase two or tree car . i think same thing will be happen in idia or china in twenty year . more and more economy grow , more and more car will be purchased people . this example clearly show that huge number of people will buy their own car . second , technology development will give u more opportunity to ride a car . some people would say that we should not ride car because it ha negative impact for our environment . some sity office in japan do not allow citizen to ride the car inside the central city . however , some car maker which ha high technology already developed electric car . the car developed by the company doe not pollute the air . if erectric car is sold at same place with the car which we ride , many people would buy erectric car . and goverment would encourage to buy erectric car and ride those car . this example demonstrates that technology develpoment will give u more opportunity to ride a car . threfore , i strongly disagree with the opinion that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
