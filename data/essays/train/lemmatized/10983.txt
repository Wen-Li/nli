understanding the idea and concept than just learning the fact are more essential for student due the different interestes , understanding and efficiency . people have different interestes in different area . therefore , they focus on different area . sometime , people care more bout the reason than the fact . for example , they learn about the cause and effect of an event rather than jumping right to the conclusion and just learn the fact . by doing this , they get more familiar with the topic . besides different interestes , understanding towards the topic is equally important because once people understand what the topic is mainly about , they focus more on the additional information about the topic . also , when people understand the idea , it is easier to learn and memorize them . therefore , understanding towrads the idea are required because it make people think more and learn more . time is another significance factor . if people start on the unfamiliar topic right away without previewing or understanding the idea , it take much more time to acutually learn the fact form them . for example , if people preview their lesson before class , they know what the teacher is going to talking about . therefore , they can understand the concept in the class rihgt away without taking another reviewing time later . also , during the class time , they can ask question and have good interaction with the teacher . in conclusion , it is more important for student to actually understand the concept than it is for them to learn fact beacause of different interestes , understanding and efficiency .
