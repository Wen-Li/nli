idea over fact the concept and idea that are essential in the learning procees of any academic proffesion have to understand , and not memorized . the learning process implies a thought , ration , and analysis ; all of them essential in the absorption of information into our brain . i agree with this statement because the understanding of all those concept will beter prepare me in my proffesion . i believe that the fact come a a direct result of the concept and idea that are learned in the academic prepation for a career . we would not have fact if it wa not for especific science like mathematics , chemistry , and physic . a fact is only a series of number of a certain event or people . that are thrown by the person that doe the recolection process of information to do statistic . with out the process of understanding the concept and idea of a science we would not be able to create fact . for example we could be able to count or do statistic without mathematics . another perspective of fact is that we do not know if the fact are true or not ; the fact can be manipulated by personal or monetary interest . for example a pharmaceutical company may manipulate fact of a certain disease - to increase sale of the medicine that cure that particular disease - to create a highers revenue on the financial statement . i am not saying that fact are not important . i use fact all the time in my profession and job . but , we do not have to make fact the foundation of our knowledge in this world . a fact when it is given a an honestly , errorless , and doubtless source , it wil automatically become a most useful tool in our day-to-day life . the better understanding of idea and concept will make better fact and staticstics in the near future .
