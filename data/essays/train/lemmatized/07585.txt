i agree about this topic . i think it is more important for student to understand idea and consepts than it is for them to learn fact . if we did n't go to primary school and we did n't understand how we make a sentence with word we ca n't learn writing and reading . so i think understanding idea is important . for instance suppose that you have a computer but you did n't use it . before you use it , you must learn it is using . so firstly you should understand it is using . another example is that if you want to tke toefl you should take a course about this exam , you should understand all idea about this exam . after this preparing you can take this exam . in two example which were given above ; if you contact with an experiment you can be more successful . so i think if you want to be a successful person you should ask question to another people who you can trust her \ his idea . because i think intelligent people use his \ her mind but more intelligent people use another people 's mind not to make mistake . to become more successful in a short time you should ask other 's idea about your situation . in addition that understand all detail about fact you can imagine what it will be go on ? as a matter of fact that you can always ask question about your situation and understand all idea and concept and you can go right . if you ca n't understand idea you may not improve easily and in a short time . so it is an important part of life to understand idea . to sum up when you want to learn fact you search every side of it . do n't forget that every person have different idea and different looking side . so you always learn other 's idea from them or from book , than think them and solve the fact .
