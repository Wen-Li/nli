i think that this statement is true . indeed , successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they allready know how to do well . first , trying something new can only be positive . humans base their thought on their experience . however , if this experience is repetitive the lesson to learn from it are always the same one . experience need diversity to be usefull a situation that we come across in life are always different . doing something different from what we are used to can therefore be considered a an investment and every investment ha risk and return . for example , a painter who us a new painting technique ha more risk to fail in it task than if he stick to his old technique . however , he will learn a new way to paint that will probably pay off one day . another angle for this question is human nature . indeed it is in human 's nature to always take risk to improve . people improve their way of doing thing by doing them more efficiently and success can be defined a achieving one 's goal . people tend to perpetually improve . they find new way to achieve their goal more efficiently . they are considered successfull by their peer . so trying new thing and taking risk are in fact main factor of success . it is even truer today . in our society , everyone ha to have the latest electronic gadget . so being new is actually becoming part of the definition of success . in a word , successfull people take risk and try new procedure to improve their way of doing thing .
