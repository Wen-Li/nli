i am agree with the statement of young people 's not giving enough time to helping their community . it is my belief that , there are several reason that cause this situation . but , not only the young people , but also the environmental situation are the reason of this problem . this problem may be first explained by the change in the young people . it is my belief that we are getting more selfish from generation to generation and starting to think only ourselves . a few year ago , when our country is in a difficult situation , everyone ha the concious to do something for his/her country , but now we only think about what can we do for saving ourselves . one of the cause of this problem is the concious that is given to the young people in their home , by their parent . the most important place where a person learns most of the thing that he/she will use during his/her life is his/her home . in the older time , parent are more careful about this situation , but a the time pass , a the problem of the parent increase about their child , giving community concious is not anymore an important problem for the family . another place , that the young people are educated is school . at school , the teacher are the people who is responsible for teaching the importance of the community and helping to these child . teachers should give the concious , explain the good way of helping the community and describe the positive thing that they will gain by helping the community to the student . for example the teacher should explain the difficulty that the people have who have mental disordinarities to his/her student . by this way he/she can affect the student and cause them to want to help that people . we should start thinking about our community again and trying for someone else . helping someone else make the people feel proud of him/herself and cause to feel good . if we do not help our community , we can not expect something from our community . we should think our expectation , other people 's expectation and behave according to this . we should also help the next generation to gain this concious again .
