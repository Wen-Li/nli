i believe that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . one of the reason i adovacte is that we can learn more technology . i can learn some new thing when i wa trying new thing . for example , i did n't know how to do powerpoint , and we had a small speech in next month last quater . i could choice any type of way to show my speech , i could use poster or just talk , both of these two way that i already know and can do very well . but i wanted to make my speech more interesting , i wa thinking of using the powerpoint which i have never used before ; however , it could show all of my idea in it . therefore , i started to learn it . although it took me a lot of time to learn it , but the result i got wa better than i thought . morover , i can use it in other speech in future , it will help me so much . in addition , i can learn how to make plan . even i should take risk of lose something or fault . however it can improve my ability of having the vision and making olan . let u see an instance , i plan to go to some place for visite , i have been there several time ; nonetheless , i always go with tour guide and never go by myself . i make a clearful plane to decide wher to go and where to live , i need to consider how much money i will spend , and if i meet some problem how to deal with , etc. , there will a lot of situation i need to think before . i can collect information for book , internet , and others experience . if i have a good travel , than i learn how to make good plan for travel by myself . in brief , i agree that successful people come from trying new thing and take risk . because it really can improve me a lot in many place .
