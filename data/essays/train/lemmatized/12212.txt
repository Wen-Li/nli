many people are worried about the quality of the educational system at school and high school . one of the debats is if it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in my opinion it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . firstly , if you learn idea or concept you can apply them in more topic and you can understand other issue based in the same principle . on the other hand , if you learn only fact , you have a little knowledge about a few thing or question . learning idea doe not mean only that the teacher tell you something and you believe it by heart . however , it mean that with this idea , you can develop more and apply them in fact . for instance , if someone teach you the concept of the physical mouvement of car , you may transfer it to fact . you will be able to put a car in mouvement if you understood the basic principle . if someone learns only fact , this person will not be able to think by herself because her knowledge and experience is not really wide . therefore , i think that learning idea and concept may help the person to develop her mind and way of thinking . however , sometimes people can not understand the idea or concept without example , so they prefer to learn only practical thing . to summarize , in my opinion is always better to learn idea or concept than only fact because it will be more useful for the future career of student . the student will learn idea or concept about one topic but they can extend them to several field . furthermore , they will develop their skill and improve their way of thinking by themselves .
