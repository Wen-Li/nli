in some case , it is said that understanding idea and concept is very important than to learn fact . i strongly disagree with the statement for following reason : firt of all , in many time the student understands idea and concept of a subject but he or she can not apply this information to the real life . for example , in law faculty a student learn about a lot of idea or concept . he or she read many book about the law . then he or she began to think '' i read the many book and learn their concept and idea . but whenever he or she graduate the university and come across the real fact he or she realize that there are difference between teorical information and implementation . secondly , if they are in the real life it will be very easy and quickly to learn something than understand adeas and concept only . for example , before being a lawyer , in the school because they do n't join the case they amazed when they attend the case .
