although i do n't deny that some people prefer to travel with other people , i personally disagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide a per the following reason : first , i can not control my schredule and select the place to visit in the travel with a group menber by a tour guide . of course , the group type travel is the good way for someone like beginner of travel , such kind of controlled traveling is not interesting to me because i had a lot of experince with the travel not only in domestic but also in all over the world . second , in case i can travel just alone , it is possible for me to enjoy the scene and atmosphere without any disturbance by other people . however , if there is a guide or other traveling menber , i could not enjoy the travel itself under the calm circumstance . not menioned , some people ha a purpose to be friend with others by travel , but i do not need such friend in travel . third , if i join the group type travel , i have to burden some unnecessary over head cost such a fee for a guide . on the other hand , in case of traveling just by myself , i can find some kind of discout ticket and cheaper hotel like youth hostel and enjoy such kind of cost saving travel with my knowledge and planning . lastly , if i join some group type travel , i believe that i have to see some unnecessary place or monument and buy some unnecesary gift strongly recommended by the tour guide . i can not endure such kind of nuisance because what i would like to enjoy in a travel is the freedom from the daily controlled society . in this regard , i strongly hope to be free from the control or compelled recommendation during my precious time using for travel . as a conclusion , i prefer to travel alone rather than with a group menber led by a tour guide in accordane with the above-mentioned point althogh someone would like to trave with a goupmenber in term of safety purpose or easiness of the travel schedule and planning control .
