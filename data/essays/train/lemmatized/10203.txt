i agree with this statement . i also think , that understanding idea and concept is more important for student than it is to learn just fact . i can say that especially in connection to my own major mathematics and economics . for the future life it is very important , that you understood idea and concept at school and university . my first major mathematics is probably the best example for this statement . just by listening to the professor and reading book you will learn nothing about mathematics . my professor always say that we have to work on exercise ourselves because the most important thing is to understand the concept behind the think we learned . without understanding the concept , we wount be able to understand the further lecture . so it is very important , even for for little kid and school . if they do n't understand the idea in the first class , they will never understand them . another good example is my second major , economics . in the university we just look on easy topic . the goal is not to know how to work with these topic , but to understand the idea behind it to use these idea to solve more complex thing in the future life at a big company for example . that is where i come to my third very important point , why understanding idea and concept is more important than to learn fact . in the future life , especially at work , you will probably never be asked again about special fact , that you learnd at the university . if you are , it will be easy for you , to go on the internet and find out these fact . today the internet is so complex , that everyone will find almost every information he want to get . there is no need to know historical date or something like this a long a you have the ability to use a computer . so i think , these are very clear point . in my opinion , school and university should even more focus on teaching the student the idea and concept behind a topic and not make them learn fact .
