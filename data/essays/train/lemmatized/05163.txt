as time go by , lifestyle ha changed a lot back than in the 1970 's . some people believe that yong people enjoy life more than older people do . i strongly agree with this statement a following support . however , i have to say that it depends on viewer who are young people or older people . first of all , for example , my father just enjoy playing golf whenever he ha time , however , i do n't like golf because it feel like boring to me. so i usually go to sea to swim for summer and go for snowboarding for winter with my friend . i think the reason is that older people did n't have chance to have those sport which i enjoy . basically , because i am young , i can have more chance to do something which i prefer to than my father . in addition , older people usually like doing non-activity action such a reading , watching movie , seeding . however , young people usually like doing activity action such a soccer , basketball . actually , i think that these kind of theory are natural rule . my point is that between older people and young people have different thought and lifestyle . finally , many year ago , people have to work to survive without breaking . for example , my grandfather used to work outside untill he died . this effect caused by social circumstance . however , he really enjoyed his work for life . as you know , at that time many people did for their life . however , a i mentioned above , everything is changed by time . of course , if i have son , my son will enjoy life much more than me. that 's why i really agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
