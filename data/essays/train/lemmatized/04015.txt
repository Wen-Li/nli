i absolutely agree with this statement . in my point of view nowadays young people enjoy life more than older people do . this is due to the fact that life standard have changed a lot . young people have more possiblities to spend their time in several way , whereas old people do not have this possibility . moreover old people do not enjoy doing a lot of thing . whereas young people like to do sport , go to cafe and just sit there , go to club and dance and do a lot of funny thing , old people mostly get bored of those thing . i see the old peope in my environment , like my grandparent . they are sitting all the day at home and do nothing than watching tv or reading newspaper . they do n't like to talk a lot and they just want their calm , one ca n't be loud around them . they have reached all their goal in their life and have nothing special or important to do . they got a lot of time , but they do n't spend it doing nice stuff . in my experience young people just have to do something , they do n't like it to sit at home all the time and do nothing , it 's the most boring thing for young people . their life are just uncompleted , they have to make experience in every case of life . because of this they see life different than old peole do . young people want to live life , they have to reach several goal , like graduating school/university , getting a good job and having a good career . because of this they live life different . moreover the environment ha changed , young people have more possibility to do anything , like going to club and dance or different sport activity . because they 're young they want to have something like an adventure in their life , so they spend their time different , trying several thing and spending their time useful . in this case i can talk about myself . i like it to try new thing , evereyday is a new possibility for me to receive something new , to make a new experience , to learn more for my life . because old people have done most of these thing during their youngness , they do n't have a lot of field of interest . even if they have special interest , they ca n't do much stuff , being old is hard , so their body is n't strong enough for a lot of activity . old people get tired quickly and because of this they do n't like to do anything hard . they mostly even do n't know how to spend their time . in this case young people have luck , they mostly can do everything they want to and they purely enjoy it . i 'm sure when i am old i wo n't enjoy life . in my opinion being young is the best thing which can happen , because everything is than possible .
