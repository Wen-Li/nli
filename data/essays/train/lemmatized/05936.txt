advertising is a way of selling a product in the market . people see the lucrative advertisement and are tempted to buy the product but in reality most advertisement make product seem much more better then they really are . the product reliabilty should depend on it composition , use and result . firstly , an advertisement may make u believe much more then the product really is . its composition may be the same a any other product in the market which is not advertised . like we may buy cosmetic from loreal a they are very well advertised , though they may be equivalent to any other local company cosmetic . this is what advertising doe . secondly , advertising make u use the product based on assumption that the advertisement make about those product . it 's only after continuous use that we can make out whether the product is good or not . most of the brand name which are in the market now are because people find out the assumption made by the advertising company are true and many product after long term use were found to be contaminated and did not work the same way a advertised and they disappear from the market completely or for some time till they are up to the standard . example , cocacola wa banned in india because it wa found contaminated with harmful pesticide . thirdly , it the result over the period of the time that determine the reliability of the product . either scientific result or after certain time of use by the consumer the relaibilty of the product can be known . any assumption made by the advertising company is a mean to sell the product and should be considered only a market trend . therefore , one should keep in mind that advertising is the mean of selling product and what it say is not hundred percent true . its only the composition , use and the result of the use that determine the reliability of the product .
