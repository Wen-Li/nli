i am certainly agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . there are many reason to hold this opinion . here , i would like to explore some of them . first , successful people believe that opportunity lie in between the difficulty so even if they have to face lot of problem they will fight with them to get success . somebody have told that no pain no gain . if you want success you have to work hard . they know that there is no alternative for the hard work so they keep on working . they know that if i keep on trying i will get success and the moto of their life is try and try but never cry . they always remember the example of the spider which try several time to climb again . trying new thing give them confidence that will motivate them to do something different each time . second , the success that they acheive previously always motivate them to take a chance to do something new . they donot like to do the samething for their entire life . there is always fun in trying new thing and getting success . money is also one of motivating force for successful people . i heard about many businessmen who are working in different feilds . for example , relience group of industry is in many feild like petrolium , telecommunication , grocery store , steel industry and many more . not only the businessmen , actor always try new character they not always do same role . third , successful people never stop dreaming . the always want to take a chance without being worried about the result . like an old saying in my country `` if you want to be successful see dream at night and wake up in the morning and work hard to make the dream true '' . in summary , i can say that confidence , dream and hard work reward person with success and that why successful person keep on trying new thing without being worried about risk .
