when thing are going weel , doe it mean that it might turn bad ? we usually say that what go up , must go down , but is that a true statement ? when we are in a successful situation we have two possible way to react . some people will keep doing what they already do while others will try new thing and take risk . few peole who succeed will try to keep doing what they already know how to do well . that way , they will not put their life in a situation where they might loose everything . for example , somebody who learned how to fear the futur like an old entrepreneur will know when come the time to slow down an activity in order to make it safer . only very rational and experienced people will be able to take that kind of decision . you need to know yourself very well to act like that . but successful people are usually in that situation because once in their life , they took a risk , they made a decision that made them successful . most of u will get excited by success . money and honor usually turn u into non rational people . successful people will take risk and try new thing . it is true that successful people usually do n't take a step back to look at the situation . most of the time , they will take risk instead of trying to make there situation sustanable . but is that a bad thing ? life is short and we have to enjoy our lifetime . the better way to do it , is to take risk . our goal should be learning , meeting people , and discovering new thing . to conclude , there is a very important cultural part in the way people would react . from my point of view , life is short and we should always go toward new thing , that 's how we can spend an efficient time on earth . the better way to go backward is to to try to stay in the same situation .
