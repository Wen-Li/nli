nowadays the stress of traffic jam affect all the driver & people all around the world iagree with the statment in twenty year there will be fewer car in use that there are today . people will replacet with internet service first of all the internt service will be the best replacement for the car on shopping we can search on the website about all what we need for example food , clothes & book at home by making an order & pay through using credit card it will took few mintues better than using ur car & stuck in thr trafficjum for hour , then search for parking & full ur car with expensive gasolin , u will be sitting relaxed at home watching t.v while ur item u order it through the internt will arrieve secondly u can do most of ur work using the internet ordering product , markting , selling , advertsing & sending the bill to the customer . thirdly the education will be through the intenet no more student will go to school & attend classroom all student will had their class on computer , doing their homework & exam . then if u plan to visit a country u can search & read about the intersting place on the internet & buy the ticket , reserve the room in hotel while u are drinking ur cup of tea in ur bed . however we ca n't forget the advantage of the car if u plan to go to trip with ur family to eat in resturant or change the home enviroment , go for a picnic or if u want to show ur town to one of ur best friend planning to visit u because the internet able to slow down or had virus in the system which will spoil all ur programme then u need to use ur own car . finally each of the car & internet service have their advantage & disadvantage , i believe in twenty year there will be modern technolog service more that the car & internt also .
