both the case are important for an student for the student , even by learning through the fact and also by the mean of understanding the idea and concept . as the understanding the idea and concept , he can face any consequence and the problem . he can solve the problem through the idea and concept he ha . if he ha to learn by the fact then he may not think a fast a if he know the concept . he ha to learn the idea and concept because he may not face every fact in his lifetime . with the idea and concept he ha can improve his knowledge . he can apply this taughts to some new application . where he ha the chance to learn something new . idea and concept are the fact of others so the can improve his knowledge about that fact and having idea and concept of others fact will improve the student knowledge . let u take an example of newton theory , if you tell the stundent to find the law of newton he may not find on his own . because his idea will not reach suddenly to that . if he ha idea and concept about the newton theory then he can improve that theory on the other by applying it . if the student a to improve his knowledge by his own experience will lead him to become the great person in the future . but some student will come under the stress when they face the problem . but if the student ha the idea about the problem then he may solve the problem without any stress . if the student learn something by the fact , he will sutre remember it and that will become an idea and concept to others . a the every idea and concept are the fact faced by the others . every fact that student learn will become an idea to his fellowmens .
