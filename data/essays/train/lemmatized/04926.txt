people have their own idea about whether traveling alone is better than traveling by a tour guide or not . in my opinion , the best way to travel is by alone in that it can be free to tour place and easily make new firends in the new place . first , traveling alone enbles u to feel free to move on tour site . some people may think that moving new place alone is dangerous because we do not know about the place . in my opinion , however , traveling alone can benefit u to have more chance to see sight seeing . for example , if i tour with other people on scheduled , i can not see museum and church that i wante to visit exept determined site . then i do not feel satisfied with the tour . in this way , i can say that traveling along give u more chance to visit than traveling in a group . second , when it come to making new friend , moving alone greatly contributes to making it possible . it is generally agreed that traveling in a group is difficult to make new people a they have to move scheduled the sighteeing site . however , when we are free we can meet other people that may be traveling people or local resident . if they are resident , we can get more detail information on the place . it will be more helpful to take a trip alone than traveling in a group led by a tour guide . to sum up , traveling alone is better way to treveling in a group by a tour guide in that we can have more chance to visit freely favorite place and meet new friend who can give useful information about the new place . all thing considered , i can definitely say that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way a the advanteges of traveling alone mentioned aboved .
