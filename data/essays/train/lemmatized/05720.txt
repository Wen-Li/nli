have i ever been lost in foreing country ? some people may think the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide , however other might support that it is not the best way . fortuhermore it is seemed clear to me that it is most efficient and useful idea . because of having a no knowledge about the place where people plan to visit and having a good experience . the first point i would like to make about the idea , there are several advantage about visiting with tour guide in a group led . first of all i agree this statement . hence in other country which we have no idea about how the life is there . because of the criminal activity or any accident such a getting lost . being sick and not available to speak native language . consequently i had experience about visiting to other countrt which is eygpt for touristic reason . i got lost when i wa 14 year old and i couldnt speak arabic or french even english . thus i had rough time with finding my parent and guide can help and take care of u . on the other hand , i have a habit that i would like to discover everything because i believe that this is the best way of learning so because of what had happened me . i had changed my mind and i am supporting the main idea of text . because we have never gone there and the guide have been there more than u , which mean we have le information than guide . clearly i have had experience about being lost , i had changed my mind to be a person who ha a more knowlegde than i have so that i can enjoy and learn easyly . furthermore i would go next time with group led with a guide .
