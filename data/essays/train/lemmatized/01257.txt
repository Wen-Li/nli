nowadays , there are so many way to transport from one place to another . there 's the airplane , the train , the subway , the bus , the car and etc . and still , people are thinking up new idea for transportation . as more and more method for getting around are created , maybe the old method , like car , will sooner or later decrease . well , it could happen . an example of my family might a well give you a view of what i 'm trying to explain . one day , my family and i were going to go downtown . after thinking about all situation , my parent decided to take the car and my sister and i decided to try the subway that wa made recently . later on , my sister and i had to wait 30 minute until our parent arrived ! the subway wa way faster than the car and they had used 60,000 won to feed fuel to the car . they indeed regretted their decision . as you can see , science and technology ha made a big effort in inventing different way of transporting . in my region , dae-jeon , for example , recently subway have been made in order to tranport throughout the rather large city . many people are using this transportation method and are pleased with the convenience and speed compared to the bus or car . also people use the subway because it 's more cheaper . nowadays , in my country korea , the gasoline cost ha risen so high that having a car mean paying almost 15 , 0000 won per month . not to mention the other cost that you need to pay while maintaining a car . therefore about twenty year later there will be fewer car in use than there are these day . as the era develops rapidly , people prefer the faster and more convenient method . and car do n't fit with these factor that well .
