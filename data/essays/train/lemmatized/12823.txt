it is better to have a broad knowledge of many acadenic subject our day . i think that because today , no matter what you do you never know for how long you will still be doing to do that . everything can change in just a month today . if you look back 100 year ago , think were differnent , people only learned one job and kept on doing that job for their whole life . back than people mostly even passed on that job to their kid but today it is a lot different . people are not that much devided into class anymore which give everyone an oppertunity to do what they want . of course it is harder for a person who grows up in a bad neighberhood to become a let say a proffesor but society and the law would allow him to do so . i am writing this from a western european point of view , i guess there are country that might not have this freedom jet . in europe or in any developed country the competion for a working place is increasing , that is why i think it can only be helpful to know a much a possible , to be able to compete with others that are capable of doing the same work . in country like france or germany it is getting really important to be well educated because if one is not educated it can happen that he would have a hard time getting a job because since the border are opened , european union worker can come from every where and work for le money . for myself it is important to catch a much knowledge a i could possibly get . that is also one of the reason why i am sitting here writing this essay . i guess people could argue that if one know something very well he will always find a job but unfortunetly there is no safe job anymore . i just resently red that even jurnalism is not a safe job anymore because of all the internet page where everyone can submit his experience .
