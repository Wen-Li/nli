i think that it is more important for student to learn fact than it is for them to undestand idea and concept . my choice is based on two reason . the first reason is that , if you learns fact , you have a direct contact with the reality . for example , in the university , you can learn more skill if you follow a laboratory than you follow a lesson of theory . this is a good way not only for a student , but also for a worker . in fact , if a worker ha worked all of the day , he or she learn more thing than he or she follows a lesson of theory . i know my uncle 's experience that can be taken a an example . in fact , he ha followed a course to work in a chemistry industry , but he ha learn the real way of working only when he ha started to work in the chemistry industry . the second reason is that learning fact help a student to understand in a better way the contest in which he or she is studying . for example , i remember that , when i follow the course in the `` way of transport '' , the professor helped me to build a naval motor not spoken me of how a naval motor is composed but he did to see me the naval motor and we built togheter . to conclude , i do n't agree with the sentence because it is not true that is more important for student to understand idea and concept than for them to learn fact .
