i would have to say that the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide but with more immediate friend and contact . although , if one wa planning a trip to go to a foreign country that is famous for it 's site , it would n't be a bad idea . traveling with people most likely from the same country with a guide that speaks your native language would perhaps provide a comfort and ease away the shyness some tend to have when leaving their comfort zone . but i do n't think that would be enough . my purpose to travel would be able to experience and understand the different and not just to be able to say `` i 've been there . '' if you only wanted to learn about a certain place , you could just buy a book or even go online and use the internet a a source to see picture and obtain information . you 'll be able to know how big it is , why it 's called that and everything a tour guide could tell you just by reading . and i 'd have to say blatantly that that would seem a little boring , listening to a lecture on vacation . another , culture is a very important element . with a tour guide , they 'd be able to introduce you to important restaurant and store marketed for tourist that sell souvenir . with a little bit of research you could enjoy and plan all this yourself . so , i would prefer traveling with friend and/or family . if not , then alone . hopefully then , i will be able to make new friend there and also have the opportunity to hear the story from them , which is an experience that would be difficult to achieve in a pre-designed course .
