some people agree that we should broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject and other people believe that it is better to have deep knowledge in one specific subject rather to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . both of these point of view have advantage and disadvantage . to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is very important in our social life , on the one hand it would let the person to participate in conversation where ever he is and with whom is talking , on the other hand it will let him understand what he read about those subject in newspaper and what he hear about them in news . the disadvantage of this is that he know only some idea and ca n't go in deep when talking about a specific subject . to have a deep knowledge only in one specific subject rather than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject have advantage that the person is very understanding what is going on in the detail of this subject and that can let him to do research in this field and maybe to help the society if something come up with him . the negative aspect of this statement is that the person doe not know what is happening in other field and do n't have a good culture which is required in our dayly life . although , both of these statement have advantage and disadvantage , i do strongly agree that a person should join between these two statement and not only try to specialize in one specific subject but also to have broad knowledge in other academic subject .
