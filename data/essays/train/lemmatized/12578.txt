now adays most of the people are trying new thing without taking risk , in my opinion it 's a wrong thing , 1st of all when we are going to try something new we should ask about it , specially we should ask the pirson who tried this thing , 2nd the successful people try new thing and take risk , i want to tell something from my own experience , i have a cousin & he want to buy a new car and i warned him ' i told him this car is not good it 's spending petrol & it 's not fast car also it 's expensive car , he told that i do n't believe you & i will buy this car , i told him it 's up to you , after one month he came for me & he told you that i wa right when i told him not to buy that car , also that i have i friend & he want to marrie one girl in the university i told him that i know this girl & she 's always preparing date with a other men , he told me that you are jaleous , i told him ok do what ever you want , after 6 month he came & told you are right , i heared her voice talking with another guy & i wa shocked , so i think we should ask the people who have experience before we try anything new , it 's better for u , from now on we should learn to ask the people about something we want to try it i think it 's not a shame to ask question , i ve got a lesson from my cousin & my friend , that 's u should't try new thing before asking the old person or the person who have an experience
