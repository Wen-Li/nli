youth are the back bone of any nation . the development of nation is in their hand . so they do lot of thing which include helping to community . as being of the same group i would like to disagree with the statement . youth have a lot of reponsibilities in building strong nation . though they are involved in their restless work they do spend some time for the benefit of others . the strong reason for my disagreement is they help the community with their profession also . they are hell lot of young enterpreneurs who are looking forward to help the society by providing employment . i would like to mention the charitable organisation being established by various mnc 's where lot of youth work for it . they concentrate on various basic eminities like drinking water , laying road , conducting awareness camp , oldage home . all these organisation are run by the youth in a fantastic way . though they do not directly involve inthe action the are the back bone of various organisation . i would like to notify this example from my personal life , during our college day we used to dedicate 2 saturday of every month to plant tree in various community beside our college and we were awareded for that and taking that spirit we are still continuing . the work done by youth do not attract mass medium or other mean a they feel it a a duty rather than reponsibility . the awareness camp conduted by youth against aids ha been a exellent program in the history of our country . helping to others need not require any organisation and work under it it can be a small help that you contribuited for others welfare and especially for the needy . in a nut shell , i state the being considering a a duty youth are playing a key role in improving the standard of the society by contributing quality of work without exposing to medium beinga reason to supress our effort .
