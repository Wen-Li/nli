i agree with this statement that young people do not spend enough time to help their community based on my experience . first of all , for a period of time , educaters or parent do not give enough ecouragement to young people of the importance of contributing to communites . for example , high school or junior high school student are only pressured by school work such a homework . therefore , they do not have an opportunity to learn the importance of giving others like doing a volunteer work for the poor or old citizen in our society . this phenomenon continues when they grow up and become a university student . during this period , they are apt to feel much pressure caused by their future career . this concern result in that student become selfish and only pursue their own interest for their sake . they learn only how to compete each other and seek for the method how they can be successful a soon a possible . they do not have chance to think about what they gain from community they are living . furthermore , there is another serious problem that cause this phenomenon . for a decade , there are increasing number of people who go abroad to study or immigrate to a foreingn country . it mean that the community is threatend by decreasing number of people who would forget to contribute to their society . lastly , there are a diversity of entertaining activity that would attract young people . there exist a ton of movie theater , shopping mall , restaurant and bar for young people to enjoy and spend their time . they are just hectic to spend their free time in enjoying their hobby with friend with various fun activity . who would want to do a volunteer work for other people or be concous of how their community is going in their busy life ? these three reason make me think that young people are not contributing to their society enough and appreciating their community .
