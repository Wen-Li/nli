when people go to travel , some people llike to travel with their own plan while others prefers to travel with a tour guide . a trip with tour guide provide a convenient journey in that they provide much information about the place and planned sechedule , however , i do not think the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide . in my opinion , to travle with our own plan is more exciting experience because i can go to the place where i can want to go and i can enjoy a trip with my friend . if i plan my trip schedule , i can go anywhere i really want to go . in case of traveling with a group led a tour guide , i should go to the place where i really want to go , however , if i am placed in the center in my travel , i do not need to waste time to look and work around which i do not interested in . with my flexible schedule i can enjoy more my trip . moreover , scheduleing my travel plan is quite exciting and from doing that , i can get some useful information about the traveling place . in addition , in case of traveling with a group by a tour guide , i should get along with other people participated in the trip . however , i do not really want to enjoy with them and there are some people who are interfere the trip with their own convenience . i never want to be interfered with those situation because i really wish to enjoy my trip and also have a opportunity of takeing some break from hard work in school , stressing out , and refreshing my self . to travel is a exciting and so memorable experience . since i do not be involved in such situation which i really want to and i hole to enjoy my trip fully , i prefer traveling with my own planning .
