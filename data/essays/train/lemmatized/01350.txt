in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i extremely agree with because of following two specific reason . first . using the car might be decrease because of economic problem . if you want drive , you can recognize that your car want fuel . becase of many reason , oil price is getting expensie . i think there are not many people to afford such a high price for driving . secondly , people who live in a big city do not have enough time for exercise . i can see many warning copy and ad . most of doctor suggest that people have to exercise more than they think . my university noticed that use a bycicles rather than car or motorcycle . school doctor also said to me that do more exercise . many people will join this campaign , and so many people use their bycicles instead of car . i 'm sure that this movement is not only processing in my country . in conclusion , i 'm sure that there are many beneficial aspect by using car . but i strongly argue that in twenty year will be fewer car than today because of economic and personal reason a i said .
