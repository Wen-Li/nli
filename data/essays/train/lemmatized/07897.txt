i agree to the statement that young people nowadays do not care much about their community . the change of how people think is the major reason for this problem . first of all , many youngster nowadays spend much of their time doing their own thing , therefore they do not have time to think about their surroundings . for example , many young people want money , so they spend a lot of time on doing job . so , they leave home early , and they come back home late . moreover , young people today are becoming extremely lazy . they would rather do something which they can be satisfied in the short-term , rather than the long-term . there are many home today with television and computer , so young people stay in their home reffering to watch television than help their community . these new technology keep the young people in their home . finally , the new generation of people are selfish . they would not volunteer to do anything if they do not recieve something . even at school , a child would not help teacher move book unless they get a candy . a young teenager would not do chore if he doe not get an allowance . overall , young men and woman today must be satisfied with themselves before thinking of others . it will take a fortune to be satisfied with oneself , so eventually , young people will end up doing nothing to help their community .
