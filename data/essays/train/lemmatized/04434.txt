travel in group is the best way to travel , because you know new people and you can make new friend in all the travel , and the travel can be better if you have a tour guide taht can explain alll the part of the place that you are going to visit . when you are in group you file like you are in home and all the group take care of all , the guide is lake the mom who teach the grupo all the place that they want to know , and to explain who make some building o when the construccion of one building started thing that you really apreciate in a travel . when you travel whit your family i thing that is boring that traveling whith your friend , because when you are whut your family they always go to know museum or think that you really do not wat to see , but when you go wuit your friens and you have a funny tour guide that is a unforgetable experiency , because you file like nobody is going to tell you wath to do or at what time you need to come back to the group . when you travel alone i thing that you get bored so easy and you do not enjoy the travel , you only saw the buiding whitout now who wa maked or when wa maked i do not now thing that really apreciate when you travel , but i thing that the convivence whit other person is more nice that going alone whit nobody who make you smile or enjoy more the travel . traveling whit a group led by a tour guide is the best travel that you can have , no matter the place that you can go or the person that come with you , is more interesting . i only say for the people who like to travel alone that are losing your time in a trip .
