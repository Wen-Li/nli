do you have driver 's license ? recently , a lot of people get driver 's license in japan , especially student . threfore , i think more car will be sold because more people will get driver 's license and higt technology is innovatede . many people tend to think that car are very convienient to move , so they get to driver 's licence . for example , almost all my friend have driver 's license and when we travel , we always move by car . we like listen music in a car . in addition , we think car are convinient because we can go anywhere by only car . if we take train , we often should walk to our destination . some friend have their own car and the rest of them work hard to buy car . therefore , car are needed by many people . many caompanies of car make many car to show their high technology . i major in machanical engineering in my university . someday , i went to plant of toyota and nissan to study making car . the engineer in both toyota and nissan make an effort to create new car . they want to improve the speed and confortable structure of car , and they are caring of the environment . so , a number of new model car are showed . alhough i know we have some problem of car such a accident of car and destroying the environment , i think we ca n't get rid of our current life .
