as to the option that wether to travel in a group led by a tour guide , many people believe that a single tour will be better because there are more freedom during the tour . i am , however , most likely among the one who think that there are far more advangtages to travel in a group with a tour guide . the reason are a follows . the most obvious reason is that we can make more friend in a group . take myself a an example . once i visited beijing in a group , i made a lot of frirends . we are still keep in contact now and have already decided several trip after that and really enjoyed the time we spared togather . it is undoubt that taking a trip with friend make the trip happier and of greater valueble . further more , it is better to have a guide with u during the trip so that we can know the background of the place . if i visit a new place , i would like to know the culture of the place , how the peolpe live , what is the famous feature of the place , what ha happend in the past on this land . .. all of these seem attract me a lot . therefore , a guide who can describe all the thing above is extremely necessoy . finally , the disadvantage of a single trip is indisputable . for a stranger to a totally new place , it always to take a long time to get familiar with the site . it is a waste of time a well a a watst of money for a traveler to stay in a place just lingering to find where to go . in addition the instance of a single traveler getting lost can be found anywhere . from what ha been discussed above , we can safely draw a conclution that traveling in a group led by a guide is far better than a individul trip .
