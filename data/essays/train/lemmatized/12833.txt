in japan , some people think that young people give enough time to helping their community recently . however , i agee with the idea that young people do not do that for the folloing reason . first , young people nowadays have seldom opportunity to help their community . for example , when i wa a student of secondary school in 1990 , i lived in nagoya , which is the fourth largest city in japan . in nagoya , there were some rule in my communiy that people had to gather once a month , and had to pick up trushes on the road near our community . young person and child also required to attend the activity . it take about two hour at one time , but i could contribute to the community . but now , there are no activity like that in my community and i hardly hear the existence of such an activity from my friend . this example demontrates that i strongly believe that there are not enough opportunity for young people to help their community . second , young people nowadays have little sense to belong to their community . for instance , when i lived in nagoya , the neighboors were so kind that there were many opportunity to meet them . i thought that the neighboors were close to me , and that the community wa important for me . i always wanted to help my own community because i felt belonging to the community . but now , the neighboors become more far away because people like to spend time more with their friend rather than with their neighboors . in addition , a sense of privacy increased now , people tend to keep a distance from their neighboors . this example clearly show that young people nowadays have little sense to belong to their community . therefore , i definitely agree with the idea that young people do not give enough time to helping their community recently .
