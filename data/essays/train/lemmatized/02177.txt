everyone life in a communty that consists of people , in which , all the people , old and young , are supposed to join the community activity , and to help their community in many of aspect . however , nowadays , it is argued that young people do not contribute to their community than in old day i agree with this opinion , since i believe the young people do not have enough time , do not have enough chance to communicate with others in the community , and also lack of the good motivation to help their comunity . first , the young people now experience more presssure in their job and study than before , they have to work very hard to compete their peer , which make them really lack of time to have other activity insteading of working or studying . they spend all the time in the classroom or office . and even when they go home at night , they will be so tired that can only go sleep at home instead of going outside to help their community . the other reason is that , nowadays the community in human society seem have le chance for the people , especially for the young people , to communicate with each other . for some stupid reaons , such a security , all the building in the city are built like prison . all the door are locked so firmly that even the mouse could n't get in . the people living in these `` prison '' are usally not familiar with their neighbor even their are living in the next door . this make the young people do not consider their community a their own , and thus might not show up publicly so ofte . that 's why they do n't even have the chnace to help their community . finally , the people of all society , including the young people of course , become le and le motivated to help their community . as the economic development of our society , the people more and more focus on money a the value of the life , while disregard the good reputation they might earn from the society . usualy the young people will obtain nothing except some apreciation form their community if they do contribute to it . this make them feel valueless to help the community , and thus spend le and le time to take part in the community activity . to summerize , the young people indeed contribute le time to help their comunities , and i think it 's the problem of our cultrure nowadays , which actually encourage the people disregard their community , and do not allow the people have enough time to paticipate the activites of their community . i think it would be better for our future , if the young people can do more for their coummnities .
