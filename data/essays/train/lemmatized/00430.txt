in my opinion young people enjoy life more than old people do for many reason . a young person can do a lot of thing because he is physically halthy , can do a lot that old 's can not do and because he is young and no one will look at what is he donig . a lot of people think that old people are enjoy the life more than young because they think they have experiance in life . they think that this experiance will make them happy because they no what to do to be a happy person . this may not be a good idea because even if old people have an experiance they will not be able to use this experiance . they become old and harmfull . they will not be able to do every thing . as a young person i can do a lot of thing . there are many hapits to do in the daily life . a young person can go running , play football , drive a race care and play a young people new electronic game . this will be hard to old person to do or it may be do n't fit to an old person to do like electronic game . for most young people they like to do hard or dangeruce activity . driving a race car in a real race can be very dangeruce for an old person he may get a hard attack . other thing that is young people can make a plannes for the fucure , they have the time that old do n't have . finally , a young person can enjoy life more than old can do . he have the ability , the advantege and the time . for all old people they must have taken a young period and enjoy it . so that it is time for the new generation .
