i can say i do agree with the statement because the whole industry of advertising ha been constructed on the use of psychological trick that can work to perasuade average people , or more likely some target of people , to buy a certain product . the characteristic described in tv advertising have often been exagerated because people have to be impressed in first place to remember the name of a product , recognize it in the shop and then buy it . fact is , that people can effectively realize how good a product is only once they have tried it , but this way the aim of the advertising campaign ha already been reached . now , what are the strategy people can develop to defend themselves from this sort of manipulation ? first , they can try to get suggestion from people they know and trust , such a relative of friend , about a specific product they are willing to buy . second , they can take advantage of the large number of offer dealer make when they have to launch a new product on the market : this way they can try something new without spending too much money on it . third , people can always count on some association , which have been specifically created to defend customer from manipulation of company ' advertising . these are often no profit organization which are giving to give suggestion and assistance when people need it , making sure that the clause `` satisfied or refunded '' is respected . in conclusion i would like to recommend people to always think twice before buying something which look too good , because , a far a everybody know , good brand never need advertising simply because their name is always on everyone 's mouth .
