this question reminds me of the time i chose my way when i wa a high school student . i definitely agree with the statemant that having broad knowledge is better than specializing in one specific subject because of three reason . first , it provides u with a broad and comprihensive point of view . in reality , there are many problem that can not be solved by one point view . for example , you can refer to the environmental problem or poverty and so on . the environmental problem are related to chemistry , economics , or politics . poverty is also connected with many point of view such a sociology , economics , agriculture and so on . there is no problrems that can be solved with only one point of view . you have to integrate you broad knowledge to find the solution . second , it can give the student choice which field they want to study and have career . it is stupid to force student to choose their field without knowing many subject and which field suit them . especially in japan , student must choose their discipline before they enter the university . therefore , i wa frustrated to do it , and chose my current program of my university which allows you to study whatever you want while you are a undergraduate student . so i really appreciate this program . like this program , studying many thing can give student a chance to choose . lastly , it brings you a lot of fun to studying many thing . people naturally have curiosity to know many thing and it should not be stopped . when i learn something new , i feel really happy and want to know more . for these reason , i believe that to study many academic subject than to specialize in one secific subject .
