i agree with the statement above because i think that humanity in general ha beneficiated from men willing to risk what they previously achieved in order to find something new or more valuable . if some scientist would n't have put under scrutiny the discovery of the past we probably would n't have increased our knowledge in medicine or science in general . when galileo galilei said that our planet hearth wa round and not flat like everyone else wa thinking had everything tho lose and in fact he had to retreat his affirmation in order to save his life from the accusition of heresy . if we would n't have question our knowledge we probably would n't have discovered all those thing that we are taking now for granted . even those thing will probably came under scrutiny in a not long future giving u the chance to improve what we know or we think of knowing . the ability of putting ourself under judgment and been up for new challenge is a great gift . it 's never too late to learn something new and ampliate our knowledge . that it will only give u more a a person . we should never lose our curiosity of when we were child , our brain will never stop to learn if pushed in doing so . there is nothing wrong with failure a long a we are going to learn from our mistake and put them into use for a successful purpose . that 's why
