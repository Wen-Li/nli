some people claim that sucsesfull people are only working hard , while others like me fully agree that success dependts on trying and searching . the first point i would like to make is that there are strong advantage to work in a same way . one benefit of working in the same way is not becoming any risk . you wo n't fall down . for instance , my father who is a mechanical mechanical engineur . he worked 30 year for one company so became enough money and promitions . he started a a basic engineur and he became his promotion with his hard work . he had n't got any stress because the company doe n't care him he care only his work . undoubtedly , not taking risk mean a healty , relax and safety life . though there are strong advantage to working in a same way there are some even more compelling advatages for me to work with risk . when you take risk the income will be more . for example , i 'm a mechanical engineur like my father but i want to have my own company so i can take more risk for making my company bigger . this risk will be enjoyable too because i like this style of life . more than that , i can learn a lot of thing with my risk . the income will be always bigger with risk . in addition , without risk a person could n't be enough creative . with the help of the stress our body ha got more adrenalin which mean more creativity and better work . this is a biological truth and would make u successful . in conclusion , i fully advocate to taking risk will make someone more successful . everyone can work hard on a same thing but successfulness depends on creativity which is the result of risk .
