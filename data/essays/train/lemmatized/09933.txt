i completely agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . in today 's fast and constantly changing world , with globalization taking place at a furious pace , a person should be a jack of all trade to excel in life . it is better to have a broad knowledge and know all the aspect involved than just to limit the scope . take for example an industrial engineering graduate . industrial engineering being a generalized branch , the student ha got a broad knowledge of all the industry be it manufacturing , software , healthcare , finance . after graduating from the college he can fit into any type of industry . getting a job is not a problem for him because he ha got a variety of option to choose from . even if he want to set up his own manufacturing firm , he ha the knowledge of finance and manufacturing . he can put to use his knowledge and work effectively . he will not have to rely on people from other field for advice . he can be his own bos . specialization limit the scope of individual . it restricts him . it make learning monotonous . after an individual is done with his study , it also becomes difficult for him to find a job , which suit his requirement and interest appropriately . specialization also take a lot of brooding of the subject matter . it may be that the subject matter in which an individual is interested to specialize , may not be good from the point of view of market . he may not get good return . after investing in a lot of hardwork , one expects good return and satisfaction to come his way . this may not be the case if an individual specializes in one specific subject . thus having a broad knowledge of many subject help a person to have a broader view about the aspect involved in any industry or any event taking place . his scope is not confined . he ha the ability to take a decision from the plethora of knowledge he ha gained from the many academic subject he ha studied . thus generalization is always better for the prospect of an individual .
