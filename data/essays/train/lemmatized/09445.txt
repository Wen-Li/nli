fewer car , better life in the past century , we witnessed many dramatic change . the broad use of internet , the faster service of communication , and of course , the great change of transportation mean . though car may be one of the most beneficial invention in the last century , i still believe that in the following twenty year , it use will reduce . the greatest concern of all car owner may be the oil price . during the past decade , thousand of people suffered from the rapid growth of oil price . it may cost you a lot to by a porshe , and may cost you much more to afford the energy it need . i read in newspaper that more and more people transfered to use public transportation mean rather than drive their car to avoid this big expense . some chose car-pool instead . let 's focus on our environment , say , the quality of the air . a lot of country made new policy to deal with the air pollution caused by the use of car . the implementation of these rule and regulation will promote the environmental protection , and because of this , those car owner whose car may be not qulified according to these rule , may decide not to drive it any longer . thus fewer car may be in use in the future . last but not least , almost everyone ha the experience of being caught in a trafic jam . this inconvenience may not only cause u to angry but also cause many other problem . what could you do if you need to do an important presentation to your bos but got yourself in the flood of car ? or maybe you were late for a decisive negotiation because of the bad traffic ? i think this may be the reason for those multinational corperations to restrict their employee to drive their private car . efficiency is everything . admittedly , car have brought u many precious thing . but we are enjoy le and le right now due to the excessive use of car . i think and wish that we could enjoy a better life and be le dependent on car .
