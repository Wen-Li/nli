i really enjoy travelling . in my life , i would like to visit the most country in this world . however , what is the best way to travel ? i have experienced travel in a group led by a tour guide . also , i have traveled in a group without tour guide . so , i can say that i do agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i will talk about both way of travelling . when i graduated in high school , some student and i planed a trip to paris . we choose to travel with a tour guide when we arrived in paris . this is the best trip i have ever taken . the trip guide know almost any kind of entertainment in paris , with him , we discovered paris and his surrounding . he brought u to visit the effel tower , the champs elysee . second , the tour guide brought u to a small city surrounding paris , and we enjoy the nature , the architecture of this part of the city . the advantage of travel with a tour guide is that he know the map of the city , therefore , he ha no difficulty to guide u . however , the most significant disadvantage to travel with a tour guide is that it require additional money . i also travel with some friend without tour guide . we decided to visit the city of quebec . it wa really difficult for u to read a map and visit the city because it wa our first time to travel in this town . we did n't enjoy the trip a we did when we were in paris . must of the time we were in quebec , we frequently ask direction to people around the street . some of these people were willing to help u , but other were to busy to take a time to guide u . fortunately , it wa cheaper to travel without a tour guide . to conclude , there are several advantage to travel in a group led by a tour guide because this person pocess knowledge related to tourism . however , a i enjoy travelling , travel in group without a tour guide can be great especially when i do n't have enough money to pay for a tour guide .
