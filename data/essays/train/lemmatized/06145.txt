whether to travel by forming a group or individually ha been controversial among many people . however , i basically disagree with the position that it is a best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide . i have two reason for my claim . it prevents people to enjoy their personal privacy and enables them to visit only limited place . most of all , people are hardly like to enjoy their privacy once they had a trip by joining a group . as a matter of fact , participating a package travelling need oeople to organize altogether and always neccessary to have a cooperation with the stranger . besides , people are even required to eat their meal at same place and a same time . thus , there is no private time available to enjoying themselves such a walking on the beach and having some relax when they wish to . as a result , traveling in a group can make people feel frustrated and quite dissappointed . in addition , it is hard to travel around some place where they want to . generally , the trip 's schedule ha already planned by a tour guide which make it difficult for people to visit their own desirable place where they always dreamt about . in contrast , by travelling around some country alone , will allow people walking around place and take some photograph and enjoy thier holiday . accordingly , going on a trip individually will be beneficial for people to ace diverse place . to sum up , everyone ha different opinion on this issue . however , i strongly oppose the perspective that travelling a a group is better . this is because it provides lack of time to have private time and only few place are able to visit .
