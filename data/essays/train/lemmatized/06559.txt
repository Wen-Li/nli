different way thinking schools and university have different way in teaching their student . we have thousand of school all over the world , and they have different way in teaching . we have a problem which is that their are two way inorder for a student to study . either he understands idea and concept or he just learn fact a it . learning fact is the study in which a student just learns the fact a it is without knowing the origin of it . i think that this isnt a goodway . long ago we have theory done by scientist from different country . every scientist doe hie experiment and come out with a hypothesis and considers it a theory . in our present life some people just learn these fact without understanding it . we have many problem and wrong issue that people come out with and we cant just trust it and move according to it . we should study the origin of these theory and try to prove it wrong . according to u fact is something that is found a it is and we should all work with it . on the otherhand , we have the way of understanding idea which i think that it is much better than learning fact . a student should not just know this or that idea , he must understand it well in order to use it . for example in my native school which is said to be one of the best school in lebanon , follows the first way of teaching which is understanding idea . understanding idea is a way that help the person brain to be more opened and refreshes his mind . according to my opinion , i think that we must understand idea first in a good manner . we should not learn fact a they are but try to understand from where did this fact come from and study it well .
