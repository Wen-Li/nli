advertisements will do anything to grab your attention . whether it be a commercial on television , a page in the magazine , or a billboard . make up , food , clothing , or any other product that seems appealing to people these day , are always advertised much better than they truly are . it 's always exciting for woman to see the gorgeous eyelash in the magazine from a certain mascara . it look long and thick in the magazine , but once you buy it , it look nothing like what you saw . being angry and throwing the mascara away wo n't help . that 's just the way advertisement are . they are made to attract people and made for people to buy what they are trying to advertise . or else , what 's the point ? why would an advertisement be about something to make people sick to the stomach ? ( unless it wa about not doing drug and showing a picture of what it could do to you . ) i remember when i wa in second grade and i wa walking through a store and i came upon this barbie convertible . the box had a picture with barbie and ken in it , and i thought wow how great ! a convertible with ken and barbie in it for only 20 dollar ? ! however , when i got home and opened it , i realized that it wa only the convertible . little did i know , the advertisement on the box had in tiny word `` barbie and ken not included . '' even if it ha the word in tiny letter on the side , the advertisement is still tricking you and having your mind not even think twice about reading the box or paying attention and just buying it . if the picture on the box only had a convertible , it would look dull and unappealing to most , and therefore they would n't earn any money . the commercial industry always ha to make a product look better than it really is . even when it come to pen , they have to make it look like the coolest pen in the world . the smallest product in the world are advertised to look better than they really are , and it 's all for business , and money .
