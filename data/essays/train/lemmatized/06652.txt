my point of view about this topic is clear and precise : i totally disagree with this statement . i am going to explain the reason why i think young people generally give enough time to helping their community . the best example i could explain is about myself . in fact , i am engaged in an association a a volunteer , the name of the association is worldwide known a `` emaeus '' . the goal of this association is to provide help to poor people by providing to them the food they need , or in winter by collecting used clothes from generous family and give it to the poorest . here are two of the possibility by witch you can work a a volunteer , but there are several others issue . my best friend for example graduated his business school on last year , so he ha a diploma in finance and accounting major . thanks to those knowledge he ha about accounting , he engaged himself for working 5 hour per week a account manager for the association emaeus , and a a volunteer of course . my friend and i do that because we want to fell usefull , and this provides a good personal satisfaction to help the one who are in need . the second reason why i disagree whith that statement is because in the country i live in ( france ) , this enjoyement for helping community is becoming more and more common . in school or university for example , we could find lot of advertizing for becoming engaged in association , and this have more response that attepted . people in france are very quiet about helping their commuunities .
