yes , it is . they can not learn fact without understanding idea and concept . i t 's the logical order . because , fact will be modified and depend to the concept . for exemple , in science , physically scientist ca n't do a new investigation if they do n't know the rule , of the fonction , of human body . when they get the necessary theory , they can establish a hypothese and bring a proximative conclusion that they expected . it 's like a we see the examination treated with mouthes . if they seek a new drug for certain sickness , before testing inventing drug directly on the humain body , they will test on another animal , like mouthes . and before the execution , they need to study on the natural function and caracteristics of this animal , comparing with it of humain being and on the base of that , they intend to do pas to the next step for gain the best conclisions that they expect . if you change the order they can not noticifie of their failors , if they fail , or in the same time , they canot be sure that they will get the this conclusion in which way and for what cause . for exemple , imagin that they invented a drug for the cancer , they test it on a suffer . the cancer stopped to spread in his body . why ?
