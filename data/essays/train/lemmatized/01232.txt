it is really good to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , but specializing is something that is probably more useful once a person start working . this doe n't mean that a wide knowledge of many academic subject is n't an advantage for those who have it . when a person end his high school or university study , he find out that employer of many company look for people with specific ability . for istance it is not very common for a person who graduated in geography to work for an investiment bank because he probably doe n't know enough about the financial market and doe n't have a many quantitative tool a a mathematician or a a person who graduated in economics . of course no economic graduate will easily find a job a a geography resercher . in these specific case , which are certainly not the only , it is probably better to be specialized in a single subject . however , it is not very hard to understand that , between those who specialized in just one specific subject , not everyone will be able to have a succesful career . when a company choses a person to advance in his position , it doe n't look only at working ability ( which are supposed to be pretty good for everyone ) , but it also look for leadership ability . i think that a person that ha broad knowledge of many academic subject will be most likely to have this characteristic : thanks to the many thing he know , he can speak with many different people from the many different area of the company which he work for . this comunication ability will make it easier for him to be a leader inside the company . in conclusion , i do n't really agrre to the topic statement because i would n't be able to chose between broad knowledge of many academic subject and specialized knowledge : i would spend more time studying , so that i could have both .
