advertisements is a big part of the product in the manufacturing world . many people will say that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . others will say that advertisement do n't make product seem much better than they really are . personally , i agree to this statement , that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for example , during the exciting day of the super bowl . many company fight over for a commercial spot for their product , which is usually alcohol beverage . these company make these the most funniest , interesting , and catchy phrase for everyone to watch . eventhough they are just regular everyday alcohol product . if the prospector see the advertisement , many people will might get convinced to buy the product because they just make it better when you watch it with everyone during the super bowl . a second example is advertisement for facial product , like make-up . many woman would want to have a efficient product of make-up for their face . the advertisement have picture and small movie clip , showing how effective their manufacture are by expressing that they are the best , than other advertisement . another example is in a personal experience when there wa a modeling contest in japan . the production made advertisement that convinced people to join the contest because they offered many opportunity to the girl ; like money , magazine , and to be in a movie . these are some of the girl dream , because of the advertisement for this contest more than 100,000 girl from the age of tweelve to eighteen registered for this contest . advertisements are now a big part of the product , in the manufacturing world , because many people are convinced visually . consequently , these are the reason why i support the statement that most advertisement amke product seem much better than they really are .
