learning and having knowledge are to different thing . learning mainly related to theritical knowledge or we can say , that it mean lerning fact . understanding an idea and concept is not learing , but in my opinion i think that understanding fact and concept is more better than the learning fact . a fact and concept will help me to implenment the idea in more promising way than the learning fact . for example when i wa in my ninth standard i got my exibition , project on solar cooker and in that project i secured a+ and when the same question came on solar cooker wa asked on my annual exam i secures only b+. although i wa having good knoweledge of solar cooker but i better implemented it through using the idea and conceopts in the project . and in my opinion in life only the idea and concept which you have in mind help and not the fact which you have learned . it will only provide you with good grade in class . and to improve your progress report for getting success a person is asked to implement it idea so to show that he is far more better than his other collegues . although in intial stage of life you have to use your acedemic record but they do n't help you for a long run success for long run success you have to perform by your idea and concept . idea are store in mind for pemanent way but lerning fact remian only till exam . so in my opinion understanding idea is more important then learning fact
