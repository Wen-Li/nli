i do believe that the young people enjoy life more than older people do because the young people have more time and energy to enjoy in a day a compared to the older people who work throughout the day mostly to make end meet and hence are left with not much of a time and energy to enjoy at the end of the day . being young you have lot of thing to explore and look at a in school and then the college . all those different field trip and the social and cultural program are just a few to mention when we say about how the young people enjoy more than the older people . for the older people , their job or business do not have such field trip or cultural program to lighten up their spirit , a their schedule doe not permit with all such thing . a typical 9 to 5 job to take up the time of the day doing pretty much the same job for year together . the older generation pay for the enjoyment of the younger generation . and literally , it is so , a the older people spent most of their life making and building their asset , which is of course for the younger generation of theirs . so the young people spend on their parent money and do not have to worry about how they will get the money tommorow a they know they have a monthly or the daily allowance which is going to come their way anyways . as the older generation have more worry in thinking about their finance and budget and their house hold requirement which the younger generation doe not have to think of a it is been taken care of for them by the older people . so that again leaf them more time and energy to enjoy . so i feel that young people surely do enjoy more than the older people do .
