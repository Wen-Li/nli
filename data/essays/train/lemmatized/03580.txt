although student are very different from each other - so what is true and valid for one may not be true and valid for an another - i generally agree with the statement , but i think one element can not be separated from the other : this mean that there are no idea and concept without fact , and there are no fact without idea and concept . from my point of view fact are not so important if you don ' t have the instrument for analysing them , and the instrument are given by idea and concept : understanding the `` abstract '' idea give student the tool for facing reality and learning fact , otherwise they would not get anything of what they are reading , for example on history book , which are the place where you can mostly find `` fact '' . history is to me the best example of this mutual relationship between concept and fact because it is made of fact , but the study of history can not exist without idea and concept . i can mention my personal case : when i wa a student i really enjoyed studying history , but when i grew up i realized this wa because i consider history more a a collection of interesting and pictoresque event than a real action done by people who have lived before me , and whose action ha had an effect on our present ( latins used to say `` historia magistra vitae '' ) ; this mean at the time i missed the connection , i did n't apply those marvellous story to the present , in other word i did not understand idea and concept . now that i am more mature i see thing from a different perspective , and i try to approach fact always keeping in my mind some general principle . thisis why i think student in school , even if very young , should try to do the same , of course with the help and assistance of their teacher .
