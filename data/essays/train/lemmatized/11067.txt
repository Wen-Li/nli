there will be quite fewer car in use twenty year later surely . nowadays , there are trend not having any car , encouraging the use of public transportation , and the attempt to invent more effective transportation . it is due to many contemporary car problem : serious traffic jamming , environment pollution and lacking of oil . first of all , one of the reason i expect fewer car in the future is that the traffic jam on our road is incredibly severe now . in some country like korea , the land are very densely populated , there are excessive car on the road , there happens the traffic jamming even on the highway road . not only for korea , it is the worldwide problem . many country are suffering from traffic jam . government will surely make policy to try to reduce car population and traffic jam . and one other problem a serious a above is the environmental thing . car cause pollution in many way , most seriously , the engine gas of car make the sky foggy and dirty . it cause contagious eye disease , and respiratory problem . in adittion , it promotes the global warming which is making mankind very afraid of . the carbon dioxide in the engine gas make the heat from the sun not able to get out of the earth . and then the water level uprises and cover available land of u . maybe we lose our whole earth to live . if car wo n't decrease , there will happen a crisis of the entire human race . moreover , the remnant oil and gas is decreasing now , and in about 40 year , there will be no oil to depend on . in present point of view , we ca n't live without oil and gas . they are used to make fabric , circulating plant and factory , and more and more . if we use all of them driving car , the thing will happen a lot sooner . so till we have a great resource to replace oil and gas , we should try to save it and invent other kind of transportions which are not taking any oil . in the point of view above , there are too many problms with abundance of car . so for people to live , in the global view , they will not have car . ultimately we will be able to see not jamming road and clearer sky with fewer car in the road .
