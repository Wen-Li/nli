i agree with the statement that the student must understand the idea and the concept rather than the student to know or learn the fact because learning the fact will not help him to know about something practically . the best example for this is about the flight , you can only drive the flight only when you know the idea to start the plane and the concept to take off the flight where a learning fact are only useful to tell to others how the flight use to work . so this mean that idea and concept will always help in many way like when the pilot is in trouble so then you would atleast know that how to land the flight a if you know the concept of it how to land the flight down on the runway . another example is for example if you want to create a hardware device , you can only start when you have a basic idea on it , without that it is impossible to create a hradware device . later you need the concept to develop it feature and the perations it need . learning fact is also needed here to make the device complete without any problem which the people who had worked on the other device before . this make the work more easier than getting into the trouble . but here we give impotance mainly to the idea and concept rather than learning the fact this fact would only help u to complete the device quickly . so student have to understand the idea and the concept which help them in future when they want to research anything or they want to develop any product which is already existing . as they get succeeded they think or get idea of doing more research and development . so idea and concept are more important the learni
