nowadays , the world is getting closer and closer . people want to travel around in their holiday . though we can travel without tour guide at any place , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . first , one of the reason why we travel is to experience new circumstance and environment . so , we can face some difficulty and danger while we are travelling . if there is a tour guide around , we can escape those danger effectively . second , tour guide are specialist who know well about the tourist attraction and famous place of the area . so , we can see around a many place a we can with the guide of the tour guide . usually we do not have enough time to travel the whole region . under the time limit , we can travel more effectively with the tour guide . third , if we travel in group with many people , we can share information and talk together . if we are lucky , we can make friend and keep in touch with the person after the travel . as for me , i love to meet other people and share thought with them . thus , i would travel in a group led by a tour guide rather than travelling alone . there are also many good point of travelling without tour guide . we can make the itinerary on our own and that could be a pleasure for u . also , we can get time to think about ourselves while travelling alone and can get deep understanding of ourselves . but , i would rather choose to travel with a professional tourguide because there are more strength point than travelling without tourguide .
