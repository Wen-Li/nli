nowadays , many people just study what they want to know , waht they like and what they intersted in , they did't care the gratuarer , they want to get master even the doctor . so these people only know the specific subject well , however , others they do not know a many a others . if you enter into the university , if you want to make more friend , you had better know anything about the world , not only math , bescause many peopel did not want to talk about that at part time , therefor , you should know many other academic subject , like physicis biology and so on , these are more interested than the math subject . if you enter into the society , you should have broad knowlege of many academic subject in order to sovles any problem you will met in the future , and you can talk with the others in everywherer . that will give you many advance campare with others . i am a student who like sport very well , you can see me anytime at the basketball corse , i can play it all day if i have the chance , but erey time come back to home , my sister and brother are talk each other , they always say somethings with music , however i do not konw that very well , so i just stay in my house and read the book about basketball . conclusion , what i write above is my idea , if you do not have a borad knowleage of many academic subject you will not live in this
