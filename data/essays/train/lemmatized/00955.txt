i strongly disagree with this statement which say that , `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' there are some some reason so that i disagree with it . the main reason is , it is law that , you have to tell everything whether it is prons or con of the product to customer . as i talked about the law , it is the responsibility of the employer to give the right information to the customer . if they break the law and not give the right information about the product , and hide something ( defect ) to customer , customer can sue on it . if it proof in the court , they lose their licence permanently . another reason is that they lose the people 's trust and it will be more important for them . so they never cheat the people whether it is advertisement or somthing else . by advertise wrong information , they make a big mistake and may be they lose thier buisness too . taking a good example of any electronics company , which produced different type of electronic equipment . suppose company advertise the computer system . if they do n't mention the limitation with it advantage , and someone buy that computer without knowing it limitation then company ha to take back , if customer not satisfied with it . sometimes some company do these kind of mistake but it is out of law . so every company advertise their product without giving any false information , and this way customer make trust on the company , and they sell more and more product , and make big profit .
