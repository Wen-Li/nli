in spite of the general economic developpment of most of the people on the planet allowing more and more citizen to earn their own car , the lack of petroleum could also stop the increasing growth of production of car worldwide . petroleum is not an infinite ressource , and gasoil is made of it . everybody know that there will no longer be available petroleum in fifty year ! this idea conveys a surrounding concern for environmemt , the protection of our planet and the preservation of our energetic ressources . in order to concretize these idea , people started already to share car , a they share flat . sharing car prevents from economic and energetic wasting . citizens are encouraged to take public transport such a bus or metropolitan instead of using their car for short distance . scientists also lanched researched to find some way to replace car , or at least replace gasoil . but we can not deny that the general economic developpment encouraged by liberalism and globalization allows more and more people to own their car . in this generalized consumer society , people can easily be lent some money to buy more and more consumer good , such a car . the globalization launched a well an increase in communication all over the world . commercial exchange , and new communication medias such a phone or the internet seem to be in their golden age . humans are developping a new way of living based on flexibility and mobility in which car are absolutely necessary . a major americam research center published a theory about what the world would become in the next decade . it state that human are unaware of their wasting petroleum , and that they will be unable to prevent the lack of it . the study predicts the fall of globalization : people will have to save on transport to spare some gasoil , and local marked will dramatically increase . all economic activity will return to their geographic origin and teare will no longer be delocalisations . up to my opinion , i donnot share such a radical point of vue but i agree that people should save on petroleum . i predict that more and more exchange will use medias . people will not have to move to meet others or even to work . people will use the internet to work at home , organizing meeting with their colleague . i think that , besides the decrease in the use of car in the next two decade , there will be an expand of individuality and a loss of humanity .
