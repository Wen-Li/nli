as far a i am concerned i think that the people in our daily society need their car . you feel free if you can take the the car and go shopping for example . but you also see the deep impact of the globalization . if everybody take his car every day the nature will be polluted . so you do n't have to forget the nature . i think we will not have more car in twenty year than today because i think that science and economy will find another transport type . the oil price are very high today so i ca n't imagine that the car industry will increase . i think another transport type will appear like the transrapid above the building . another reason is that the world population increase and so i think there is no space anymore to provide all people with car . do i guess that the natural resource are limited and so if there is no oil anymore you have to find a solution . maybe you can support the car with solar cell but this method will be very expensive . so in my opinion scientist have to find another way to bring the people from one point to the other point . the old traditional way to come from one point to the other point will discussed . if you ride with your bike to the university or you want to go shopping you will also support you health . so i can imagine that something appears helping the people to remain fit . our daily society is full of people having more weight than healthy . why we do n't connect two thing . the health and the movement . ok , i am a sporting man and feel better when i ride with my bike to the next city . but who ha the same thought that i have . nobody . the world is governed by people who want to live fast and who do n't have any time to relax . time is money and therefore i think the car industry doe not increase but the world will find a solution to make the life easier for those dreaming of it .
