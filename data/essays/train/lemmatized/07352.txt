ok , first of all i cant say that i agree or disagree because some time i agree and some time i do n't becouse i think that depends on the person hem self and his charecter , if that person can stand up for risk and challanges that he 's going to face by takeing that way ? ! now i will asume that you want me to give or choose only one of the answer so am going with no , i for one do n't think that a successful people should try doing new thing and to take risk . 1 - because he could fail to succed in that new feild and then he wont be taken a a successful person . 2 - if he fails to succed in that he will waist abig period of time by taking a risk and most likelly he will feel down and dispointed in hem self . 3 - i belive that people should do what they love most because then they will do there best in it to succeed . 4 - in my obenion i see that it much better to know what am doing than feeling lost with something new on me . 5 - i think that if aperson have a goal that he want to achive he must do his best to get to his goal and not to let risk to stand in his way even if he fails sometimes he should go back and try again and to tell him self that he did't fail but he learnd something new that this is the wrong way to it , thats what adison saied to him self after 1000 of faild experiment to invent electresty . finlly , the seccessful peoson is the person who go after his dream .
