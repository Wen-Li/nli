some people believe that , in about twenty year from now , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in my point of view , i do not agree with such assertion , and i have two major rearons for my view . firstly , i am aware of the fact that people love car . from the time the human were able to build airplane and automobile , these dream and the realization became the pride of the century . the history of the automobils stand for a turning point for the modern world . poeple design car , and they cherish what they have done to open the market and world for automobile . successful example such a the volkswagen and the bmw have been the symbol of the glamour of this industry . therefore , in such a period of time of twenty year , car will still hold the love for million around the world . the number of prodction will only be steady , if only not to increase . secondly , we need the automobile industry to provide job opportunity . as a result , a we need this industry to grow at a steady pace , we need automobile in our life . imagine thousand of commuter boarding onto the public transportaiton in a single week . it would not only be a huge burden for the the transportaiton system , but also affect many aspect of our life . overall , in the next twenty year , i do not think that there will be fewer car . we need car regardless what the world will become .
