first of all , i do agree with this opinion . i have to admit that the advertisement are essential asset for any business of late . in order to succeed , the company ha to market their product by using a good image . people would prefer to have the one which wa better presented visually . i believe that people usually prone to judge by it own cover before actually examming it . those advertisement company know this well and they manupilate the public image of them which lead u to consume . for instance , the supermarket chain marks and spencers ha been widely succeeding with their tv advertisement for the food line . i think this is a good example for how people 's reaction rely on the image they presented . when you see those tv spot , you would find irresistable for those product . overall , i think it 's simply the nature of marketing to make commodity look better
