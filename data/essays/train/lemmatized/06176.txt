man ha invented various mode of transport , right for very invention of the wheel , to move from one place to another . the want to reach his destination faster and easier ha made him invent machine and road that would serve his purpose . the car , an invention of the 19th century , ha brought in a paradigm shift in the way he travel from one place to another . today , a car ha become a part of modern world that it would be difficult to imagine commuting to work or going on a holiday on your own with your family without a car . i for one would n't agree to the statement that in twenty year there would be fewer car in use that there are today . though , almost all car of today run on gasoline , which is a fast depleting resource , we have developed technology to aid u find oil reserve both in the deep sea a well a in the middle of the dessert . also , some japanese car manufacture like honda ha invented hybrid car that run on alternate fuel like hydrogen . these car are known to be very eco-friendly and not emitting the polluting gas like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide a in the case of internal combustible car of today . though hybrid car are expensive being a very recent invention , over the year , these would be accessible to people at large at affordable price . thus , the problem of for oil & gas reserve would become le important . moreover , due to the large number of car , we do face other problem like noise pollution and heavy vehicular traffic in many international city of the world . these problem are being addressed by building super highway for people to have a smoother ride to their office and home . in conclusion , with car having become ubiqutous a of date , it would be difficult to imagine road having le traffic . however , i do n't disagree that with well maintained , sophisticated public transport system and stringent state law , vehicular traffic can be substantially reduced a in the city of singapore keeping in consideration the above said problem of depleting oil reserve , increased air and noise pollution and heavy vehicular trafic in the city and town .
