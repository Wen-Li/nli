in my opinion , there are both , advantage and disadvantage about trying new thing and taking risk . some people might feel relunctant to change method of a successful company , others might feel more open about it . i used to be the person who doe not take a lot of risk in the past , but recently my attitude ha changed . i think that being successful in life , just can be achieved by trying new thing and taking risk . for example , a member of a football team . if he just reacts and play safely meaning making no fault , he can not get a better soccer player . he just stay at his level , but doe not become a professional player one day . a soccer player who want to achieve someting , ha to take risk . this risk can be changing the soccer team where he ha stayed for five year to a successul , better team where he doe not know the member , the coach or the surrounding of this team . taking risk and trying new thing can also have some negative aspect . if you take risk , there will always be the opportunity to make it wrong , to loose something . but if you do not make fault , you wo n't learn about thing and decision you made . an example for a sport where you can not take any risk is the formula one . the race driver can not take risk , because every fault can cause death for them . so , the level of taking risk for car pilot in the formula one , is very low . they have to drive successful , meaning driving fast , but it is very important for them and their team to drive safely . to sum it all up and to summarize my opinion about the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than onlz doing what they already know how to do well '' , i would say that successful people have to take risk , but there are some situation or some job where zou have to do what zou have learned .
