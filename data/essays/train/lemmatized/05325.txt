as far a i am concerned , young people have not all the same behaviour with their community . obviously , different people have different interest and thought . as a consequence , this question is extremely difficult . however , i quite agree whit this statement . in fact , i think that almost all young child who live in my neighbourhood do not take care our community . last year , for istance , i have helped the priest of my church to look after some elderly people who had some deseases . i have to do this activity with other people of my community , but only one person wa a friend of mine , i mean a person who ha my age . another example wa the little party that my community organise every summer at the end of the school . this is an occasion for u , who live very close , to meet each other , and have fun together . in this day a lot of child and young people participate to the event . however , they usually do nothing to organise this party . only your parent either cook delicious cake and other food or organised game , such a volleyball or football . according to me , there are a lot of reason young child have in order not to help their community . first of all , they attend school in the morning , and in the afternoom they should do their homework . othertime , the practice sport all the afternoon or meet same friend of their in order to relieve stress and have fun , and so on . for example , last year i started to attend university quite far from my house , consequently i have spent le time in my community and i can understand the problem young people have to face . taking everything into account , it is true that nowadays only few young people do something to improve their community . however , i think that help our community is both a right and a duty for everyone . in particular young child can either improve many skill by doing this , or learn important knowledge for their future life , that are not writter in book .
