althougth i woud like that it is not true , i am agree with this statement , because it is that happens nowadays . in fact , the majority of young people do not give enough time to helping their community , because they are not enough interested of their community , and of the probelms of them . i think that the people of the generation before this have not the same behaviour , and i do not know why now that happens . i supposed that the parent ha not learnt to their son the importance of helping their community . therefore , many young people are interested only of their problem , maybe very little problem , and of their , probably , few friend . they do not consider the community 's problem , and the problem of each member of the community . therefore they do not keep part in solving that , he do not give their precious contribute .
