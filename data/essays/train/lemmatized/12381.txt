i dont personally believe that after twenty year there will be fewer car than there are today . there can be many claim supporting it . the world is progressing fast and making advancement in each and every field . the major advancement are in the field of science and technology . there ha been continuous attempt to improve and develop newer and more car . time is very precious for every individual . suppose you have to attend a very important meeting and ypu plan to take a bus or a metro , if you are lucky you get the conveyance the moment you reach , but wat if you just missed the bus . then , to your utter dissappointment you will have to wait for the next bus , which obviously mean that you 'll reach late at the meeting or will have to miss the meeting , if it happens that that day there all the bus n other conveyance are stopped . either of it will put a bad impression on the other staff . cars , though not the fastest but are most efficient and easy mode of travel if a person ha to travel a short distance . now about the long journey like the cross country journey , obviously it not very feasible to use a car for it . as it will amount to a large petrol consumption and will often be more expensive . but some people who are nature lover , and enjoy watching nature and greenary prefer using car . for long distance travel , the flight being cancelled and late can cause a delay and also various other inconvenience to the passenger . to cater to these need of a person and most importantly to save time , the demand of the car are increasing , and thus it number is increasing . though we have many efficient and comfortable conveyance like aeroplane , metro train , but at time they may take up more time than car . and a the world 's becoming fast day-by-day , our need to save time and thus our need of car is increasing day by day . the technological development being made also favor and increase to increase profi
