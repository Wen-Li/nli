without any doubt iam strong agree with this statement because i see thiough my experences that we must keep our student understand any thing which we learnd to them not just give them the fact of any subject and , keep them to understand the fact with thierselves because they may do not anderstand the fact in the right way so this thing sure will make wast of our life . for example of my opinion : when we learnd the student about some thing such a learning or education it is very important thing and everyone should learn , when we told them these word just without make them like it do you know what this mean ? this mean that our chieldren may learn some time but , witgout beliving ant of information and the information do not keep in thier maind any more time after finshing thier high school for example . another example is when i take with any one who want to drive car about the method of driving and saving others life this person should understand exactly why i mean because if not he or she may drive fast so this will make a very big waste for all . in a word i think that understand any small thing in our student life will save our life and i thi thin ; thise the very important thing and , this the resposbilty of parent and teacher .
