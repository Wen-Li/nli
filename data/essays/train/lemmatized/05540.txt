i think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first , the motive for producer to make their product seem better than they really are is that producer want to convince consumer to buy their product . today 's competition among company in business world is like wartime . for a company to survive and make profit a company need to sell a many product a possible and raise revenue . second , a company can make product seem better than they really are because consumer do not have enough information about product . even though company make false comment about product consumer can not tell comment are true or false . some consumer may be too busy to look for information to judge whether comment are made correctly or not . also , the fact that the function of the product in market are not very different play a role in making false advertisement . since the function of the product in market are so similar to each other consumer will be easily convinced to buy product if consumer hear comment by producer that point only to strong point of product and exaggerate the feature of the product . third , people are more easily convinced by visual image than other type . if a product look better than other product , a consumer might want to buy that product even without obtaining information regarding fuctions . in conclusion , producer make product seem much better than they really are through advertisement because producer want to survive in competition and consumer do not have proper information and are more susceptible to visual image .
