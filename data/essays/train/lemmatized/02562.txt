it seems possible to affirm that most advertisement make product look much better than they really are . however , one must not forget that that is the `` nature of the beast . '' after all , company hire a multi-billion dollar machinery to convince u , avid consumer , of our need to look just like the perfect model from suburbia that are used not only to sell product , but also to use our vanity and lust to lure u to buy , buy , buy . let me give you an example of the way advertisment company use our desire to look great and to be desired to make u buy their product . two day ago i went to the movie theater . while i wa waiting for my movie to begin , i wa bombarded by a miriad of commercial advertising all sort of product , all the way from beauty cream to cigarrettes . after the third commercial with the sporty type advertising gym clothing , a membership to a trendy sport facility and the required pill to burn fat , i wa feeling fat , grossly inadequate , and ready to run so that i could get all i needed to get on the right track . all of a sudden , a deep realization struck me : all of that can not be real ! i can exercise to the point of exhaustion , get all the right clothing , take all the prescribed pill -- not by a medical doctor , mind you -- and even then , i will never look like the blonde , blue-eyed , muscular guy on the screen . do n't believe me yet ? just ask yourself : how many curvacious woman or apollinean guy have greeted you at the car dealership last time you bought a new car ? some people would like to say that advertisement are nothing but a clear reflection of the product they offer . while i am willing to concede that there is just little you can do to make a glass of milk look more apetizing than what it is , one ha only to look at the `` got milk ? '' advertisement to get the point : to advertising company , it doe not matter if what they are offering is a good a they say it is , or even if the attention of the consumer is not so much on the product they are selling but on the personality they are using to advertise it , what matter to them is that it sell . how many time have you been moved to get the trendiest , newest , more expensive brand of clothing , cellular phone , car , etc. just to discover after a brief period of usage that , in spite of all the empty promise and alluring technique used by the advertising company , what you got is nothing but apiece of trash ? think about the famous marlboro commercial . how many people thought that smoking wa a fancy activity just by looking at the romantic sunset with the cowboy looming on the horizon ? how about the effect of smoking on your health ? care to talk about cancer and related illness ? obviously , truth-telling and advertising do not go hand-in-hand . most advertisement company want one thing and only one : to sell their client ' product . if they need to lie , modify , or even disguise the real product or it effect in order to sell it , that is exactly what they will do . got milk lately ?
