i disagree with the statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . cars are the most important mean of transport in today world where people prefer to travel more than other mean of transportation . they play an very important role in once life . in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today because in the modern world people are very bussy with there work and they have to travel to a very far place from where they reside to do there work so they have to travel fast to manage there time . so they need a vehicle in which they can go on very fast so car fullfills the need . in case of other transportation like the public transportation where they have to wait for the public vehicle to come so they are a wasting a lot of time . so most people do not prefer . and many other people have a passion towards car and they like to drive car . so people buy car because of there passion . because of this reason some family will have more than two to three car . car is a prestige issue so this is the reason the average middle class family is also buying a car . and according to the recent survey people prefer to buy the car than to any other mean of transportation . and because of this there is a large increase in the sale of the car in the recent year many car manufacturing comming up for this reason . and when we compare the sale of the car say from 1930 's there is a considerable rise in the sale of the car say at an avereage it is 60 % then the same is going to continue in the future . so by this we can say that we will be using more car than today . because of the above mentioned reason i strongly disagree that there will be fewer car in twenty year from today .
