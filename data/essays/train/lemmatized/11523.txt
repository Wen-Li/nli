many people are trying to find the way that lead to a successful life . the proposed theory mean that to be successful you have to dare doing new thing instead of focusing on what you already know to do well . i do not agree with such a thesis . first , many people are successful only by doing what they know how to do well . if you do thing better than others do , you have great chance to succeed in your project . for instance , a lot of sport champion only focus on their sport and do not lose time besides . for example , roger federer , the current best tennis player in the world , wa learnt tennis since he wa very young and went on in this way which lead him to success . whereas a lot of well known singer who tried to play in film did not manage in this way and went back to what they did well . neverlethess , many amazing success story happened to people who tried to do something new . for instance , the famous former tennis player yannick noah , after a good carrier a a tennis player , ha become a very famous singer . consequently , if i do not really agree with the thesis i have to acknowledge that it is possible to be successful in other field that the one you are meant to . so , my point is that even if you are doing well in something , this doe not mean that you can do well eslewhere . on the contrry , i think that people who have been successful in the field they were prepared for have better chance to have great achivements in others field because they have been learnt how to commit in a project , to be professional and to believe in themselves .
