`` old is gold '' but i dont agree with that . young people enjoy more than the older one because they are more enthusiastic , hot - blooded and strong determination besides that old people have many problem like , they have responsibility , disease etc . young people are more enthusiastic . they are called building stone of a country . the more number of young people in country , more strong the country is . the strengthen of any country can be recognised by it number of young people . young people have strong determination and can enjoy every part of life . they can be adjusted to any environmeant easily . they can do lot of fun and can enjoy adventurous life like they can do para-gliding , para-sailing , river-rafting , trekking etc which is impossible for the older people . young people are hot-bloodedmeans they are very keen to do anything they want , so this also implies their determination of doing thing . young people have a good resistance power of resisting disease so they can eat everything they like . psycologically say old people also want to enjoy their life but they cant because of many problem which appear on them due to old age . by walking a few distance they get tired so how can they are going to trek and all that thing . the old people doesnt have a good resistance power they fall prey if they eat anything outside what that is suggested by the doctor . so they cant travel place to place to explore the world a at different place they cant get the food that is prescribed to them . they also cant adjust to climate . they also cant resist long travelling . young people , for example go to pub , disco , enjoy the night lifeof the city , can ride on a motorcycle through out the city while old people cant even imagine do that , they just sit at home and enjoy the tv . the tv is only the entertainment source for them . if the old people even try to enjoy they have to enjoy at their home only . so there is very little space to enjoy for the old people while young people can enjoy through out the world .
