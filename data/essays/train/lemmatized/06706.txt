i think it is true that the younger people enjoy more of their life than the older people do . and i have three point to support with . first , younger age is `` free '' . except going to school and doing homework , young people have more time than the elder . considering `` adult '' spending time with anything regarding their job , such a meeting and getting ready for the presentation or even raising child , it is obvious that young people have more time than the older people do . second , young people have le to worry about . new house , paying tax , promotion , raising child . these are none of the option that younger people would have in mind to consider . the few thing they might think of would be boy/girlfriends , schoolwork , college or getting job even . except few group of peole who take them too seriously , those are not desperately important or i should say `` deep '' matter . comparing to those of adult , young people have le thing to concern , which help them to enjoy their time even more . third , and for the last , young people is literally `` young '' . they have more chance to try out for many thing . for example , the adult usually do n't get chance to try out for musical or sport team if their major or field are different . but in middle or high school , or even in college , young people get lot of chance to try a bit of everything , so to speak . and i think the more you try , there 's more possibility that you 'll like , and have a good time . so for these three reason , i think young people have more chance to , and do enjoy life more than older people do .
