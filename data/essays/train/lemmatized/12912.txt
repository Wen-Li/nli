nowadays , more and more people say that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do . they think that many young people buy the luxruy thing , spend more and more time and money on the internet and video game . the older people , however , always spend theri time to do the housework , or watch the tv at home . but doe it true that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do ? i think i can not agree with this saying . because every peorid of one 's life ha it own feature . we can not only say that the young people enjoy life more than older people do . firstly , older people always think everything in their way , so maybe they think the next generation always not good a them . for example , the kid who were born in 1960 's and after were called the generation ca n't support . but they are the main part of the economy and poltic now . they are excellent a their father and grandfather . so the viewpoint that the young people enjoy life more than older people is just a stereotype . secondly , i think every old people ha ever been young before . so they must know that the young people is much more active than older people . they know go to club or play basketball when they are free . they can not stop moving . but it is not to enjoy the life , it is the instinctive of the young man . that not mean that the young man enjoy the life more the older people . thirdly , many older people know how to enjoy the life more than the young people . because many young people do n't have enough money to enjoy the life . they need to word . but the older people who ha earned enough money to use during the holiday , or buy the expensive car , etc . so the older people maybe know how to enjoy the life more than young people .
