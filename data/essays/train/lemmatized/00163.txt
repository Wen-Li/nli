success is the fruitful result that a person get after a job ha been accomplished correctly and in the manner it ha to be done . failures are a stepping stone to success and one must try and try until he succeeds in doing his thing in the right manner that is needed . for instance an ant who wanted to climb a wall tried several time but failed . though not fairing in climbing the wall the ant did n't lose the zeal to get to the top of the wall . later it succeded in climbing the wall . likewise one must have persevarance to try and try until they succeed in doing the job they wish to accomplish . another person named mc milan who invented cycle could not have invented it unless he tried several time . in our day to day life famous doctor would not have become surgeon simply by sitting and starring . they needed to pick up the scalpel and do the surgery . bypass surgery wa done in a person and when the person had the problem with the heart the doctor had to come up with a new technique . later they ended up in doing heart transplantation . all these would not have been achieved if the person simply did n't try during my childhood i thought i couldnot ride a cycle but later on i got courage and learnt cycling , later id did n't stop with that i learnt a motor bike . if i would not have tried riding motor bike i would have ende up by simply learning cycling . later i managed to learn the car . from these example i conclude saying that one should not end up by getting a result for a job that he ha done rather he ha to take risk in his life and keep on trying to get new thing done .
