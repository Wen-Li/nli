personally , i would agree with this statement , and the raesons are fairly simple . facts alone can not help you much , a better understanding of concept will help in the developing of new idea , and if we only focus on fact , we will miss the big picture . facts alone can not help anyone alone . an ideal example would be a detective tryiong to solve a crime . let 's say the detective have all the fact he got all the information or evidence he need , but he still need to understand these fact and evidence . he will need a reason for the crime , an understanding of human feeling and reaction to certain situation because without a good understanding these all the evidence and information are worthless . a complete understanding of the concept will help u create new idea . for example . imagine a scientist trying to come with anew theory of the atom . these scientist need to understand all of the concept and reasonig that involve the atom because if we do not understand the past how can we create a better future . it is said that t make an objectical abservations we should trow all of our emmotions away , and only focus on the fact . that might be true for machine or any kind of object because they do not posse emmotions . however , when we are making observation about an person or anything that have emotion this would only cause problem . imagine that aperson id being trial for fighting with another man for no apparent reason . this man should suffer some kind of punishment for doing this . however , let 's say this man 's wife had a car accident the afternoon of the day of the fight , and now she is in a critical state fighting for her life . the man who had never had any kind of trouble break apart and decides to go for a drink , but he get drunk and start punching the man sittin beside him . should this man be punish for doing this ? . h is a critical moment his wife might die . the point is tha people can not be judge only on fact .
