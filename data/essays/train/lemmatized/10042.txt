i agree with this statement . because to have many knowledge is useful . it can be material of chatting , and have interest for many thing . you can talk with many people in many categolies . if you know a lot of thing , you might to try many thing . for example , when you got fired your job , you could find another job which you have interest , maybe . and a person , who have a knowledge of many kind of subject , might help other people using his/her knowledge . anyway , i think to have a lot of knowlage is not to be waste . i like the person who know many thing . it 's interesting .
