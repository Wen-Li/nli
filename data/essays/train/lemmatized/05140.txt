i do agree with the statement reported below for the following reason : 1. as i personally experinced in my academic history , fact are not easy to remember for a long time . this wa expecially true when i had to study a lot of subject at the same time for my exam , after a week or two i could no longer remember most of the fact i learned but on the over end i can still remember the idea and concept . a good example is related to my history class , i can not rember all the data or the fact that occured during the modern history , but i can still remember the idea and the concept that have been expressed in those time . 2. ideas and concept that you learn in class when you are a student are more usefull in the real life when you are not a student anymore . you can apply them not only in the subject in which you have learnt them , but also to different area . this is not possible with fact that actually can be applied only to the subject they are related to . 3. students through the studing of idea and concept have also the great possibilty to improve themself by learning a new way of thinking and by having the chance to learn new concept which have been experinced by great person ( e.g.historical person , scientist , etc . ) . expecially in this period of time in which young people follow wrong idea expressed through the modern comunication system ( e.g. medium , internet , radio , etc ) . finally , for the reason expressed above i think that concept and idea are more important than fact , for a better future for our student .
