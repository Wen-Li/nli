i totally agree with the opinion that most advertisement make product seem much better that htey really are . first of all , the objective of the advertisement make the sale of product increase . in order to do this , advertisement emphasize only good point about the product and not mention the bad point . for example , when new small car is realased , in the commercial , it is enphersized that the car is affordable , but they do not mentin the capacity is really small because the point is not attractive for buyer . also , we can see that many advertisments overrate the product or hide something behind the value of product . for example , in the advertisement about exercising machine , they mention how much effective the machine is . but often we can see the comment like , `` this is not typical result '' or '' you have to control the diet '' . consumers can not notice these comment because these are written in very small print . additionaly , popular movie star or famous people in the advertisement attract people . in this case , they trust the fame of the star , but they do not check the product well . even though many people that know they should not be tricked or they should look into product themselves , the degree of tactic of advertisement are very high .
