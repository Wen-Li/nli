nowdays , more and more student sucess their baccalaureat . however , it appears that their knowledge are not very good . therefore , some people think that we have to re-organize the educational system . so , is it more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ? first , the comprehension of something begin in observing fact . for example , in chemistry , we can do an experience , observe it , and then we have to understand the reaction . so , i think that it is really important to understand idea and concept . it is the first step of the knowledge . it is the minimum . next , if we forget this idea and concept , it is not important to understand it ! but education can not stop here . if we only understand idea and concept , we do not have enough knowledge to understand other thing . to improve it knowledge , we have to learn fact . indeed , learn fact equal get experience . in the schorlarship , learn fact must mixt with `` understand idea and concept '' . in one time , student only learnt course by heart and sometimes they did not understand . thus , if student only learn lesson , it is not enough . in my opinion , a good educational sytem is not only a system where student just learn fact . they olso have to understand idea and concept : it is not more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . we can not done a difference between this two system .
