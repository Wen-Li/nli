idea and concept when undrestood are the best accompanies of understanding something i agree that it important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact understanding is that all count and the learned fact are second one to be counted . we come to know of some idea which influence are thinking and route it into a specific path . it is this understanding of a problem which lead to an idea for solving the problem . learned fact may be helpful but can never be perfect solution for a problem a they are not thought off but are learned . learned fact can give u direction for thinking and but finally it an idea that strucks up and provide the solution . concept is the basic knowledge of how thing work or go on . it is an understanding of the basic fundamental behind the working of the product . concept must bre understood rather than being learnt blindly . as the concept provide the base for thinking to build upon and idea is to sprout a learned fact is the result of someone else thinking process and the to which he ha arrived for example the concept of working of petrol engine is different from the diesel engine , a in case of the petrol engine spark plug is used for combustion whereas in diesel engine the fuel is compressed to a great extent in comparision to the petrol engine . so a person who ha just learned the difference can only reproduce the fact in an examination but if he is asked to explain the concept behind them he would be blank learned face . also knowing the concept and just thinking of idea over the concept take the student to new technology and which l finally it more important for a student to understand the idea and concept rather than just learning the fact .
