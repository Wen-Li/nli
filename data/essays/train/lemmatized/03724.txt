in my view , it is better to have a knowledge on a specialize subject rather than having broader knowledge of many academic subject because if the person is carrer oriented then he ha to specialized in that particular field instead learning all the subject which is a waste of time and money . this not only save one time but also give the thorough and coherent knowledge and skill about that subject . the reason that i agree with this point is that i have observed one of my classmate who wa very much interested in all the subject and plus he wa career oreinted too . he spends time gaining knowledge of the subject . at last , when the real time came , he wa helpless and finally didnt succeed in his career . by seeing his expereince i have learnt that `` the more you learn , the more you forget '' and finally you will be remauned with a single pie in your hand . so knowledge in term of academic aspect depends on your interest and career . so if you want acquire more knowledge , you have to sacrifice the other part of life . by this a nice proverb can be evolved `` a bird in hand is worth than two ina bush '' . this implies if you are interested in one particular field then stay tuned to that paricular field rather than showing interest in various activity . but some part of the statement sound sometimes true because through his knowledge only we acquire wisdom . if the person have the knowledge with wisdom he can stand tall in life . for ex : - john abraham . through his wisdom only america is successful today . coming back to the point , if one doe his work in a specific and significant way , he can achieve success , so i totally disagree with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one subject '' .
