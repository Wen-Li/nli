it is difficult to say that whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subject or not . if you ask to me , i prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subject for several reason . according to me , having wide broad knowledge about several topic help you to be more social , to compete in bussiness environment and to aware yourself in your field of study . first of all , in my opinion , if you have more knowledge on many subject then you could easily get friend . you would not have difficulty to talk with a new person . consider that you meet someone who is computer science student in a party and you know something about satellite . all right ! this is a great change to start a conversation if you like to talk him or her . secondly , bussiness life becoming more and more competitive today . how much topic do you know is more important than how detail in one topic dou you know nowadays . bosses prefer to hire a person who have several experience on many topic . if you look at job offering today , you will see a long list of expected knowledge . it department are example to this situation . although a person is hired to development department of it , it is expected from him to know about security , database sytems or something else . in addition to the second reason , i think that if you have broader knowledge , you could easy change your field of study . if you dont want to work on database system , you could work on security system . thirdly , i you have broad knowledge , you will know where you are and you can test yourself that you exactly want this field of study . do you exactly want to study in art or study in geology ? if you know a little bit knowledge about other fileds then you feel comfortable with your choice . in conclusion , my choice about this topic is to have broad knowledge on many academic topic .
