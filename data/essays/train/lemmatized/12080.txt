although it an ambitious and challeging motive to have a broad knowledge about many academic subject , i would rather prefer to have knowledge about one perticular subject . there are few reason for which i feel this way . firstly , a knowledge all subject mean a lot of information and plenty of hardwork and time for gaining the information . as a result of this complex interaction of the above factor , most of time adequate knowledge of any of the subject is not aquired . as a result of this a person becomes a jack of all trades but master of none . secondly , lot of sujects mean lot of hardwork , and there would be too little time for personal life , which mean he will have le time for making new friend , watching movie and partying . after all education is only one part of the curricilum , there are many other activity to be done to make an all round personality . as a result of this his social life might be affected , and he will fit into the classic old saying , all work and no play make jack a dull boy !! finally , at the end of his education period if he feel that there is no looking back for him , since he ha aquired all the knowledge , he is then dumped again . once in professional life , people prefer those who are specialist in a perticular subject rather than those who have only a moderate knowlege of it . for example a person with high blood pressure and respiratory difficulty would go to a cardiologist , than to go to a general physician or a family doctor . he will feel that he would get a more precise treatment under a cardiologist 's help . in conclusion , eventhough just think to aquire all the knowledge in the world sound good , it is practical to have complete knowledge about one aspect .
