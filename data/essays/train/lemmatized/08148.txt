i 'm not sure that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than today but i really hope that this will happen . today the situation is not good for the big presence of car and science and gouvernaments must do something to solve this problem and to limit the damage that this car 's presence give to the environment . twenty year ago there were le car : this is a sign of our economical and technological improvement but this improvement take u a lot of problem that were unthought year ago . the biggest problem is the pollution of air that we breath because of the car 's gas . this problem brought to the water pollution too and provoked the birth of a lot of new illness that did n't exist year ago . so i hope that in future the number of car should decrease to have le pollution and to have a good environment . another solution could be found in some improvement of science to eliminate the pollution provoked by car . another negative aspect of the high number of car is that , expecially in the city , every day , there are a lot of car that crowd it and give problem to traffic . so a decrease in number of car should give more quiteness to city and should be easier for people going from a part to another of a city . a solution in this case must be found by gouvernaments that should decrease the car into city improving the public transport . if the net of public transport is well organised , i think that people would be stimolated to use it and to leave car at home and so would n't be so important having two or three car per family . so , in conclusion i think that with a small improvement of science and of gouvernament 's control will be fewer car in use than there are now , and i hope that this will happen so we can live in healthness and in quietness a the life wa twenty year ago .
