i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the most important part of learning is it application . just the knowledge of fact wont take an indivisual to summit of success . it is when someone can throughly get hold of the idea and concept , he can create , understand , and anallize thing better . one can not limit idea and concept they can be extended to any dimenssions but on the other hand fact can be concidered just a summarization of the idea and concept . facts are important a they provide the basic fundamental thinking but they are not the most important one . if a student just limit himself with the fact he stop thinking , thinking in a new dimenssion . one stop reasoning himself and try wheather there could be another theory which could support the idea , is a theory fulproof . all these question are not asked . the person cajole oneself to belive it without questioning . the basis of human existence is to think and work on idea and concept . if the fact that earth is flat a initialy propossed wa relied on , then we would have never known the truth . but it is this understanding of idea and concept that the atom contain smaller element inside we have discovered proton , nutrons and even smaller than that . nature is too complex to understand and whatever is not natural can be wrong . facts about anything can be printed in textbook , narrated by teacher but understanding of idea and concept depends upon one own perception , once own logical reasoning and that is what real education is about , to think to reason and then to act .
