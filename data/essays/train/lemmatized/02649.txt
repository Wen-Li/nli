i tend to agree with the topic that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i believe that an understanding of concept and idea are the stair to higher ground in all field of education . this hold true for subject ranging from science , business , medicine to fine art . if a student is able to grasp the basic idea behind what is being taught then only he can proceed further higher to learn and understand more about the subject . lets take two example , first one would be from the field of science . everybody know the fact that when white light pass through a prism it get divided into light of various color . so is it important to teach a student why the white light get divided into various color or is it sufficient enough for him to learn this fact and learn the name of the color ? it is so important for him to understand the basic concept behind the phenomenon which is that different colored light have different wave lenghts and when passing through a thick glass they get reftracted differently . if he know this basic concept he can take this further and understand the phenomenon of rainbow on his own and never forget it . for my second example i would take take a student who is studying and working towards becoming a musician . in order for him to become accomplished in his field of study he should first learn the various note , chord and other basic concept and idea in music . if the student is only taught the name of the great and the symphony that they created , would that help him anyway in becoming a musician himself ! ? therefore i would like to strongly state that though a student should be taught fact but there is no way that the student can do without an understanding of concept or grasping of idea .
