students who learn to understand the methology of a certain process have enough capacity to quickly identify and solve a problem , eventhough change were done in the example used to explain the new topic . i agree with the fact that state that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is more relevant when a person solves a problem by understaning every step done , than by following all the process by memorization . for example , a mechanical engineer student who is taking the course of statics ha a better probability of getting better grade if he understands all the main concept of the class . teachers explain the theory in problem very different from the one utilized on test . so , when a student only learns the fact about the stress applied to an object with certain geometry , he will not be able to answer the problem if the teacher change the geometry of the object on the test . the student should be able to understand how to apply the related concept in any given situation . in my own experience , i can apply this statement to one of my hobby , playing golf . two year ago when i started practicing this tricky but fun sport , i needed two take class every week . my teacher always remembered me about the importance of doing the movement , `` swing '' , thinking on it , not just doing it automatically . this concept helped me a lot to understand my mistake during the swing . so , this left me the reflection about understanding every step of the movement and not just doing it mechanically . after some time of playing golf , i learned that when you just learn the fact and do not analyze them , you start repeating the same error without identifying them . as a conclusion , this two example showed the importance of understaning idea and concept over just learning the fact . understanding the concept give you the ability to easily recognize any error .
