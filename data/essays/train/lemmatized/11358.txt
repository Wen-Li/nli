we can choose the way to trip from going alone or going a a group wity a tour gude . when you make the plan of trip , which do you choose ? someone will say that going a a group with a tour guide is the best way , because a tour guide tell any infomation and there are no time to make the plan of tour . a tour guide will provide much infomation , but i can not agree with this opinion . trip is my own event , there are my preference . i want to make own plan . time schedule is not free , and it is hard to care group member if i go on a trip a a group . the tour ha the program , a tour guide explain about history or any infomation , then i can not change it . if it differ from my preference , the tour will be boring . it mean waste of money and time . preference of people is various , then it is not the best way to going on a trip a a group . the time schedule is decided in a group tour , it is not free . when i want to take many picture , if i go alone , i can take freely . however , if i go a a group , a tour guide will tell u the time to back . i can not enjoy if there are time schedule that someone decided . the travel a a group ha many member . i have to care about their feeling or preference and talking . it is hard . when i go on a trip , i want to reflesh . the effort of caring member make me tired . it is not good trip . it is better to going alone . as i mentioned above , i can not agree with the opinion that the vest way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . when i go on a trip , i would like to go alone rather than go a a group . i can make the schedule depend on my preference , and make free time schedule . in addition , there are no fere about member .
