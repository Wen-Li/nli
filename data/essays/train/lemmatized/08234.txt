i would like to go with the idea that younger people can enjoy life more vividly than older people do . there are many significant factor to support this idea of younger people exploring the life a much possible a they can and how they go about life in a manner to have sweet memory for their rest of life . if i consider a teenage boy/girl , he/she will be having vigor and enthusiasm to go out for party and hang around with friend which account for their extremely extravagant event which they can cherish later at somepoint in their lifetime after getting older . older people may not have that much energy a the young people to do whatever they want . their physical health may not support their idea to enjoy even though they are very much ready to enjoy . though enjoyment doe n't come only in physical form . they can also enjoy . older people will have to depend upon somebody in their family to go around exploring life a they did when they are young . but this may not be possible always a the other member in the family will be having work and responsibility of their own such a taking care of child , going to office and preference towards their own enjoyment in life . as a result in some society , the older people are being sent to retirement home where they share their rest of life with their peer . but this is not a good culture a it denies the fact of being together in the family . the older people can not enjoy their life a they feel alienated from the society which can worsen the situation . they should be regarded a an important part of the society a they love their family member for whom once they cared and gave in all the possible way for them to enjoy life . in my opinion , enjoyment lie in one 's perception towards it . although younger people can enjoy life more than older people do , they can consider for older people 's enjoyment by mingling with them a they get chance to make the rest of older people 's life lively .
