we are living in a time in wich money is the most important thing . not one of , the most ! often we measure the social importance of a person by measuring the amount of money he/she posse . .. and it doe n't matter whether what we sell is good , usefull , ealthy or not . it is only important we sell it , in order to earn a much a possible and get very important and famous in our society . experts call it business and some time society improvement . but if we think a little more deeply , we realize it is not that . to reach this goal , we use all the tool we can . one of the most effective mean is television . by using tv and it trick , expert are able to persuade people to by thing they do not need at all !! great !! everybody know often advertisement make product brighter than they actually are , but when we are in supermarket , shop , etc , we forget it . .. it is a magical ! i can see that even with some friend of mine . they change mobile very often , but not because their mobile doe n't work any more : just because the new one ha got more capability . .. and they realize they are stupid only when i ask them if they need those new function . .. they do n't . .. and the sadest part of the story is that , often , the most usefull product are not supported by rich company and thus they ca n't get known and spread . while stupid and useless product never keep unknown , a they would deserve : there is always a rich company which sponsorises and spread them ! what a pitty !!
