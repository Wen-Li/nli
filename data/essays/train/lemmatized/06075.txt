the car is most preferred motion medium in the world . in western country , almost each family ha one or more car . in developing country , people aim at having a car . this is usually a proof of success . and these country are still growing , producing and coming to a mass market economy . therefore it seems difficult to see fewer car in the next twenty year . yet this statement could turn out to be true . for other reason which are not directly linked to the comfort of people . nowadays , we can notice that an always greater part of the population feel concerned with environnememt issue . the use of car is directly linked to this new awareness of the population . people became aware of the influence of car gas through climate evolution ( temperature increase , unpredictable storm ... ) , through medical survey ( number of child concerned with asthma , increase of lung illness in the population ) . at least in western country , this awareness could lead to a reduction in the number of car sold . another point is that in big city , people are fed up with the noise generated by the car . an other argument is linked to the increasing oil barrel price . over the past month , the oil barrel ha risen to incredible price . reaching almost 80 $ . even if the price have felt recently to a more acceptable 60 $ a barrel , the car ha become a well in which family throw their money . furthermore , the organization of oil producer said that the price would n't fall under 60 $ a barrel . this situation ha two possible solution . either the scientist develop new fuel for car . this could allow people to use their car or at least to buy new car which meet new environmental requirement and which are then le expensive a they do n't need fuel produced from crude oil . or the car will be outnumbered , especially in big city , by public transportation , a it is the trend today . but they will remain numerous on the countryside where public transportation are le developed . as a conclusion , i will say that i do n't foretell the disappearing of car until quite a long time .
