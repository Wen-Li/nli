i agree that the young people nowadays are not giving time to help their community . the young people a soon a they finish their schooling they awaiting for the college to be opened . though they do not have so much interest they feel that helping their community degrade their presitge and it matter alot . in my point of view not only the young people but also their parent are responsible for that . if they have interest and when they go to help , their parent will restrict them . this doe not happens in all case but some of the parent might be doing . for those parent first they must realize the need of help for their community and encourage their young one . if we take the young people into consideration their parent must be encouraged and the student who are interested in helping the community must form a group and must also encourage the other young people . the problem of the community must be discussed among the group and certain measure must be taken . not only taking the certain measure but also they must be kept into action and the parent must guide their child . this help the young people not only to help their community but also the nation can changed . taking inspiration of small group of young people each and every young person will come forward to help their own community . by helping these community the problem that are suffered by the country can prevented a well a removed . finally young people are the main citizen of the country they should have the responsibility over their family , their community and their country . this help each and every young one to think about themselves a well a about their surroundings . this also help them in building their carreer in the right path .
