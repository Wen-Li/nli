while some think that it is better to learn many academic subject , others believe that it is better to major in only one specific subject . i prefer the latter idea , specializing in one tipical subject , for three reason . at first , i think that people who majored in one specific subject such a law and medic are able to earn a lot of money . for example , in japan , lawyer and doctor are high-classed professional and can earn much money . to the contrary , people who do not have deep knowledge of specific subject can not earn a lot of money . to tell the truth , i am a officer of national tax agency in japan and posse broad knowledge about tax especially cooporate tax , so i can earn 100000 dollers per year owe to my knowledge . second , the reason why i prefer to specializing in one special subject is that student can enjoy their university life . if they learn a lot of academic subject such a economics , history and mathematics , they have little time to use freely . on the other hand , student who study only one specific subject hard can posse a lot of time , so they can do sport or enjoy their academic life . thirdly , i think that student can be interesting in studying if they learn one academic subject hardly . in general , people tend to be interesting the subject a they study more hard and deeper . thus , i think that they will be taste the jo about studying . therefore , for these reason i insist that it is better to study only one specific subject than to learn many academic subject . through my experience , i enjoyed my college life and am be able to earn a lot of money because i studied only about tax .
