i dissagree with the statement that `` there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . now in present generation the need of a car is more essential for each and every individual . the car ha become an essential body to transportation . so the increasing demand among the public will lead to manifacturing the number off car . as the population grows we need more car , for transportation . because the public transportation in the country ha failed , people need more car for transportation , safely and in aproper time . we can also go in car where ever we like to go , what ever time to reach . for example , my father us a car to go to hospital . so a my mother us to go to office . so for different reason we use car , if there is need for the car how can the number off car could decrease in the next twenty year . cars now adays are used by many people to save the time , to go to job and the other place . cars are use full togo along with the family to a picknic . cars are the main public transportation in the united state , a the public transportation ha failed to transport the public . therefore the number of car are not going to decrease in the next twenty year . they are going to become the double the number off car present today on the road . so the government ha to regulate new law to regulate the pollution that the car are going ti produse .
