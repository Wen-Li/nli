i disagree with the statement . because i think idea and concept are made by people . if each of the people life in different country , each of idea and concept are different even though they think about same thing . for example , i would like to talk about world war 2 . my grandfather joind the war a a soldier when he wa 20 . his idea is that the war wa made by several country government . the japanese government is one of them . my brother said that did the japanese government start the war when he saw a movie ` pearl harvar ' . he had little doubt it at that time although he had already learned the war at hisory class for more than ten year ago . some korean friend asked me if i felt guilty for the war and korean . all of these idea are not official statement . but i am sure many people have same idea a those people . they knew about some of the fact . i think if i understand each of idea without the fact , it is not real understanding . when i want to understand some idea and concept , i should focus on what the idea and concept were caused by . this is the most important thing for understanding .
