i almost agree with this statement , but i think some criticize can be inferred . actually for some context it is obviously better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject , like in college or with others student but also to be abble to choose what you want to do . while to be specialize in one specific subject can close some possiblities , but it wil be easier to be outstanding in one specific subject . on the one hand to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is the system of all school , when you are young you do n't learn just french or math , you have learned everything in the same time . there is a reason of this system , he ha been created to be allow the student to be open minded , the history show u how is important to be not focus on only one thing , even the great genius wa n't focused on only one subject . lets take an example , leonard da vinci wa a genius in paint so during his life he ha developed this quality , but not only he wa also interested by the biology , more specefically how the human body work . on the other it allows to choose what you really want to do . for me it is important to have choice between diferents speciality , i mean i have to know a little bit of everything if i want to make a good choice about my future . for example when i wa young i wa really interested by litterature , i started to read really early so i thought maybe the best thing for me is to take litterature class later , but i realized how wrong i wa when i discovered my love for biology . so i decided to not make choice between two thing that i love , i decided to try another academic subject , to know a broad of everything , and maybe later i will specialize . now , i study in law college so i am specialized but it 's ok because i made some diferents thing before i choose law . so i just to improve myself in law , which is already hard but more easier than if i have all academic subject .
