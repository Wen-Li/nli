i totally agree with this sentence . attracting a new client is the base of advertising and in a wider meaning of marketing technique . i graduated in marketing two year ago and the first thing i have been taught during my lesson is that , a a future manager , i would have had to sell the idea of a product not the product itself . this statement , that might sound quite absurd at first sight , ha turned out to be very useful in my job . the main reason to support this concept is that a customer , when get in touch with a product , doe not act in a rational way . many research based on customer purchase have clearly demonstrated that the customer wa n't sure of his choice after a few step he had made out of the shop . this example clarifies how it 's not important what a person think about a product after she ha bought it . the producer must focus his attention on what a customer want to find in the product . if a person in charge of a marketing department of a company fails to do this , he 'd hardly be able to sell the product . moreover , a the range of possible item is constantly increasing , advertisement help the customer to do his/her first choice . if a product show many possible upside from it use and multiple possible utilisation it will attract a person for sure . the more you exagerate in showing an item , the more you will catch the attention on it . of course , this doe n't always work becouse you will always find a segmented target aware of the fact that you are probably hiding something . to sum up , i would say that advertising is an art . something you can not learn . something innate through which you lead people to buy everything you want , but . .. something that can improve a product only in the fantasy of a consumer not in reality .
