i do not agree with the statement . i think that one first need to specialize in something . then , after this is achieved , one can interchange idea with people who have other specialization . of course i do believe that while sepecializing in some subjet , one ha to keep in mind which is the place of the subjet among the rest of the other subject . and in this sense i think it is very important to have a broad knowledge of subject . of course this knowledge will not be deep , but just an idea of the important issue of each area . i think that in the last 50 year scientific knowledge ha grown in such a way that it is impossible for anybody to dominate all the branch of science . this may could have happend in the past , where the entire human knowledge wa smaller . but this is no longer the case . so i think it is not sensible to intend to have a full and deep knowledge of all or many subject . another related point is the laboral issue . i think that someone who ha specialized will have greater job opportunity than someone who ha a broad knowledge but ha no specific specialization . at least when i read for job opportunites , all job proposal ask for specific proffessions or specialization . i also realize this with my friend . those who have gotten the better job are those who have specialized in something .
