i agree with the statement given . because it is important to teach the student to understant what they are being tough . there is an old chinesse saying that ; if you want to save somebody from his or her hunger , you have to teach him or her to how to hunt instead of giving him or her ; a fish to feed with . if a student or a child doe not understants the idea or the concept that are being tough to them they will simply memorize the subject but not learn from it . some school system or training program are build on the student or the attendent to memorize what is being given to them which doe kill their imagination and doe not prepare them to life . for example couse and effect can be tough to a student in a science class and most of the childeren if not interested specificlly will not enjoy the science class a a social science student i hate it . if a child doe not understant the reason of a couse and effect situation she or he will not use it to understand people reaction about her or his action . if a science teacher teach you the couse and effect principal via giving you example of your ordinary life , example of what you do dailly action you will understand what you learn . if not just make it an experiment in a lab class you wont remember it until the examination time and after that never . when you memorize something it is a great risk fort you to forget it . and it will happen because our brain are like computer . as we do to make our computer when it is full wiht information and becasue of that it speed slows and doe not work more effectively . we must delete some old information to get new one . and the first information it will delete will be the one you do not remember or do not understand why it happens , the one it is put in without any meaning . if teacher and parent are the one that shape our personality and future they must be very carefull to teach the young mind with a great hunger how to fish not to give u a fish just for once .
