there are different way of traveling , and they are all determined by the traveler 's specific interest . in my experience , the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide limit the option of the traveler forcing him to follow a pre-set itinerary of activity , some of his interest and some he probably wo n't enjoy . traveling in a large group , will imply not only to follow the itinerary but the pace of the group . the idea of traveling should be to experience a much of the new place , people and their culture a possible . furthermore , it should provide personal enjoyment to who is travelling . in our everyday life we have to comply with schedule and rule , when we are on vacation we should take advantage of this unique opportunity of having complete control and determine by ourselves how we want to spend our time . by doing this we will release stress and tension , feel challenged and invigorated with the adventure that leaving our daily routine and comfort zone represent . there should n't be limitation , the advancement of communication , technology and the availability of information make simple to create a tailored trip for any taste , with the freedom of adjusting it a we go . it is important to involve people from the area when possible , specially when traveling to a foreign country where we are not used to the language and more importantly to theculture . it is also recommendable to research and prepare a tentative list of activity prior to the trip to avoid spending valuable time once we are abroad . a small group of friend and your own itinerary should be the best way to travel , by doing this we will enjoy a new experience with people that share similar interest and at the same time will break our daily routine by being completely free to choose exactly what we want to do .
