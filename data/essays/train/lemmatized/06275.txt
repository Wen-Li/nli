there are two common way to travel now . one is travelling in a group led by a tour guid ; the other one is going by oneself . they both have their own advantage . the choice might depend on traveler ' own ability and personality . i know travelling with a group and a tour guide ha been mostly accepted by people . people who chose this way are likely travel to the place with long historical or curtural back ground like china europe without the knowledge about them , so they need a guide . they may have no special need such a the diet of food , the room condiction , the schedule of planing or staying at one place they most like for more time . moreover , traveling with a group will help people , especially lazy one , to get rid of booking the hotel , finding some where to have meal or even which place they should go . compare with the way above , a a person with more personality and need , i reather to travel by myself or with my best friend . firstly , i think the most interesting step of a whole journey is not staying at the place you travel to but the process of planning for the whole trip . imagine that you can sit arround a table with hot coffe , think of how lovely the period of the trip will be and discus or argue with your friend about where you guy should go . that 's very attractive to me . secondly , i love natural view more than historical building , so i can totally go to a place that doe n't need be far , dones n't need a guide there or even doe n't have a name . i can enjoy the view and take picture of that , and share thatwith my friend . i can stay a long a i wish to and go anywhere i like for my next station . without feeling hurry , without feeling being contraled , the two word in my mind are relaxation and freedom . that is the meaning of travel , is n't it ?
