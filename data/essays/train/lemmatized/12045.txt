in marketing , the tool that are used to convince the costumer to by the product are various . some of these tool , like sample , are honest , and give a true idea about the product , while other tool , like advertisement , may sometimes give a false image about the product , and we find that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , which is logical because the mission of such advertisement is to make the consumer prefer this product to other competitor . advertisement is an art , but i cnsider it a little far from honesty . so , in any advertisement , the conclusion is that this product is the best among it all other competitor , which ca n't be true for more than one product . this applies especially when the product is a service , like a company that advertise for a one-week trip , with all it detail , the customer see the adv . and decides to believe it , so he take the trip with this company , then he discovers that everything which wa described in their brochure is just so away to be fact , and they planned the trip just to be with the least cost `` for them '' . the problem that within the adv. , they include some phrase or condition that protects them legally . i believe that most of the people realize the fact of advertisement now , and to be fair there are certain product that are beyond any adv. , and people know these produts , in which case they do n't need to be advertised , but with other product and advertisement , people must be careful and catious so that they do n't get decieved by advertisement .
