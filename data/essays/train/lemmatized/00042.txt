do young people enjoy life more than older people ? i believe the answer is `` no '' . i believe both young and older people can enjoy their life equally , however , the way of enjoying the life are quite different . young people tend to enjoy their life from activies which older people can not handle very well . for example , young people like to party alot . they drink , dance , and hang out with their friend all night long . this is one way of young people to appriciate their healthest time in their life . also , some other young people like to play sport , game , and music . for example , i am in a band and i play guitar . i love to play my guitar with my band . we `` rock and roll '' with music we play . on the other hand , older people enjoy life by walking a park , hiking , or chatting with their friend . as i observe my grandparent it seems like older people enjoy beautiful environment such a sound of a bird or color of the sky . they take the advantage of the environment to the fullest . oider people appriciate the beautiful mother nature that god ha created for human . also , they enjoy their company . older people can not do extreme activity like young people do ; they have a little enjoyable conversation with their friend . as i decribed the difference in way that young people enjoy life and older people enjoy life through specific example , i believe anybody can enjoy life regardless of age . the `` age '' is just a number . it is very rude and disrepectful to think `` oh . .. because they are old , they ca n't have fun . '' older people have already enjoyed their life like young people 30 year ago . in conclusion , i strongly disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . are n't you going to enjoy your life when you are older ?
