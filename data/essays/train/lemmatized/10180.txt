having a broader knowlege of many academic subject help a person to have a wider information of the thing present in the vast world that he is life in . it keep him aware of the fact and help him deal with problem with a wider perspection . on the contrary , specializing in one subject on a particular area keep him localized and make him narrow minded . furthermore , it make him lose the self confidence while dealing with situation that come to him unexpectedly . he feel enclosed and lost in this world of variety . for instance , i have a friend whose mother is a teacher and ha studied history , geography and english . when i see her deal with the problem related any of these field with complete easiness , it make me feel that she is very confident of herself in whatever she doe . while i also know another teacher who ha specialized in biology and ha confined herself to the world of biology alone . i completely agreethat it defintely is a difficult task studying a specific subject alone and specializing in it , however the advantage my friend 's mother ha over her is obviously more in number . receiving a broad knowledge on a variety of topic doe not mean specializing in it on studying for it . it can also be achieved by mere reading . this is one reason why we are adviced to read newspaper . it help u keep ourselves up dated with the incident happening around u in this world . reading book or magazine or any piece of article for that matter doea not go vain . schools and college also include a variety of subject for the student in their academic program in order to make them self confident and train them to face the hardship and obstacle they will come across in their future life . i stongly feel that having a broader knowledge of many academic subject is definitely more advantageous than the specializing in only one subject . it make a person strong and help him live in this challenging world with full confidence .
