some people have broab knowledge of many academic subject , which mean that they know little on many many different thing , some others know a lot about only a few subject , which mean that they 're specialized in those subject . what is the best ? as far a i 'm concerned , i really believe that student should touch a little bit evrerything , they should be in the know , not only about the different subject they have in class , but also about what happens in the outside world of their university . i think that if somebody ha a broad knowledge of many academic subject it show it mind-openess and it interrest for what others learn and study . nevertheless , if you know little about many different thing you can take part on a lot of conversation , but a soon a it get to the core of the matter you get lost , given that it will be to specific for you and you wo n't be able to answer question . on the other hand , if you know a lot about only a few subject you can depen conversation on those you know but you ca n't even take part at conversation which deal about something you may never have heard about , or you can ask but the other peolple may look at you a if you where from another planet . that is the risk you undertake . so to resume my opinion , i think that there ha a balance to be found between having a broad knowledge on many different academic subject and beeing specialized in only one . that mean that one should be open-minded and have a lot of different point of interest but in the same time that one should know everything in an exact way about one or maximum two specific subject .
