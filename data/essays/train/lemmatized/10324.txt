i agree the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . it is certainly true that taking risk sometimes scare person and make hesitate to doing something new . however , i have seen people who get to succeed due to taking risk in thire life . first of all , it is often said that high risk make high return . my father-in law invest the almost of his saving and posetions on bigining a new bussines when he wa in mid twenty . it is really challneging incident . he resighed the company he worked a a employee . it meaned he lost his stable and countinus income . if the invest wa failed , it is difficult to live form tommorrow . he could not afford his wife and child at that time . however , he 's bussiness wa succeed and he earn much money than before . he could make his child to take a good education and he is living without financial worry now . secondly , this is not such a successful story but may be my trivial experience . i tend to try new thing always . for example , i often go to the new restaurant to seek the new receip and taste . sometimes it end to fail because new taste wa not suitable for my favourite . however , i feel very excited when i looking for new rentaurant and this proccess make me happy . i lrealized from my experience that seeking for something new make people happy and excited . i think that this is essential and important atittude to lead success in one 's life . finnaly , i think that it is boring only to do what they already know how to deal with . it would make your everyday life routine work . we feel excited only when we have some stimulates from new thing . from avove three reason , i definitly agree the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
