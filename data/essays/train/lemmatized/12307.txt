as car are partly responsible for pollution and global warming , it ha become a big issue that the number of car in use is always increasing . will our government be able to restrain the number of car so that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use ? it seems to me that this is not going to happen soon . first of all , the world population is increasing , why would the number of car decrease in a short-term future ? nowadays , developping country are developping more quickly than ever before . and they will soon have the same demand for car a developped country , where nearly each one in the family owns a car . on top of that , car constructor are providing developping country with car that correspond to their standard of life , so a to be able to earn money from the market in developping country . then , we could also think that when there is no more oil to power the car , the number of car will decrease . well , that may happen for a time , but those car will quickly be replaced by car promoted by sustainable development , and powered by clean or renewable energy , which will be a performant and a accessible to everyone a the oiled-powered car . however , i think this increase in the number of car wo n't last for ever . as a matter of fact , i am convinced that with the help of the government , the number of car will reach a kind of limit , based on a policy to restrain the number of car and a balance between the use of car and the use of mean of mass transport . otherwise , and increasing number of car will not fit in the city ' traffic . to sum up , i think that twenty year from today , there will be more car , but this phenomenon is not gonna last for a long time .
