i do not agree with the idea that successful people are the one that try new thing and take risk , instead of only doing what they already know how to do well . there are several reason that make me not agree with this statement , but i would like to concentrate in three of them . firstly , i do not believe that been a risk taker or an innovative person is a necessary condition to achieve success in life or your professional field . in fact , every aspect of life ( interpersonal relation , family , labor relation , religion , social life ) and academic discipline , or professional field , require a different approach to succesffully interact and solve problem . secondly , taking risk might lead to failure . even though failing is not always negative , it represents an interruption on a task or process , which certainly cause delay on accomplishing a project 's goal or task . thus , incurring in activity or behavior that involve high chance to fail will definetely not lead to success . lastly , it is important to considering that in fact , doing the same thing lead you to specialization , which will make you an expert on doing something or in a specific field and probably a successful and well-known person in that particular area . opposite , it is really difficult for someone to do something new or an invention if he or she doe not know the object or field . this mean that people require certain amount of knowledge and familiarity with a field or object to actually make a new thing that will deliver personal success . i believe that the key to success is not hidden behind being the most original or risk taking person , but to actually get to know what you do . going deep into one activity , dealing with it in a daily basis will allow someone to achieve success .
