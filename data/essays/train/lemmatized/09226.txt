everyday in our life we can see product ' advertisement and spot almost everywhere we go . they are specifically studied to attract u , to steal our attention , thus making u think about them even for few second , even if we do n't need what they are advertising . to do so they have to be direct , colorful , funny . everything they are advertising must appear beautifull , amazing , of great use or even really tastefull . so yes , i basically agree with the statement , and we can often have evidence of it . for example - a really common one - we see on tv or on a paper something advertising something to eat , it seems wonderfull , hot , tasty and it also ha a low price ! i have at least to try it . when we go to buy it , we can see it is half the size it seemed and it is not even that tasty . advertisements can influence a lot your thought . not to talk about kid . if they see a toy on tv , it 's shown colorfull and huge . they need to buy it . what i said work the best with food , toy , something uncommon or that we do n't usually see . items used in our everyday life can not be shown to much better than they are , because we know them , we know how they work and what they can and can not do . the base idea to advertise something is to make it appear fantastic . if you want to sell it it must appear fantastic . to do so it can seem even better than it is .
