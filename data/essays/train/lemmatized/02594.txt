i do believe successful people try new thing and take risk . i believe life is full of opportunity that can benefit u , but we have to be ready and willing to accept this opportunity . if a person just sits around and keep doing the same than his/her life will become in a rutine . risks are always good because they motivate the person and make a person give it 's best to achieve it 's personal goal , it 's always good to try new thing . a person ha to look at it in a way that if nothing come out of this than it not a lost , it actually a win , because you earned experience . experience is a very valuable gift a person acquires over time . nobody is born with experience , life give a person the experience required to become successful and not fail . successful people have already obtained a certain degree of experience that ha taken them to the spot they are located at . a good example of how experience help and is acquaired would be that a guy recently graduated with a business major , would n't be able to run a company by itself . he probably ha the knowledge , but not the experience to know what to do , or what decision he need to take , or how the company is run . important personality in life have taken risk . one good example is cristopher columbus . he took the risk of sailing through the ocean , because he had a dream that the earth wa round , and not flat like everybody said it wa . he took that risk and he had a great outcome , he found america . if he would sat around and just believed what everybody else wa believing in and just traveling in the same route everybody wa , than he would n't have never found the glory he found when he decided to take that risk . life is full of risk , and we have to be well prepared in order to confront them , and when they come we do n't have to be afraid of taking them because we do n't know what we might found or the outcome of them will be . a person wont become successful just wishing and dreaming they were successful , what they need to do is get up and go out and overcome all type of adversity .
