i strongly agree with this statement : it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i have strong experiene that can support the reason of my opinion . i agree of this statement because of two reason below . first , without processing of understanding , we can not say that we know fact . when i wa a high school student , there is the teacher who famous for hasitating for student 's question . he tought national history , he always tought u a book say like copy the book . when i questioned about this subject , i could not satisfy of his answer . he seems to do not know well about his subject , and i do not think he understand perfectly of his subject . he just knew and tought only fact . espetially the national history class requires `` understanding '' , not `` fact '' , because of him , i still do not know about my conutry 's history entirely . second , there is a virtue that `` knowing one , knowing ten '' it mean when we understand one thing perfectly , we can know nine thing related with it additionaly . few day ago , my one of friend asked me about concept of market . i answered to her a i learned from book , and she also knew that concept . but she need to know it profoundly . so we started to study about it researching internet , reading book related with it . eventually we could understand perfectly , a understanding it , i can understand till another concept of marketing easily . because of two reason , i agree with this statement : it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than ut u for them to learn fact . thesedays , we can learn about everything easily through the internet . we need attitude that think about one thing deeply rather than passing with just it fact .
