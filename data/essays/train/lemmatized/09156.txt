the issue at hand is whether there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than today . the question is very interesting since the number of car used have a tremendous influence on our environment because of the pollution . i personally believe that there will be more car in use in twenty year than today . the first reason i think this is because the number of people who can afford a car is constantly growing . although we do n't know how the economical structure will look like in twenty year we have to expect that in the big country like china and india more people will earn enough money to buy a car for their personal need . another reason why i assume that more car will be on the road is based on the assumption that the people 's search for individualism is constantly growing . many people do n't want to be limited by public transportation to get to their destination . they use their car to travel whenever they want to the place they would like to be . they 're not limited by timetable or the location of the train/bus station . my final thought which support my opinion is that car are also a sign of wealth . in contrast to the people who can afford one car for their personal transportation there will be many people who earn enough money to have even more than one car and that only for the purpose of fun . there are a lot of couple without child who have 3 car . one car for each person for the daily use and the third car , for example a sport car or a convertrible car , for special occasion . there are also a lot of collector of very old car , called oldtimer . concluding the argument above i can say that we should definitely expect more car on the road in twenty year than today .
