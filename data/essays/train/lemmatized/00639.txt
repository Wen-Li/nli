the number of car on our planet is a very important problem but we are moving on the right direction and i think in the next twenty year will be fewer car in use than there are today . the first point to support this opinion is that the oil is going to finish in not a long time and still now there are n't other tecnology a efficent for car . therefore to use car will be more expensive and le people would pay for that . another point is the air pollution caused by car . infact the environment is damnaged by car and to solve this problem the solution is to reduce the number of car on the earth . finally the pubblic tranports are becoming more efficent and there are a lot of project to construct new metropolitan line , railway station and to increase the number of bus , so iwill be more easy and fast to use pubblic transport . also the flight by plane are going to become more cheaper in the next twenty year and they will to cover more short distance line , so an increasing number of people are going to use often the plane instead than car . to conclude i think in twenty year there will be fewer car in car than today
