working with group is one of the best way to improve the community . because every body can give some idea that they can help each other . i disagree with theese young people . we must find time for this point , because i think it a shame on u if we dont help the other with ouer idea . mabe some young people think that their own work from learning or buseniss is more important than help the other . but i think it nessesery from them to programe they time to not mix bitween this and that . they also will take many good thing from advice and encourages from the other people , and sure that will help them in they owen work . finally , i want to advice every young people to be with their community and help them , because it a good manar from them . and absoloutly they will got meny usefui thing in their life .
