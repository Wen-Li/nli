i do totally agree with the statement . for me , there is nothing more important than understanding idea and concept . it 's a shame that most school-systems concentrate more on learning by hard then understanding idea . the school missed all important achievement of the last 50 year . they focus on learning fact , not on understanding fact . in my eye , it 's possible to pas school only by learning fact without understanding them . even in universtity , in several subject , for example in some economic-subjects , it 's possible to get along with learning fact . but for university you shoud fullfill other requirement . if you try to pas live only by learning fact , you have the wrong point of view . you can not repeat fact all the time , once in your live you have to come to the point where you understand the link between several topic and where you are able to produce your own idea . on the other hand you can not achiev anything only by understanding idea and concept . once understood , you have to learn several thing by hard . the best example is to learn a language . you can understand all the grammar - but without vocabulary you wo n't be able to have a conversation in this language . i know a lot of smart student who are able to understand idea very fast . but when they understood the idea , the do not think about them anymore , they do n't learn them by hard , and , a fast a they understood the idea , they forget them . it 's a waste of talent , they do not recognize that you have to work hard for good result . they are not used to . and , no matter of my opinion , i did also realize how important it is to learn fact , and how difficult it is . but learning fact must never be the more important point of study . for only learning fact , we do n't need human beeings , computer are better in storing information without thinking of it . as long a we think of the fact we learn , we learn the right way , the way you need to learn to be a good student .
