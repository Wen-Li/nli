in my opinion , in the near future le car will be used compared to what is used today . several reason can contribute to having this opinion . i think the technological advance that are going on in othe transportation vehicle will decrease the number of car being used . for example . trains in japan and germany are becoming very fast and i think in the futute they will compensate for the time it take to reach to the train station . goverments will announce new law prohibiting a single person to use a car . already in certain city , only car with more than one passenger are allowed to use the fastest lane . this , to encourage people to travel in group . the reasonable development of such law is that statement mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph . home will be the center of all activity is another reason i would like to mention . nowadays , many people work at home . all the needed entertainment can become available at home . morever , food , from restaurant and grocery shop , is being delivered up to your door . car model are becoming very similar in appearance and option . a very good example is the honda accord and hyundi sonata , it is hard to differentiate between them form outside . at the end , this will lead to only one company selling car . cars will have le appeal to rich people and they will stop buying car and start buying hovercraft vehicle or any other transporation device . in conclusion , car will become dispensible a le car will be in use . hopefully , instant travel , which we read about in science fiction novel , will be invented in the next twenty year .
