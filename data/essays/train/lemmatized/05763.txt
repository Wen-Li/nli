the issue at hand is whether advertisement make product seem better than they really are or not . this is a very important issue , because advertisement have a great influence on our every day life . in my opinion advertisments assume product to be better than they really are . for this i have several reason . the first is that i experienced how advertisement can lie in my own life . i saw a new hair shampoo at the tv , which should make my hair more shiny and easier to form . because of this advertisment i went to the shop and bought the shampoo . maybe my hair wa shinier after using the shampoo , but it wa not easy to model it at all . in reality it wa even more difficult . this is one of the example which made me casting doubt on advertisement . now i always question what is shown . another reason is that i compare what i see in the advertisement with the thing i can buy at the shop . through this it is obvious that the advertisments are lie . everything look so colorful at the tv but in reality it is not colorful at all . it is just like every other product you can buy in the shop , which is not advertised . finally , one can sometimes see how advertisement are produced . that completely convinces one that advertisments make product seeming better than they are . take for example some sort of food . when people want to advertise such product they have special strategy for it . the most interesting is that most time the food is not real . advertisers just put it together with artificial material . so it look better and you just want to buy it . you will never find product in advertisments in their original way . that is a big lie to the customer , is it not ? to sum up , i think that advertisement make product better than they really are because of my own experience , compare between advertised product and the actual product in the shop and because of the way advertisement are produced .
