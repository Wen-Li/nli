`` exploring by yourself or leading by someone ? '' it is a personal choice depends on a person 's character and goal because of this people make different decision to explore or learn somewhere . despite leading by a tour guide , i prefer to explore place and prepare my own travel guide by myself because it cost le money and i might explore more thing . getting a service is always expensive than doing these thing by yourselves so making your own travel guide is cheaper . first of all , you can save money if you travel by yourselves because you decide what you are going to do on travel and you do n't have to pay for this decision . tour guide provide information about travel and place where you want to go but you can find those information spending a littile bit time on internet . also , tour guide generally guide you to some place where they can get more money for accomodation or shopping so they might cost more than they really are . finally , tour guide always deceive you to spend more money but if you travel by yourselves you could control yourselves to spend your money . for example , tour guide give some option which are really look like fascinating but not important such a staying at a five star hotel it is really essantial for travel ? tour guide just show place where are on their list and this list generally limited . first of all , they lead tour group to only basic place so if you are in a tour group you might miss wonderful other place . for example , when i first came to chicago , i have paid money to a tour guide to show me real chicago but i just saw millenium park and sears . after a while i discover other wonderful place in chicago where are rush st. hancock tower . as they said `` everthing is in detail '' so people could find a lot of detail place if they search for their travel . a lot of people prefer a tour guide to travel in a group , however , i prefer to explore place by myself and be my own tour guide because i can save money and i can see more place .
