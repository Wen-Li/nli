successful people do not have to try new thing if they are satisfied their succeed . they should improve their successful job rather than try totally new thing . of course , they can try new thing but there is no promise to get success again . i assume that people could have got success is not so careful to try new job because they have confidence from their success . they do not have any pressere in bad way . they feel that they can do everything they want and get succeess . i will not stop them if they have really good idea for their project or their project have some similar point which they had , or they are quite sure they can get successful . acutually , they know how to get succeess and what would be able to go well or bad . this is their own problem so i should not stop or disturb them . however , from my perspective , they should not do that because we really can not get success so often . concentrating to one thing is more effective than trying a lot of thing . if they have a lot of categolies to do , they would be so busy and each thing can be too simple because they have no time to think about each shop . for example , there is a bos who ha macdonald 's and h & m . if h & m is very popular and they can get a lot of money from it , who think about a new barger of macdonald 's ? the bos would think about h & m all the time and they do not really think about macdonald 's . of course they can get money from macdonald 's but the shop would not be better . for these reason , i do not think successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . they can be a professional people of that .
