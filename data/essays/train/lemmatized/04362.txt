learning is an important and difficult issue for student . first they have to understant what they should learn . some people claim that learning idea and concept are very significant and some other people agree that learning fact is exactly much more essential . i agree that learning idea and concept are much more important than learning fact in term of forming more creative and responsive indiviuals . as i mentioned above learning idea and comcepts should become prior for student because major aim of the learning is educating himself and increasing the information to make some sort of comparison or to come up with result or new idea . therefore , learning fact is impossible for student and anyone , they have to create and form their own fact by combining the idea and concept that they learn . for instance , student can learn the idea that lie under a war in the history such a world war ii . they should learn the idea and concept that lead that war to occur , however , they should anlyze and realize the consequence of world war ii to understand and learn the fact . another important point is that , by teaching them the fact themselves , teacher prevent student improvement duration . students can improve themselves by thinking on a subject that they learn the major idea , they will become more creative and more observer and that characteristic obviosly help them during their life time . if a nation want to raise an individually working , observing and creating indiviuals they let them to learn the major idea and concept . to sum up some people claim that student should understand idea and concept and some people claim that they have to learn the fact . both condition have some advantage and drawback , however , i agree that student should understand the idea and concept . this is their priority , by the help of that type of learning they will become more observer and more creative because they merge their own fact .
