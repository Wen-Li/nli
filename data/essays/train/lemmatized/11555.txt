i strongly agree with the statement that that successful people try new thing and take risk . it is very difficult for any person to be satisfied with his or her achievments . moreover if a person is successful and ha mean to try something new he will never hesitate . it is a human nature to desire more that what he ha . it is said that if a glass is half filled and half empty one should be satisfied with the portion full with water . but it is never seen . a person always want to touch new horizon of success . for an example if company becomes the topmost business of a country the owner will try his best to make it the most successful business of the world . rather this will act a a driving force and he will be ready to take any risk for it . if a person is successful and ha enough cash and credit he will be more inclined to take risk and explore new area of bussiness . he can start a new work with a small portion and in case he would not secceed he will not lose much and still have enough from the old bussiness . moreover a person who ha proved him self in the market ha gained respect and faith of many people , so others are always ready to help ficancially or by other mean . this is not true only in the business world . world is full of such example . there are many scientist , artist , mountain clinbers , and many more other people who did not stop after being successful and earning reputation and money . rather have always tried to do more that what they did till now . in sum i think that sucess act a a driving force making a person want more and more and a successful person ha tha advantage of having more support and resource so he can take more risk to achieve more .
