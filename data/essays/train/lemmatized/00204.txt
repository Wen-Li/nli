i think that a general knowledge of many academic subject is the best way to understand which will be my future work . i believe in this because of my last and still coming on the surface doubt about `` what i will be in the future '' . infact if you would be listening to my telephone call or discussion with my mother in the last time , for estance , you would discover me speaking rightly about this . i think in this period of the life , almost everybody ha already decided what to do so this is why people decide to attend specialized course , and to take part to lesson on specific subject . if your interest is so specific and you are sure about what are your passion and love , you should n't waste your time and pick up specialized subject study . but not for all the people , thing are clear . .. this is my case , i have n't nearly a clue of i surely will be , or in which envoironment i would like to work in , maybe turism business ? maybe in the army ? is working in a bank the right choice ? ... ... i really do n't think so ! an this is why i really trust in what i stated . an other problem is that the decision , applying the question on which the essay is based , on college choosing period of our life , an other factor come inside : time go on . having the possibility to have more life i would surely try both approach , attending specializing course and lesson on a subject or few of them , then trying to find my way through , also having a broad knowledge of many acadamic subject . my answer , so my solution to the question , could not be so clear after what i 'm going to state right now , but , reading what i have just wrote above this final line , you will be able to understand my vision : if we have already decided what we are going to do in the future we must `` carpediem '' ( so take time by the hair ) , and pick a specializing academic path . but if we are not sure or we think our idea will change , taking part to the study of many academic knowledge is the better decision . referring to the question `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' the first will be a more flexible choice then the second one .
