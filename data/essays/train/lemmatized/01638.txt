i do agree to the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' in many way here are the some young people can enjoy their school and campus life more than anything else , since they dont have any responsibility like leading a family , taking care of the office work , managing finacial status an so on a the older people have . more over older people have to struggle all the day and then they dont have any time to spend with their family . but the young people can enjoy thier campus life all the day and then they have time to spend with their family . for example : i have seen my servent working all the day at different house to earn some money for her child . she help her child in buying any item which they ask her . in this example you have seen that younger people are enjoying and getiing what they need in life but the older people are working all the day . of course my servent feel happy in buying a gift or any thing their child want . once if any one get married in his/her life that might be the end to enjoying because i have seen many people changing their attitude or working even more harder than used to before , more responsibility come into place and they dont have time to enjoy . most the young people can enjoy their life because they dont have any worry or tension in their . young people can do what ever they like to do but the older people cant do because they have to think a lot before taking any decision . i conclude that `` young people enjoy a lot more than the older people '' a i explained above with example aand reason .
