having le car in twenty year time doe not seem to be possible due to several reason : comfort of the car , availability of a technolgy and global reason . as the child of the twentied century we were born with car , live and grow with them . we have so much famaliar and used to them . we can not find comfort of these car in any of vehicle , bicycle or motorcycle or a ship or train non of those can provide the comfort and service we used to hava with our car . secondly , the technology is not available to make an vehicle that can compute with car . space ship , plane or helicopter they may have seem to compute with car but it should also be taken into account that they cost too much that ordinary people can afford . or even they can afford them some time where they will park their helicopter or where they will land with their plane . it is a big question mark and doe not seems to be realistic . the last but the most important one is the global reason . the big car producing company will not let a change in current status of the car by making big cut from price . not only the car producer but also oil company do not want fewer car in use a their profit will decrease with le gasoline sale . the same reason can be taken for oil - exporter country and or for the country who make too much money from petroleum sector such a usa , russia , and middle east country that determines and effect the political and economical decision all over the world . in conclusion , in twenty year , there will not be fewer car in use than today a we get used to the comfort of our car which we can buy by le money than other vehicle provided with the current technolgy . and the global power will not let a change in the situtation in unfavourably of them a a result of change in oil sector .
