in the learning phase student will come across many subject wich are useful in his feature , so some body think that these unnessary subject included in the education few student are facing some difficulty but this not true , for suvival of present situation there is a need to come across variety topic . in the graduation program an student will take only few subject for the specilisation purpose for example , for the specilgaton power system stability in master of sceience in electrical engineering , for these specilisation there is lot of math i required , for doing project also we requre lot fundamental in other subject also . including the diffirent topic in education is also problem to the student , due to incrising the subject the mental stress also incrises , due to this additional burden he may not concentrated on hisintrsed fied of subject . by simply learning few subject is actually not sufficient for higher study while the phase burden wa incriseeing on the student keep in mind these effect on the situation the governament will plan for the requirments . so finally my openion is knowledge on subejects is depends on the level of study , up to undergratuation level it is better to have brod knowledge of many academic subject and in gradutation level it is better to have brod knowledge on any one speciligation .
