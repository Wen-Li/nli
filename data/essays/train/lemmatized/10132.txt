with the swift and tremendous development of industry , people are making every effort to enjoy life . in the mean time , the industrial growth also brings huge damage to human living condition . the air pollution produced by over use of vehicle is a warn that people should cut down on the application of them , which lead me to believe that in 20 year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to begin with , the abuse of car ha caused severe environmental issue . many people have been in possession of car for quite a long time . they travel by car , go to work in a car , and even discus commercial transaction in the moving status since it is an efficient way to promote the dealing . however , it is commonly realized that gasoline consumption may lead to undoubtedly serious environmental problem including but not limited to air pollution and infectious disease concerning lung function . the gas emitted by the engine is a detriment to human living surroudings , which can damage human lung , limiting the function of breathing to carry adequate oxygen to every part of huamn body . on the other hand , such emitted gas can drift in the air for a long time possibly becoming the excellent medium for the growth of bacteria . furthermore , nowadays , more and more people are wary of the problem caused by car . people , aiming at sustainable development , are undergoing a lot of measure to control the damage . scientists are conducting experiment to evaluate the result of car produced gas . service worker are promulgating the latest or maybe recent finding of them to guide people in a correct direction -- decrease the use of car . people can also enhance their health by other alternative of car . they may practise their strength and endurabililty by riding or running in stead of driving . in this way , people force themselves to use their own muscle and energy which is a both economic and effective way to improve their health and weight loss , a popular issue , may also be realized . in a word , in my view , use of car will become le and le in 20 year in that it result in rigid environmental damage , and people may become healthier by abandoning car despite that car without gasoline consumption may be produced out in a mass since the use of car may increase human weight , causing a lot of problem relating to blood pressure and heart function .
