yes i completely agree with this fact that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the world is progressing towards the scientific world in which there might be a possilbility that there will be invention of some other alternative which will replace the present day car to some extent . as we all know that in big city there is big problem of space . now why space is a required ? the answer is in big city due to large population one requires space in which he can have his living and other thing safely placed ; what we call it a house , also if one is owning a house he will own a car and due to limitation of space one ha to accomdate both his house a well a car . also big city have big shopping mall where lot of people come to shop and to have some kind of entertainment . and there come the problem of parking of the car . at present every big city is facing the problem of parking , so twenty year from now the problem will get worsen . so the solution to this problem will be person will limit the use of car . also the problem of traffic is there in big city , car require a large space to move on the road a compared to two-wheeler vehicle . one of the problem that today big citiy is facing is of traffic due to large number of car in the city . also petrol will going to get exhausted after 30 year from now and the major requirement for a car is fuel . also some research is going on about the alternative of the fuel but it is still in the developing stage no one ha assured uptill today that the solution to the fuel problem is overcome . the technology is improving day by day and there is a possibility that very soon our scientist will devise such a equipment which will require le space and will have some alternative option for it functioning and will not require a fuel which is likely to extinguish . so i conclude that by taking in to consideration the above stated problem , in my view there is a possibility that people will use fewer car in future .
