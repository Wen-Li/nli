whether the amount of car will be smaller in twenty year time is almsost unpredictable . the reason is that such matter highly depend on the political and socio-cultural mood of the time . the answer also shift according to the part of the world one is talking about . the number of car might fluctuate in completely different way depending upon whether one is talking about developed or developing country . this essay therefore take different turn depending on the different scenario and country that are being discus and based on the knowledge of fact available today . i will now concentrate on the developed country such a the united kingdom or the united states . within the next twenty year , or even within the next decade , it will be impossible to deny the strength of the argument that the environmental lobby and personality such a al gore have been putting forward . i believe it is slowly becoming clearer that the enromous amount of greenhouse gas found in the atmosphere are largely caused by human action and will have potentially disastrous effect on the environment . i believe that there will come a time when car will not run on petroleum anymore , but on alternative energy . that might not reduce the number of car , but it will reduce the effect that car have on the environment . another possibility , is that state will invest more in public transportation . if that were the case , the amount of car might reduce by a good amount . the amount of car in developing and thirld world country such a most country in africa , will hopefully and in my opinion be higher in twenty year time . it is my belief that a substantial car industry and a high amount of car per family are indication of flourishing economy . the ratio of car per family is much higher in developed country than in developing one . thus if thirld world coutnries manage to get a grip on their economy and safety , the number of car are likely to raise .
