young people often wonder about their future , questioning if they will be happier when they get old . in general , older people life happier life than the young . first point that i want to address is that the older people are more stable emotionally as people become mature a a human being , they would not be tempered a quickly a they used to be . we discover that it is meaningness to be agressive . for example , i hated everyone at school when i wa in middleschool . however , when i read to kill a mocking bird , a novel , i started to realize that it is wrong to hate someone with no reason second , older people life happier life by managing or overcomming their hardship easily . there are time of desperation and sadness in our life . to prevail frustration is very important to avoid depression and anger , but young people usally doe not have ability to do so . statistics conducted on 2006 showed that there were average thirty student for a day who committed sucide because of their academic pressure . it is relatively bigger average rate than of adult , while it is not ture that student bare more stress than adult . the last thing i have discovered is that older people appreciates thing in their life more . my grandmother know how to appreciate small thing in her life such a sunshine , food , and house ; it seems that she get happy every moment in her life . in contrast , young people tend to be careless and negative . they say `` cool '' only when there is a really nice thing . in conclusion , older people tend to have happier life . by mangaging frustration , emotional stability , and appreciation of life able them to be happy in every aspect of life .
