i agree with the statement that the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in our day the company have a lot of possibility to show the customer all the benefit of their product . the can make advertisement in tv , radio , in the newspaper , in the internet , etc . every potential customer , that actually mean every person is confronted with a variety of advertisement every day . but not only the place where an advertisement is made is important . also the kind of advertisement . that mean that there are a lot of visual and auditional possibility to provide a company ' product . for example they can use a lot of colour and voice to create new wish or dream for the customer . and most of the time the company only show u the benefit of their product . they do n't explain u the negative aspect or some possible problem we could get with the product . with all the possibility of marketing the company have , it 's nearly impossible for the customer to see how good or bad a product really is . until he really buy and us it . this seems to be thew main problem . the customer is not able to control what the advertisement promisses without buying the product . especially the internet offeres a lot of people to provide bad product . there 're so many possibility to sell damaged or just bad product and nobody can do something against it . thus , it is very good that in germany there are some institute like `` stiftung warentest '' who test and controlls every month a few kind of different product and recommends the best of them . because of that a customer can usually be sure that a product is good or not so good .
