advertisements in the age of globalization people today face with a stark choice : trusting in advertisement or not . i argue that most advertisement make product seem better than they really are . there are two reason related to globalization : first , we live in the age of consumption culture and second , advertisement company can earn money only if they make product seem better . first , we can not deny the fact that globalization effect the whole world . a product go through different stage before it arrives to the consumer . the owner of the mean of production - the capitalist - do need subject who would consume those product . the capitalist make some arrangement with the advertisement company so that their product appeal people . to get an attractiveness , those company make product seem better . for examle , if you want to buy a watch , you may look at the advertisement and decide accordingly . you would look at the shape and the color of the watch a represented in the advertisement , and then think about it . later , you may come up with the idea that you want to buy this watch . however , if you go to a watch store , you may be very disappointed in the sense that the watch you saw on the advertisement may be very different than the one you saw in the store ! the color or the quality may change . as i mentioned before , advertisement make product seem better so that people buy it . second , since globalization ensures survival for the one who have money , an advertisement company should earn money to continue to do business . i agree with this fact , so it make sense if they make product seem better . the capitalist would choose a company which represents the product in the best possible way . so , the advertisement company would try to do their best in order to get the job . moreover , once people begin to buy item they see on the advertisement , the company would be famous and work with many other capitalist . to clarify , every capitalist would like to be in collaboration with the most popular advertisement company . to sum up , in the light of the factor i mentioned above , it can be said that advertisement company do whatever the age of globalization requires . the fact that it work through the consumption culture and it allowes a company to survive only if it earns money , advertisement make product seem better . we should keep in mind that a long a we experience globalization , we have to accept the advertisement a they are .
