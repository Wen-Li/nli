i strongly agree with specializing in one specific subject . i think each person ha a thing to do . people do not have to do all thing . if a person could do one thing very well , the person can do that noone else can do . so each person ha thing that only the person can do . to do the thing that another people can not do , specializing in one specific subject . in high school , student study many subject those are not specific . that mean they just study many academic subject . but in university , student go to university to learn about one specific subject they are interested in. of cause university is better than high school . so i think the system of the education today show that specializing in one subject is better to do . most of many academic subject we learn in high school are meanless when we get a job . once we get a job , what we need is going to be a specific thing . in the society , people do their part of the job . noone can do all part of job . so many company need people who have something specific . today , i think many people find difficult to find what they should do and want to do . the key find what to do is a specific thing . if people know any of specific subject , why do not find the job that you can use your knowledge that you learned ? i think what the world need now is specific people with specific knowledge . therefor , specific knowledge is very useful at many situation like job , at school and in your normal life . my opinion is to enjoy and make your life succusessful try to get at least one specific thing that others normaly can not do . a soon a people have many type of specific thing , world is going to increase to a new world .
