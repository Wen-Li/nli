i think there is no miracle solution to be successful but we can do the best to achieve this objective . i am totally agree with people who said that you must take many risk to plan a successful career . for example , if you want to open a restaurant , you must risk a part of your own money to have sufficient fund to buy all a restaurant need . if you do n't want to take this risk , you 'll never open your restaurant . but only take risk will not guarantee a successful career , i think you must be innovant to achieve this objective . by doing only what you can do , you 'll never progress because you do n't try to experiment a new type of work and i think successful people are in constant progress to be the most competitive in their field of activity . and if they failed in a project , they can change totally their activity because they more adaptive . so experimenting new thing is very useful to have success because the world is changing every day and it will not adapt to you , you will adapt to it . imagine a grocery which only sell apple . if apple disapear on the earth ' surface , he ha two solution . he can stop this activity or he can sell other product . that 's the reason you must adapt what you do
