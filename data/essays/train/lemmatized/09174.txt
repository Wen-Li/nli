in my opinion it is better to be specialized in one subject . the first reason for this is that nowadays it is important to be specialized . you need to be unique . when people are looking for a job it is much easier to find one if you are an expert in your area . today many people have a broad knowledge of different subject , but i think that these knowledge are unimportant and wo n't help to get a job . why i 'm thinking this ? well , most of the thing people with a broad education know are only basic to an expert . another reason why i belive that it is better to learn just one subject is that it 's much easier to concentrate on it . you start with the basic and the topic will involve more and more detail a you keep on learning about it . if you are studying many different subject instead , you only get to scratch the surface each time . i know that supporter of the statement would say that it is necessary to study many subject because today many area are linked . in their opinion somebody who ha a greater variety in academic subject is therefore able to find conculsions in complex matter . i disagree with that because i do n't think that you will learn enough to solve a complex problem linking different area all by yourself . a group of expert on the other side should't have a problem with that . also , if you 're an expert , it is not that easy to replace you . but if you 're not an expert , it 'll be easy to replace because there many people having the same knowledge . all in all , i think to be specialized ha more positive aspect than having little knowledge of different subject and should therefore be recommended to student .
