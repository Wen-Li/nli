i disagree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do becasue the following reason . to enjoy life , first thing we have to realize is how precious our life are . the life doe not have to be a special one such a celebrity 's or politician 's . the normal life itself is already special enough . without appriciate our life we never really enjoy neither youth or life . however there are many young people who seem to loose their interest in thier life . even though they are many thing from they can take advantage , such a education for all child , development of computer system , easy access to all around the world , avalability of social support and so on , they do not seem to be happy . they rather seem to take all advatages for granted or do not realize how lucky they are . one of the reason why young people lost their will to live thier life more actively is that they are not able to picturelize how they would be in ten year later . becasue of bad economy , political mess , untrustable politician , strange teacher etc. it is not easy to keep their dream and ambition for child . instead they learn the word `` that 's life '' or `` that 's the way it is '' with a feeling of giving up . so , those chirdlen grow up and become young adult who ha no vision for the future . on the other hand , even though older people is loosing their physical ability they still have will to live . especially old people who have war-experience know how to appriciate what we have . life becomes enjoyable a long a people appriciate it . if life is simply to consume time , it could be awful time for waitng the ending .
