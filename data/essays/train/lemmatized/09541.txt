in france the education system seach to bring the most of knowledge possible . there is no specialisation until the higth school and even there the specialisation is not really clear . as a result french student have got plenty of knowledge on serval subject but they have to do long study to have un precise knowledge of some thing . i do not think that this way is the best way in the world in which we live , in fact , in our world we ask people to be ready to work very soon . and the fact is that you can not work with a broard knowledge . the only thing you can do is speaking whith people at restaurant and amazing them thanks to your general culture . now to have a job you have to be specialised because the technology of our day is very specific and precise , you can work if you do not know precisly your job . for instance , what do we think of a doctor who know a little about economy , a little about astronomy and a little about the way the body of a man work . to my self , i would not want to see him when ever i ill . but i have to say that thing are different when you already have a precise knowledge of some thing . when you have a job and when you areable to do it well , having a spread knowledge of academic subject is a intresting thing . first , it will help you to understand th e world you live in . if a good doctor know same base of economy he will be able to understand why the price a some product or drogs rise . and then , having general knowledge is the mark of open minded people . those people alway try to understand so they learn . this could give a good image of you to the society . to conclud , having a broard knowledge is good only if you are able to be precise on at least one subjet .
