cars are one of the numerous example of the human being 's ability to always have a more practical life . they are part of technology progress that enhanced or facilitated our life , and that become more and more complex and numerous . but will this phenomenon continue in the future ? in my opinion , there will be more and more car in the future . this is the result from the incredible technological progress that we witnessed since the second world war . indeed , century ago , the car appeared with limited capacity . nowadays , thanks to business and technology , we can watch a movie inside our car , we are more protrected than ever with all the security system that virtually every car ha ( abs , airbags ) . in addition , the car ha become a major way of moving , since many people use it to go to work . and since city are growing , and developing country will enter in their industrialization phase , there will be more car . in my mind , there will be more car within twenty year due to the development of emerging country . in rich and industrialized country , the car is a thing without which we can not live anymore . you need a car to work , to travel , to go to vacation for instance . the developing country tend to evolve like the rich country . as the society ha changed in those latter , society of developing country such a china is changing also . it is evolving towards a more consumption-oriented society , where merely everyone posse a car . therefore , the number of car should increase . on the other hand , the environmental issue have forced u to be careful of what we produce and how we use our environment . it becomes more and more important to protect the environment so that we will not face dramatical event in the future . since the pollution mainly contribute to the ecological alteration , from now on the emphasize is made on the protection of this environment , or at least the reduction of factor that worsen it . thus , there may be limitation a for the use of the car and for other pollutent . in conclusion , i think that there will be more car in use in the future . it is the logical result of technology and industry progress . most of the people use a car , but it ha become a comfort more than a need . but i also think that there should be le car inasmuch a the environmental issue are becoming a real problem for u and for the future generation .
