i do not agree that the best way to tarvel is in a group led by a tour guide . i can agree that it can be good but in my opinion it is not the best way i would like to give an example from my own life in order to illustrate why i do not agree . before i came to new york , i wa in madrid in order to get master degree in law . when i wa in madrid , i did not have so many oppotunity to work a a student . for this reason , i used to work a a translator or an assistance for a tour guide . many time i attended many tour with tour guide to help them . last year at this time , one big group which consists of more than 35 people came from turkey and the travel aggent wanted me to help the tour guide and i helped . i wa together with this group for almost 8 full day . as far a i could understand from their behavior and opinion , all of them were much more different than each other . i would like to give an example from one of our activity such a visiting the museum of prado which is one of the most famous musuems all over the world . while some of them wanted to visit there , a few of them did not . like this example , there were so many conflict among people who came for this travel , in addition because the tour guide got angry with them , he wa travellling by himself and he did not want to help anyone during the tour . because of him , i had to help them a i wa a tour guide even though i wa there just to help this guy . as long a i wa in madrid , i faced so many event like this while i wa working a an assitance of a tour guide . if there are so many people such a more than 10 people in the group , a far a i know and have an experience , to satisfy all people is getting difficult . in my opinion , when all people who attend these kind of travel know each other , we can consider that one of the best way to travel in a group but if they do not know each other , i can not say the same thing . for all these reason , it can be summuarized the trip or travel can be best way when you travel in a group , if you know with whom you are going to travel .
