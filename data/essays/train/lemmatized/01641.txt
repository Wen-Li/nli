it 's up to people and what they want to study in their current life , they choose to study more than one subject and some just focus on their one and only subject . i am a undergraduate student , i had my long time choice up , i have one last semester , and i have chosen that i want to study electrical engineering , but , i have considerd that i dont only want to study electrical engineering , i also want to study language , there are these two type of language that i really want to learn , which are japanese , and italian , it 's cause when i see people talking other language i say to my self that they are brilliant and clever people , it 's not a easy a you think it is studying more than one subject , it make you look more expieranced and much clever when you mention that you talk more than one or two language . my basic point in the last paragraph , is that i want people to think and consider the same thing i am thinking about , i am sure if they do think the same way i am thinking , people would study more than two subject 's . right , people ask themselves that we are only good at one subject , for example which is business , so we cant study engineering cause it so hard and complicated , what i say is that this is the point of the reason why people should go for more then one subject , it doesnt only teach you about engineering it also teach about expierance for example , now you have a house to build for your family and you dont have any clue what to do , you cant let a person rip you off by selling you equipment that you never heard of , so if you had that knowledge , you could get the thing you want and how you want it . i am not basiclly talking about engineering this go out to all the other subject 's . the main reason i am talking about is that , it is important to study more than one subject , because it give more knowledge and expierance in life .
