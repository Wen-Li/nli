i agree with this statement , because mainly fact that are learned without understanding disappear from memory much faster than understood idea do . also if a student understands an idea he or she can always relate other thing to that same idea that wa previously understood , whereas learning a fact without understanding limit thinking skill . learning fact in my opinion may have a lot of negative effect on student , because on an exam a student will not be able to recall what wa memorized unless the information wa understood . when student memorize fact they are not stimulating the logic part of their brain . not stimulating half of the brain will have a negative effect on the student . if a student is taking a biology course . in biology , student must memorize a large amount of word , and from experience it is just easier if the student is able to split the word into it 's combining form , with an understanding of the meaning of each combining form . this way the student know what each part of the word mean , and is then able to remember the word , because the meaning of the word now make sense . i strongly believe that althought it is much more important to understant idea , rather than just learning fact , it is still very important that the idea a student understands are also memorized , or encoded into the memory , for him or her to be able to recall the idea when needed . in some case thing can not be understood , say for example if a student want to remember the room where his or her test will be taking place ; in this case the student must learn the room number with out understanding it .
