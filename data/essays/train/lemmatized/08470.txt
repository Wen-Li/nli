in the first place i am the kind of person who like to know about different theme and academic subject , but i think that is better to concentrate in one specific subject because you are not going to be able to have a deep knowledge in many subject . i believe that is better to concentrate your knowledge . some people may think that is better to have broad knowledge of many subject . this idea could be true but i am sure that le is more . for example if you are studying something realated with the art like graphic design or filmmaking . in thouse field of study you have a wide varaiety of subject to study and learn , but then you have to choose and concentrate in one subject or theme . for example in filmmaking you can choose between different field of study like producction design , direction of photography , editing , screenwriting or directing . even if you have a lot of subject in common then you need to specialize in one subject . for example if you want to be a film director you need to cover and know about different theme and subject like painting , art , literature , lighting . but this doe n't mean that you need to have a deep knowledge in all those thing . those thing are going to help you to understand about how thing work but i believe that you do n't need to be able to handle the lighting for example . finally i think that life is to short to have broad knowledge in many thing . i prefer to concentrate in the thing i enjoy and know about them
