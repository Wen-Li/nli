i disagree with the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' . i think having a broad field of knowledge is a important a specializing in one particular subject . having a broad knowledge of many academic field only allows one to know the shallower part of each subject . one who doe not specialize in any field can only be deemed a `` amateur '' , not `` professional '' . a person with broad knowledge in many academic field but no deep insight in any subject can never design gadget a well a professional engineer do ; they can never navigate plane a well a professional aviator do ; they can never compose music piece a remarkably a musician do . .. hence , we need people who specialize in one specific subject to make our world a better place and to run our society smoothly . however , specializing in one one particular subject ha drawback a well . for example , in singapore , the university place too much emphasis on specialized knowledge . that lead to a work force that is rather narrow-minded . as a result , singaporeans tend to be le creative and le likely to think out of the box . also , people with different academic field might have difficulty in communicating with each other , making people more isolated . on the contrary , the tertiary education in the united states emphasizes on both specialized and broad knowledge of the student . it make people more prepared to make sound dicisions in complicated circumstance which involves different academic field . for instance , a politician who specializes in politics only will not be able to make sound sound policy in environmental problem . it is also likely that he might take the lobbists ' word blindly . hence , it is also important for one to have a broad range of knowedge . in conclusion , i think it is equally important for one to have broad knowledge of many academic subject and to specialize in one specific subject .
