the importance for student to understand idea rather than fact is a crucial point when you are beginning high school or when you are going to the university . there is a moment when you say that the most important thing is to understand theory , concept or idea before you should do practice or practical work . personally , i diferred from this idea because i think there are two kind of job , the analytical one and the practical one . when you work a a cleaner o do some practical work where your physical effort is more important , then there ha nothing to do with concept or idea to understand or identify . nevertheless , if you are working a a clerk assistant or administrator in a bank agency you should know the specific procedure about the job and the condition that are relevant to succeed . however , it is true that both kind of job need rule and specific condition to be done . in the first case , you will be able to follow instruction from your supervisor and the area of cleaning such a the schedule and you will have to respect the time of your labor . imagine you are in charge of cleaning window in a seventy five building in china . it is probably that you are a very well calified cleaning worker , because it is not the same to clean a three floor house window than the building in china . surely , there are many technique that can be described in some manual or any specialised book but the condition about the high and the sensation of the altitude are very different from the one described in the manual . here the point is about the practical fact yous should have to succeed in your labor . you may read about the way to clean the window but you will not learn everything from just reading about the concept : you should do the job , you should be in contact with the labour to prove the condition and everything . as far a i am concerned , i think it is important to understand idea and concept but it is more important to learn fact , specially when you are doing physical work . talking about my personal experience i should mention that in most of my profesional performance i learnt the best from the responsibilites in charge of than from the concept i studied .
