in university , student have both to undestand idea and concept and to learn fact . in my point of view , these two thing are totally complementary in a student learning-process . it is true that , depending on the area of study , it is sometimes more important for a student to understand idea and concept , or in contrary , more important to learn fact . for example , a student in history will have to learn a lot of fact and date to be able to talk about a war . if you do n't know these , you are not able to explain them . learning fact happens first , and understanting idea , after . mathematics or even economics student would rather say that it is more important for them to understand a theory or a concept than learning fact . if you understand an idea you can thing about it , re-use the idea , or even learn from previous mistake than have been made in the past . after that , it could be interesting to learn when a theory ha been though or where . moreover , if you understand something very well first , then it is easier to remember fact about it . for instance , when i wa in high school , i had lot of difficulty in learning fact and date in history , especially concerning the cold war . after speaking to an older student , i realised that i wa n't able to memorize the fact because i did n't understand how it happens and why . after understanding something , you sometimes remember everything without ever noticing it . in my opinion , understand and learning are both important for a student . however , during all the year of study , student have to learn to think , to take decision , to learn from mistake , not only in order to find a job , but also in their everyday life . because studying is not only being able to learn fact but it is also the development from a child to an adult , i agree that understand idea and concept is the more important .
