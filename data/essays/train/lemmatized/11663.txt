how can i help my community ? it 's a question that young people doe n't have in their mind . i 'm agree with the statement because fewer and fewer teenager give enough time to helping their community . i think that it 's not correct this behaviour of young people because every citizen , especially young people , ha a moral duty towards his community to do his best help . i live in a little town near milan and i know a lot of teenager that are interested only in what can produce benefit to them but they do nothing for own community . for example , my father is a voluntar and he often brings me to a voluntary circle but i notice that the number of young people in this place is so small and there is a lot of elderly people that might have the help of a person who can be stay with them listening their story . i believe that it 's very important that a old person can have someone to speak and to give him some precious advice that surely he/she can transmit to young generation . i also think that young people might give their contibute to a lot of activity proposed by community . in fact in all the community there is a great request of some work that can increase the knowledge of the young people . this work can also be a good reference in the personal curriculm vitae , they are occasion that teenager should n't lost in their cultural experience .
