i agree that the most advertisemnets are actaully making product seem to be much better than they really are . one of the reason which it make are when the marketing system are covered up with larger and better advertisement , then people will buy them more and more that make the higher protest and so a their company and also store . the other reason is in our life almost commercial are making people to think of something or buying depends , so each commercial are trying to catch your eye and catch your attention , and that is why many company in thesedays are saying only good thing and showing out too much lie because of making more money . i really do n't understand how this society ha become like this , liyng just for money and always people talk about bill how it go all those kind of stuff . what if people figure out that , they wo n't buy product anymore because thier quility is n't good and it 's diffrent than what commercial saying . however then comanies will make better advertisement to catch their attention again and when people do n't buy those product anymore then they will be doing samething again , over and over . as i said . yes i do agree for this statement and therefore to me company should make fair and true advertisement so the society can stop wasting money on bad product by covered up advertisement .
