technology progress ha changed the world physically but also , and above all , mentally . whereas in the past helping their community wa a priority for young people , i think that this trend is progressively disappearing and that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . because the progress ha made that people are not `` forced '' to live together anymore , because the world they now live in is more individual , and eventually because the new world they live in doe not fit with trhe conception of a community . in a non so distant past , people used to spend most of their life where they were born . indeed , good transportation system were not yet developped and it wa a lot more difficult than today for young people to move from their home . then people really lived together a good part of their life and i think they were by consequence closer to the others than today . emotional and physical link between people were stronger and this led naturally young people to give time to the community . nowadays nothing ` force ' young people to really belong to a community , they can move easily thanks to technological progress and do not need the others to simply live . i think that is why they do not develop and feel this notion of community and then do not dedicate enough time to it . moreover , this development of technology contributes to create a more individual world in which all that could bring a community is available : knowledge , entertainment , etc . .. everything is possible alone and then young people do not need anymore the help of a community . for instance , they can play game on the computer alone , whereas before the only way to distract wa to play with the other child of the community . this make that they will le focus on the community . and finally , the world young people live in today , is a world tending to make confused the notion of community . now young people have contact with any part of the world they want , people are not separated anymore , are not `` stuck '' anymore into community , they can discover other community and this opening of the mind maybe lead to make looser the attachment to a community . the world in which young people live in today is more complex , individual , and open on the rest of the world . those three factor contribute to the `` loss of interest '' fro ; younf
