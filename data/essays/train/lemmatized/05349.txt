in my openion young people do enjoy life more than older people . this is a very evident fact and can be said based on reason . firstly , younger people have more risk taking and dander facing tendancy than older people . young people are carefree and more enthuziastic than older people and hence they tend to perform any activity for just the sake of enjoyment . while older people do not have that carefree and risk taking attitude . older people are much mature and tend to focus more on the danger and possibility of damage or accident that lay ahead . so , younger people many time enjoy themselves by taking up risky sport like car and motor-bike racing , bungy jumping and para-sailing . secondly , the phsical condition of older people doe not many time allow them to move to different place and perform many fun related activity . while the body of younger people is more flexible and strong so they get le tired . so , they can enjoy by taking up sport , long country tour and other similar activity a a source of enjoyment for themselves . also , young people are more flexible an adaptable towards the change in the culture and in technology and hence more by going to a disco , pub , getting tattoo , playing game on computer and using various eletronic item like i-pods and mp3 player . lastly , though it is possible for older people to enjoy life but they are not able to enjoy a much a younger people due to other limitation . older people have many responsibility of family , work and society on them . so , they are not able to enjoy themselves a much a young people who are free from these responsibility and have much more time to enjoy . therefore , it can be said that due to carefree , flexible and risk taking nature of young people it is possibe for them to enjoy more than the adult who are le flexible and have much more responsibility on themselves .
