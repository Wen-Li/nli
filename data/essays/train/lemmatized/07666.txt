many people say that we need to study a lot of subject when we are high school student . actually , when i wa a student , i could n't understand why i have to study everything . i wanted to study just i love it . however , i really think that study many academic subject are important than just one specific subject after i became adult . there are two specific reason why i think so . at first , we need to have knowledge of people study since human appeared many many year ago a a human being . when human just borned in antient time , there were n't anything but people studied themself and inovent many thing so we are now . we need to study their history to study like mass , language , chemistory and so on . then , if we study many academic subject , student know that which one is so interested in them . it 's most important thing . for school is providing many subject , student can learn new category of study . it 's good experience for them . after that , they can decide which one is really good for them and it 's good oppotunity for find their mejor in univercity and job in the future . in conclusion , if people study just a specific subject , it 's perhaps better . she or he could be expart in the future at the specific subject . however , when we study many thing , we can know a lot of knowledge . it 's not only their job but also use these skill for many social situation . i really think that it 's necessary to study many academic subject for improving our sociaty and idea .
