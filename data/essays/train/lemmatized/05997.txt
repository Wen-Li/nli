i 'm in complete agreement with this sentence , because i can experience this problem in the city where i live . nowadays young people are too busy in school and afternoon activity like sport and music , so that they have n't time ( and sometimes no desire ) to help their community ; it wa different not so many year ago , when boy had n't the same opportunity to keep their life busy with enterteining activity ; for this reason , although many of them had to work hard since their childhood , they tried to spend their time with some friend in activity which helped thier community . as i said before , i can experience the lack of child 's partecipation in the life of the community in my own city . for example , in occasion of the annual festival for the saint protector of the city , each year the inhabitant of my city organizes a big festival ; actually it 's a good one , well organized and joyfull , but the problem is that since i could remember it ha always been the same , each year the same kind of festival a the previous one ; well , i address the cause of this `` routine '' to the fact that no young people join in the organization of the festival , so that a great source of idea and renewment are n't used . but it 's only a small example belonging to my own space of life . anyway i could find more significant one ; i mean a bigger problem of distrust that young people feel towards society and a consequent absence from it life . more and more people are n't interested in political life of community anymore ; and a proof is that the political class of today ha an average age very high ; there are no young boy who ha the fervour to enter the political life and bring a new young fresh air of renewment .
