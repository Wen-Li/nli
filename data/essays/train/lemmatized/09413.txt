travelling to a new place can be very exciting especially if done by group . the best way to get to know a new place is by having the opinion of someone who know what to show , but a tour guide can be very monotonous and tedious if you want to explore . if you were to go in a group of people to a new city , travelling with a tour guide can be safe and interesting . the guide can show you the local attraction such a a church , cathedral even a local bar , but it is way more fun if you go on your own , and experience the church maybe even pray a little ; go to the cathedral and look at the thing that you want to look at and not what the guide want to show you ; and get to a bar and sit and enjoy with the local and not with the guide and the group who are usually in a hurry . another good reason for going on your own , is that you can always stop wherever you want and feel free to shop , visit , stop , eat , drink and do almost anything . a guide will always tell you or induce you into what to do or what to look at . if you were to plan a visit to your personal sighting , because there is a reason that motivated you to go to a certain place , you will do it in your own schedule , at your own time and rhythm . plan when and where you will eat . when you 'll come back to your hotel and arrange your day according to your interest . meanwhile , the guide will look for the best schedule to do a much a possible in one day , try not to leave anything out , plan where and when you will eat , and most important look-out for the group 's interest which is not always your own . finally , a very important and problably exciting reason to go on your own and not with a guide , is that you can meet people in your visit and end up leaving with that person to visit other location and getting to know the place through someone else 's eye . or if you travel with your couple , it would be romantic to walk and visit together and not with a guide or the group . as you can conclude , travelling by yourself to a new place is much better than with a guide . it is personal , exciting , and most important , adequate to your best interest .
