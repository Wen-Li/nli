success come taking risk trying news thing certainly give a very good idea about what all thing one is good in doing . this statement of mine confirms that i strongly agree the the fact the `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . its easy for one to just follow the routine of his life , like what he learned in the school , from his house , from this professional and keep following it to lead a normal life with out attempting to try something new . this happens mostly because many of them are sacred of unsuccessfulness by which i mean people are not ready to take defeat . such people do n't belive in the qoute like `` winning and lossing is not important , it just that how you play the game '' . i personally agree that trying new thing help you to become successful because trying can help you to learn all the other capability in one self for example some body took a job of pizza delivery for say various reason like sudden need of money , droped out of college and while doing this job he learned that he know so much about the city that he can try to be tourist guide . in doing so there is a big risk invole in giving up a well earning job to a somthing fairly new . but until unless he do n't try it he will may never in his like be able to do anything else expect being a pizza delivery person . secondly , it help you to know how to deal with different situtation at different point of this . if one fail in his first attempt , he know what all precaution he need to take incase he try to do the same thing next time . one of the strong example i would like to mention at this point is `` gandhi '' . he wa lawyer and could have kept on practicinghis profession but instead he took the risk of this life , career , social boundary and steped into the indian reveloution for freedom . and by the end of the all the event he became the most powerful leader of india and a regarded the same till now .
