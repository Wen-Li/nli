when we look from the past to nowadays , we would discover a lot of successful people . these people had mostly pay a lot of time trying new stuff and experienced new thing , and that is why these people can succeed . therefore , a lot of time , it is true that successful people are those who try new thing and take risk rather than onlly doing what they already know how to do well . people who try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well often succed . these people often work really hard to find new stuff and new idea . people who want to succeed oftne need to take risk in order to succeed . although they might not end up liveing with good respect or belief from other people , their success are undoubtable . for instance , one of the famous scientist who had exclaimed that earth is round ended up by putting in to jail for a while , but his successful career is now no doubt that his theory wa right . therefore , people who are able to try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know what to do well often succeed . on the other hand , people who do not try new thing and take risk but only doing what they already know how to do well do not often succeed . if a person do not try new thing and discover new thing , one would only be a professional in one 's field . meanwhile , that person would be a really tiny chance to find new thing like those who succeed . for example , if a smart student is good at science but he doe not try to find any new thing in science , he might only be a good teacher or professor in his field , but instead of being a successful people who find new thing . hence , it is clear that people who do not try new thing and take risk would probably end up being profession but not succeed in finding new stuff . successful people often try new thing and take risk to accomplish their goal rather than doing what they know how to do well . we should learn good characteristic from these successful people , and trying to do our best . hopefully , one day we would become those successful people who try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
