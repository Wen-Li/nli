i partially agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . being young genereally mean that you are single and dont have much responsibility on your shoulder . young people show great interest to experiment with various option they are given . they show enthusiasm with lot of energy . older people also enjoy their life but in other way . these way are very different from that of the young people . they enjoy their work , home , child , and if they are retired from their job , they enjoy each and every moment a they spent their entire life earning , taking care and doing their responsibility . however , being ready to experiment sometimes could be very dangerous . young people in a mood of being too enthusiastic to do new thing , may fall prey to drug and other illegal activity . having no responsibilties make them a kind of free bird which can make young people reckless in the work they do and also be harsh and insensitive towards fellow being . sometimes having no responsibitly make young people not to take thing seriously about their personal and preofessional matter , which eventually lead to depression and sometimes life threatening . older people due to their age , failing health and other reason may not be that optimistic about going and doing an outdoor activity . most of the old people love to go to museum or go to a picnic with their family or play golf . young people usually prefer to go to pub , trekking and some adventurous game and place . they prefer activity which are risky and also challenging . however , i feel that it is all in one 's heart , what you feel about yourself , what you want and what you can do . because your age is what your heart feel .
