i agree with this statment because in the future le people will obtain car due to the advanced technology in the mechanical feild which might produce new invention that might be easier to use , safer for the enviroment , ha a lesser consumption of fossil fuel and doesnt cause traffic jam which is a major problem faced by our community today . cars now adays are a major head ache to the people who live in developed city due to the traffic jam caused by them . this started making some scientist to think of macking hay while the sun shine by building flying car which could have special air track and traffic signal which will stop the traffic jam . ofcourse they are still working on the project trying to minimize a possible the car price to offer opportunity to major people to buy this kind of car . many goverments started thinking of building under grount train that also will fasilitate the decrease in traffic jam and at the same time provide convinience to the people who use them a thy will make them reach to their wanted place in a lesser time due to their high speed and it make them also save a lot of money a they dont have to pay for petrol or car maintanence . not to mention that the train ticket pice will be very low . other goverments like in china enhance the people living their to use bycicles to go all around the city by macking special track and signal only for bycicle user not to mention the secial parking rod that are placed in front of each building to make it much more esier for the people over there to park their bycicles safely and head on to their job . in conclusion the use of car in the future will be alot lesser than now adays with the help of our goverments and scientist who are really working hard to give out their best to reach our comfort .
