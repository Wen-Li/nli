when we are old can we say that all the joy of the life is lost easily ? can we say that nothing can make u happy and make u to feel the beauty of life ? of course not ; in every part of our life time we can find a beauty to be happy . it is important to feel happy , not to feel upset for the time that past . so , older people can enjoy their life , because of their past and their remainings . older people can recognise the beauty so easily than the younger people . at the young age , our life is more passing within a rush and hurry and bacause of this reason we ca n't see the clear detail of life that can make u happy . sudden desire make u more satisfied . hence the older people spend more time on earth , they can understand the long term change more easily . for example the growing of a flower , change on earth ; like season , like sunset etc . as an other idea , i can say that older people have more stable friendship than the younger people have . they have more strong connection between their friend and these friendship satisfy them more . talking with an old friend about the past and good day , spending time with them can make them happy easily . on the other hand , older people have so much good memory about the past . by remembering them , they can enjoy the life more easily . younger people are all on the start point of life and much of them doe not have enough good memory about their past , because all their of short life period past in a hurry and with complex thought about the future . as a conclusion , to get older in age doe not mean to be older in emotion . besides , after the fast time of our younger day , the real beauty can more easily recognised . it need patience to be old and this patience help old people to understand the meaning of life .
