today , the information is very easy to get , and every company need the people who have many knowledge of different field . so , i think if student can learn broad knowledge of many academic subject . then , their thinking will become more extensive , and they can get a high-paid job . finally , they will have good development of their future . nowaday , internet is very common . therefore , every country is conneted with each other . it mean everyone will compete to the other people more serious . for examle , ten year ago , the student in taiwan just needed to compete with the taiwan people . now they need to compete with china student or american student . therefore , student need to have extensive knowledge and it will help them to create new thought . next , if we have many professional skill , like computer managing or finanical skill . it can help u to get a high-paid job . because if the company hire this kind of people , it seems that they have different field people . so if we can be this person , we will get a high-paid job , and the company also can save money to hire many people . but how to let u have broad knowledge ? the only way which i think we should learn different academic subject in the school . if we just focus on one specific subject , we will lose chance . some people think if we do not focus on a specific subject , we will not learn very well . we will not be professional in our field . in my opinion , i think it is wrong . if we just learn one field , it may be easy for u . but in future , we will be sad because we can not comete with the other people , therefore , i agree it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specizlize in one specific subject .
