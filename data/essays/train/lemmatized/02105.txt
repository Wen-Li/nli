i agree with the statement , and feel that only a hand full of people spend enough time for helping their community . the following are few of the resons why i agree . first of all , the young people are so much inclined towards their job and shaping their carrier and looking for leading a luxurious life , that they hardly get any time for helping their community . they have time to go to the pub and hanging around with their friend but hardly any of them spends time for their community . recently , i approached a friend of mine to accompany me to an old aged community , that run for the old people who have been abandoned by their child , only to give some food to them that my mother had prepared . but he began to give all lame excuse that he ha to go out along with his parent 's . later i found out that he wa at home the whole day . he did not even think that by doing so how happy will they feel . also helping their community implies that the person ha some humanity feeling in him . moreover , the young people in their teen are so much so influenced by their friend and other activity that at a point they even do not behave properly with their own parent 's . for them , their friend are their everything . such people hardly spend any time helping their community . looking at this rate the young people , must realise that after some age even they will not be young and also they will be in need of young people for help . atleast , having this in mind they must spend time for helping . the above reason make me feel so , in order to overcome this , the young people , especially the student 's must make it a routine to spend some time , not much , but atleast half an hour per day for helping the community .
