some people think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , while others think the against thing of the first kind of people . i think i am a person who disagree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , and i disagree with statement for many reason . first of all , i think that is very important for student who they are do n't have much information in their life and they do n't have much experience in their life so in this way it is more important to learn fact than understand idea and concepept because with the learing fact which in formation they will need it in the future life to build strong family , and also the will get useful or they will benefit from this fact which they learned it , in this way the will have alot of backround of different information , for example when i am student it wa more important to me to learn fact than to understand idea and concept because i get usaful from them by when i used these fact in my daily life so the result of this experience that i have alot of information i use it in my daily activites . second , in this way when you learn fact you will become a clever person and in thin way you will be good and smart in school or university . in the end , i like to advice people to do iy
