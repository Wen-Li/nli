saying that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today is , in my opinion , false . currently peaple need more and more mooving essentially for their job . in developing country , car is one of the more used transport system . today we are addicted to our car . it is thrue that there are environemental problem caused by the fact that car consume gasoiline and that reserve of petrol decrease . it is a real probleme yet , and some peaple say that when we will not have petrol it will be not possible to continue to drive our car . but it is not my mind , i trust in research and science i am sure that in twenty year we always will driving but with another oil wich will be better for the nature and the environement . new sort of oil are tested like agriculture oil for exemple . but the main futur energy are clean 's energy : like wind , sun and electricity . some engenneer student have made some experience in order to taste a car witch go on with solar energy . today honda had market an hybrid car witch use two differents energy : gasoline and electricity . we can even buy a car witch use electricity or natural gaz today . the probleme is the expensive price , but i thing that in twenty year progresse will decrease the price of this new sort of clear car unless the price of petrol decrease . .. i think that i am realistic if i say that it 's impossible that the petrol price drop because reserve are le and le important and it can not change .
