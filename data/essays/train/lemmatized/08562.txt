although i do agree on the fact that student shall understand idea and concept about their particular field of study , i do n't think that those idea and concept are more important that learning the fact about them . much on the contrary , i think that learning about the fact of a particular field of study or subject is a important a understanding general or specific idea or concept . actually , the use of appropiate information about certains fact can help the student to better understand the ( sometimes very abstract ) idea , concept or principle of their field of study . for example , a professor can give a lecture about the common feature of all human society . he can talk about how different society , both isolated from the other , can develop norm and custom that are strikingly similar . this is the main idea , or concept for an antrophology of sociology class . but by showing certain fact , the student can better undestand these idea . the teacher can talk about the similarity between the myth and legend of norse and celtic people which , despite the geographical and chronological isolation between those two group , developed form of seeing the world around them that are quite similar . another example that support this could be found in biology . you can learn that all living organism share common trait , like cell , dna , protein , and so on . but despite these similarity , life in earth is so diverse that is actually hard to see how can plant and animal , for explample , be closely related to each other in any way . it is by the study of the fact that student can grasp the fundamental concept and idea and better understand them . one can better undestand how plant and animal are related to each other by , for example , watching sample of each under the microscope , or by perfoming chemichal analysis of their tissue . the fact relvealed by experimentation and observation can not only help understand abstract idea or concept , but it help the student develop new idea and concept , which in turn will be nurtured by new fact . and that 's how knowledge , wheter in the science or even the art , grows over time .
