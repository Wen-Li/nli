i would definitely agree that young people have the more enjoyable life than older people . there are two reason : physical strength and sensitive feeling . to begin with , the phsical strength is necessary to enjoy life . for example , if people go to the other country for travel , they have to carry the heavy baggage in which all equipment for travel install . generally speaking , it is easier for young people to complete , a compared a older people . additionally if they could not carry heavy baggage like older people , the area where they could go is limited or they have to pay money to make someone carry . older people will not go around . because they have the phsical strengh . therefore , young people enjoy to travel in the other country , even though they have to move with their heavy baggage . in the second place , the sensitive feeling will lead to enjoy life . if people face any art , such a picture , music , painting , they will able to obsorb in their sensitive feeling . for example , gradually they are deeply interested in music and they would like to learn and play instrument . in my opinion , young people have the sensitive feeling which is need for playing instrument , a compared a older people . on the other hand , it will be clear for older people that the sensitive feeling will be decreased when they start learning instrument . that 's why , young people enjoy life to face or learn any art . as a result , i would definitely agree that young people have the more enjoyable life than older people , a thinking about the physical strength and the sensitive feeling .
