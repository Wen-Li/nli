as a i learned during my sociology class , a successful person is someone , who ha achieved important goal that have led him to important position of success . of course developing new project and obtaining positive result bring risk and doubt , but the only way to improve and cross personal limit , is to take these risk and solve them . someone , who prefers to do only what he is sure to be able to do well , is a person who will never become successful . nowadays , the working situation show how always more company are looking for employee , who have the following competency > initiative , goal orientation , flexibility , self growth , and so on . a candidate in a job selection must prove , that he is a person with initiative in developing new strategy , and improving the company-s performance . a society will appreciate more a person , who demonstrate passion and interest in taking new challenge and facing risk , rather than someone , who doe not want to improve . no company will give a promotion to an employee , who doe the same work since year , just because he is sure of doing it well . a bos will give a prize to that person , who is able to develop new plan and positive approach for the company . on the basis of what i have just statet , i strongly believe that to become a successful person , i should try new thing and take risk , showing my motivation to improve and grow . as example , i can look at my uncle , and at his professional career . he is now a successuful dean of a high insitute of business administration in damascus , syria . before having achieved this high position , he experienced delicate situation , where he had to deal with all those risk following a new project , such a opening a high institute of business in the middle east . the positive result show how initiative can make a person successful .
