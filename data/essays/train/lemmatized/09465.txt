education is most important thing for improving , but education style is more than important education . because , education style effect future improvement in the science . how can we educate the student ? must student understand idea and concept or learn fact ? i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all , student must understand idea and concept . because , if they do not understand base of theory . they can not improve their information about issue . they only try to remember everthing which they learned . so , we must teach the student how they understand idea and concept . when a student learn the idea and concept about something . they can understand a lot of thing related with that issue easily and improve themselves alone . for example , a student is tring to learn an issue about mathematic . if he doe not understand idea and concept related issue . he doe not learn that issue . he will not that course in future and we will lose this student . if we teach him idea and concept correctly , he will like that course and we will not lose this student . he will work for science in future . learning fact is other way of teaching , but i think that it is old way . when we try to teach student fact about something . they must remember everything related that issue . a lot of student do not like remember something where they come . it is diffucult and boring for them . they do not know anything about course . they must remember a lot thing . maybe , they will remember everthing which teacher say but , they will forget everthing . they do not remember anything in future related course . thus , learning fact is not good way . in conclusion , we must choose teaching how to understand idea and concept , not chos
