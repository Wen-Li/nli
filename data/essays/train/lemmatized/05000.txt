success represents a kind of obsession for many people , something that everybody aim in his/her life . and i am one of them too . if we look in a dictionary , we wo n't find an exhaustive explanation of what this word really mean , for instance success is a very personal concept that can generically be related to the achievement of something , no matter what it is . but once that you successed in doing or obtaining something , there is for sure something more you want or you tend to . that 's why successful people always look for new challenge . i guess that success can be defined a a kind of adrenaline , a drug , in fact the more successful you are , the more you want to become . for example a i wa an outstanding athlete in the practice of judo , i became part of the italian national team , and even if i should have been satisfied by this sport achievement , i wanted more . therefore i began to practise many other sport in order to be fit and to demonstrate myself that i wa polivalent . but what i have to admitt is that i wa terribly attracted by risky activity such a climbing and free-style skiing , and that 's what i eventually did . i think that this attitude of successful people could be compared to mountain trekking , for instance when you reach a peak in the alps , you are very satisfied , but then you start thinking about the rocky mountains , and then to the andes and then your only desire become to watch the earth from the everest . in the end i support the idea that successful people are considered by society successful because they never give up in their ambition and in their strong will to discover or to achieve in something . that 's maybe why christopher columbus discovered america , why we drive car , why we use mobile and why it said to be that armstrong wa the first man who did the famous first step on the moon .
