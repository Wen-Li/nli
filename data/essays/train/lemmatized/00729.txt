i disagree with the mentioned statement . a successful person will be having complete knowledge of his specialization . he is generally percieved to be a master in his field . this , generally is true . however there is also another particular trait of a succesful man i.e he will also try to explore new avenue to improve his knowledge and skill . this is again percieved to be an over the top move or a `` risk '' . but this is not true , because knowledge is an ocean whose depth are unknown . a successful person is not satisfied with the knowledge he ha got and always try to do one better . a successful person always belief that if he loses the quest for knowledge he will lose the will to succeed . also if a person is satisfied with whatever he ha got and achieved it lead to it stagnation and he doe not grow a an individual . hence it would be inappropriate to term this quest a a `` risk '' . a successful person always enjoys the pain for trying out new thing or venturing into new topic . it may appear a a risk to teh watcher but for a successful person it is the divine pleasure of learning . this learning could be of various type ranging for wide range of subject to learning something which is embibed in the nature . as long a it is constructive in building his character he is happy . more over trying new thing make u gain knowledge which is the biggest gain in life and nullifies any other loss that we could experience . a successful person can start his life fromany adversity he face utilizing the knowlege he gained by venturing into various diffrent thing . hence it would be inappropriate to say that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
