success is usually the result of doing something in a new and sometimes extraordinary way . successful people like bill gates , michael jackson , or donald trump were successful because they did thing in a totally new and unconventional way . bill gates dropped out of harvard and revolutionized the software and computer world when he invented his well-known windows software . very successful people tend to do thing in an unconventional and new way in order to create value for themselves and society . these rather extreme example of successful people are far above the usual definition of success . nevertheless , they demonstrate a certain way of dealing with idea and vision . successful people have to take risk in order to become successful and make their idea or dream come true . if a person only doe what he or she ha done his entire life in the same way over and over again , it is evident that this will not lead to outstanding success and recognition . people are successful for doing thing in a new way and , therefore , they are rewarded for what they achieve and not only for what they already know . of course , a person 's success is always combined with a lot of risk and luck . when bill gates left harvard in order to start his own business , he made a very risky decision . what if his computer programme would have failed ? but successful people have to take on financial and personal risk to convince other people , to find investor for financing , and to prepare for long time of hard work . in contrast to that , there are people who like thing the way they are and appreciate what they have . these people might call themselves successful and happy although people from the outside might disagree . therefore , it kind of depends on your personal opinion whether you call yourself successful or not . the extreme example mentioned above do not happen every day and involve a high amount of risk and a spirit of adventure . in conclusion , i generally agree with the statement . but the line between success and failure is very thin and it always depends on your point of view whether someone is successful or not .
