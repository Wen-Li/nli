human kind always need idea , concept and fact to reach good life satandards , therefore understanding them is a very important respect for human life . everyone ha different point of view about the idea of concept , idea and fact . some assume that it is more important for student to understand idea and concepsts in , contrary to those , some think that learning fact is more important than understanding them . i personally agree with the second idea because of some reason . i think fact are basic thing to understand thing and they are both real and nondebated thing . first of all , fact are information which people should leran to reach a thought . if a person doe not have any information about a topic he or she can not say any thing about the topic . for example a student is required to say his or her thought by his or her teacher about a school lesson first he or she must read and search about the topic and must get information about lesson to have any idea about it . fact are real thing . they are basic of thought . we can not create and idea or concept without learning them . so fact must be teached the student in school . in addition to this , fact are real thing which make u more intelligent and add u extra knowledge . so we should teach them to our child before they gain ability to understand idea and concept . by that way ever thing may be more clear for them . they will not face any problem while establishing an idea or concept . owner of idea must know about fact too . at last but not least , a i talked about a little before fact are real information which have no doubt . so we can not discus about fact but idea and concept are special for people they can be debated because of this reason . so to not confuse childrens mind , teacher should talk about fact and they should teach fact to them . for example 2 adn 2 is 4 it is a well known fact and very clear for every one but an idea of a someone else may not be clear for every one . all people may not be agree about the idea of a person . it is a very natural situation i think . so that show what important is the teaching of fact . all in all , a i said before , learning about fact is more important because of both being basic thing and also real thing a well a no one ha a chance to debate a fact . the long and the short of it is that it is more important for student to learn fact than understanding idea and concept .
