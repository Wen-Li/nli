young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community no i dont agree to the above statement . in the present generation people are able to earn money by many way . in olden day rich are allways rich and poor are allways poor . poor people can not go to school they bont have any support from any one . the development in the poor people area is very le . in the present day people have came to know about the importance of education so every one started going to school there are maintaings there surroundings neat clean . those day there are no club , play ground , camp . if childrens want to go to school they need walk mile . but in these day we can see club play ground , school and many thing in each and every colony . these young people are able to earn money a lot they are able to spend for them self and helping others . even though they might not help in direct through hand but they are donating monry to some club . by this i like to say that young people are helping for the development of there community .
