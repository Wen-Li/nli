it 's definetly better to have broad knowledge in a most of subjets a it is possible . there are two main reason that prove this conclusion . in the first place , general knowledge allows to undersand the world a a whole , were all is conected . it 's important to undersand that any action ha influence over other thing or person , and the connection of that influence are only discovered with a broad knowledge . for example , in the business world , to undersand why sale of a product go down , you cant only focus in the price , becouse there may be many other reason that cause lower sale , for example a macroeconomic enviroment that had changed . in this case , an exhaustive examination of the cost , or a deep analisys of other product price would be unnecesary , and a waste of time and money . another benefict of the general knowledge is the adaptation . broad knowledge prepare u to rapidly adaptate to a changing enviroment . the much knowledge we have in many subjets , the faster a change to adapt to the new situation can be made . that 's becouse understanding the whole an accurate diagnostic can be made , and prepare and serch if necessary the specialist to solve particular problem that appear in the adaptation process . taking the same example used before , a broad knowledge of the business allow the businessman to notice the change in the environment , and react just in time to adapt the product or the company to the new situation . a specialist maybe would only detect that sale in certain market are decreasing , and something must be done , but probaly he wo n't have a clue about what to do . therefore , it 's clear that a correct academic preparation must include a much subject a possible .
