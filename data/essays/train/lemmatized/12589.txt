learning fact is more important than understanding idea and concept . in my opinion i disagree that understanding idea and concept is more important first reason is that experincing idea and lesson is more effective way to try them in our daily life . we learn many thing in school and from friend but when to do and get benefit from them . second reason is that understanding idea is more likely to lose than learning fact . we someone learns a fact , it stay in his or her mine because it is a fact . third reason is that learning fact is more interesting understand concept .
