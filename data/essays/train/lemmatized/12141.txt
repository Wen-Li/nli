i certainly dont agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . if a person want to enjoy his/her life they can enjoy it no matter how old they are . enjoying life doesnt depend on how old a person is , however ; it depends on how the person is . being sociable , appreciating what you have , and have the positive way of thinking are all characteristic a person contains but it differs in people , what kind of person they are . being a sociable person ha a major affect on a person . if a person dislike being around people then he wont be able to enjoy life because he/she are not seeing people of different culture that entertain you . this unsociable person would end up being alone not wanting to interact with the outside word . one of the major reason that would make a person enjoy his life is appreciating what he/she ha . if a person doe not do so he would n't be living that of a nice life . for ex : if a poor girl is friend with a rich girl and this poor girl want to wear and have what the rich girl ha the that is a big problem because the girl would not be able to afford certain thing . by not appreciating what she ha she would suffer alot and would n't really enjoy life . if a person want to really enjoy life he/she would no matter who he/she really wa . sitting around thinking of all the bad thing would just depress the person more and more and not allow him/her enjoy there life . therefore a person shoudl just live his/her life and enjoy it . in conclusion all people would enjoy life no matter how old they are . if the person want to enjoy life then this person would enjoy it no matter what .
