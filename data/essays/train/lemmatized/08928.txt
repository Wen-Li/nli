the issue whether `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' is a contraversial one . on the one hand , young people enjoy life because they do n't have enough responsiblites . on the other hand older people tends to enjoy life in various aspect such a they can relax most of the time , they can do whatever they want because they do n't have any restriction . however on the final analysis , i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do because younger people can do whatever they want i mean that their body nature tends them to move faster , showing great energy on everything they do . one reason for my belief is that , younger people have le responsiblities at the time of studying or even before their marriage younger people mostly spend their time on doing thing which may not be useful for them but they think of enjoying life to the fullest , the immaturity in them make them think life a god gift , but a the people grow older they will have more maturity because they have seen the true colour of life based on their experience and the responsiblities they have to bear at the higher stage of life . another reason for my belief is , younger people will usually get boredom if they go on studying continously , they tend to relax at that time by watching a movie or by going on a ride with their freinds but older people eventhogh they worker harder there ultimate enjoyement is relaxation which may be in the form of sleep because their body did n't permit them to go out frequently and enjoy with freinds . perhaps , the another contradictory reason is younger people tend to study a lot because most of the individual will have high aim in their life so they spent most of the time by studying but it mostly depends on an individual who see their life due to this particular reason we can say that they dont seems to enjoy their life but most of the old people will not have good health to enjoy their life because the body doe n't permit them , but if they are looked after by their child , they will spent the rest of the life by enjoying their self so finally i believe that younger student enjoy life more than older people do because they can have le responsiblities and due to the small age the energy in most of the individiduals is very high to do anything they want but older will not have much energy a young people have to do anything they want .
