my opinion is disagree . i think young people should help their community . i have two reason . first of all , young people in other word , student have much time than working people . after school , many student have a part-time job for earning money . it is important for them to do a part-time job . they can buy many cloth , shoe , snack , and so on . but , i want to recommend them helping their community . this may free . but , they can know new thing which do n't learn in the school . for example , they can know about old people . there are various people in community . so they can talk with who they do n't usually talk . old people know many thing than young people . secondly , young people live in their community too . not only clean their own house but also a park , a road etc . m
