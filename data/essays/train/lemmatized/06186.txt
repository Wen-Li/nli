travelling is one of the most exiting thing in the world . however , it is not possible to travel everyday in one 's entire life because of both time and money constrains . therefore , in one of the rare occations that a person travel , it is important to plan the trip in the most enjoyable way . while some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , i prefer to travel alone or with only family member or friend . below , i will discus the reason behind my preference . it is true that when you go to a new city or country , you need someone to take you around an show you what famous scenery are in the city . however , these may not be the place that i would want to look at . everyone is so unique in the world , so everyone ha different interest . what the tour guide show me may represent the preferenc of the majority , but it may not be my preference . therefore , when i travel , i would prefer to do my own research on the city , so that i will know what i like about the city or country and go visit these interested place . moreover , this way can make me know the visited city more . on top of the different interest people may have , travelling time is another problem that may arise when you are travelling with a group led by a tour guide . it is simple to illustrate this point . to a tour guide , it is a job to take you around the city , so he will only work during his working hour which is usually from 8 am to 5 pm . however , to me , travelling is one of the rare treat that i have , so i would like to make it a enjoyable and long a possible . i would not like to go back to the hotel at 5 o'clock and go to bed . instead , i would like to explore how the city is like at night or after the tour guide 's working hour , but i can not just ask the tour guide to work overtime . besides different interest among people and difficult scheduling of travel time , privacy is another main reason that i would like to travel without a tour guide . in some occations , travelling is a chance to spend some private time with partner , family , or friend . therefore , it is not always comfortable to travel with a tour guide . travelling is such a nice treat to any one , so making it interesting , flexable in scheduling and private is crucial . therefore , i would prefer not to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
