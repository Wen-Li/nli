the very word enjoyment can be inferred differently by diffrent people . each and very person ha his own perspective about life and thus on thing enjoyable . but , considering young and old a two group of people . rather than group of unique individual we can mention generally and not with convection who enjoys more . when people are young they have a lot of vigor and curiosity for life alltogether . this can be reflected in there activity a compared to the old . if you take for example , a teenager is more likely to have a funfilled action packed day than an older person . if a person doe more stuff in a day , say work for that matter and he like it he is enjoying . also , when you are young you have lot to do . a young person ha not lived a much a half of the elderly . a young person ha lot to enjoy . but , the elderly have gone through the whole thing and dont find it interesting or are altogether out of place for enjoying the stuff . the most important factor is that the elderly are not healthy and this imposes a few restriction . i dont think an old guy would love to go trekking with his grandson . even if he love to , he possible can not do it practically . so , this indirectly restricts the option available with them and thus restricts there enjoyment source . the problem mentioned above also affect the elderly pshchologically . they develope a certain pessimistic attitude . even if they can , you wont find them getting indulged into activity . lets consider that they do participate . but , this too will be on a self concious basis and they wont be able to let go completely . so considering all the above factor and even though you consider a few exception . it is very clear that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . as , even though older people may have the intent to but the are not capable , because of the above mentioned reason .
