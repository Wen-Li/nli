education is different in every country . so ; e country prefer to specialize their child in one specific subject , whereas some others country prefers to give many differents academic subject to their pupil . my thought is that having a knowledge of many academic subject is better than beeing specialized in one subject , and this for many differents reason . first of all , in our daily life , we all need differents knowledge . as an exemple , we can take a typical day of someone living in a rich country . let 's say this person ha to do his grossery shopping . he will need some knowledge in mathematics for that . if he want to save some money , he will need to calcul in his head which product is le expensive than the others . if he ha a budget , he will have to calcul how much he is spending so when he will have to pay , he won4t be surprised . moreover , we need to know thing on many subject if we want to have a social life . i think that when we are with friend , many subject are discussed , and if we do not want to be seen a a stupid man , we need to know thing in many differents subject . if the school teach u only one or two subject , we will have to be with people coming from our social class , because they will have the same culture a we do , so we wo n't feel stupid or rejected . this would be a break to the social ladder . finally , if we think in a practic way , having a knowledge on differents subject will allow u to help our child when they will be at school . i think that everybody , when he wa a child , ha been helped by his parent , or by someone in his family . it help keeping the generation in touch and it also help the mental development of the child . as a conclusion , we could use a sentence of a famous philosopher who said that a perfect man is someone who ha a good spirit in a good body . it mean that if we want to be in a good health , we have to practice some sport , of course , but we also have to know many thing on differents subject . those are the some reason why i think it is quite better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . but we can wonder what do the politics think of that nowadays if we look what they are doing in france , where they want to specialize the child when they are 14 . ..
