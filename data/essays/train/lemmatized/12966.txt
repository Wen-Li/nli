i am a kind of peason who agree with the oppinion that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what ther already know how to do well . the life is one time . therefore , we tends to think that we want to live with calm and happy life . however , i believe that we have to keep challenging . one of my friend ; his name is yu , he is in london now . we used to be classmate when we were in senior high school . since he wa a student , he always said that he wanted to work in the united nations . everyone know it is really hard to work there . however , he ha never given up his real dream . after he graduated university in tokyo , he belonged to the government a a member of economy department . then , he decided to go abroad to learn bussiness and economy . after this desition , he kept studying and finally he got a ticket to study abroad a a nation scolarship . now he is in london and study in bussiness school . after graduation , he is going to back to japan and work for the goverment again , but a a member of international department . then , he is thinking about go to united state and study 2 more year . after all , he is trying to apply to the united nations . this is still a dream , however he is trying new thing , even though he should have good salary to keep working in japan . though , i am not sure that who is to be called a successful person , i am thinking i am the one by myself . most of my friend are working in japan . they have kept working since they graduated their univercities ; it ha been almost 10 year . they have a carrer now . therefore , some of them became a chief of their group . however , i have never worked in japan . i am a kindergarten teacher . i used to work in indonesia a a staff of jakarta japanese school . then i came to united state to work a a same kind of job but defferent style to teach . sometimes i am warried about myself , because i am still single and i have no carrer in japan . however , i keep doing what i wanted to do . i feel homesick sometimes , hoewver , instead of that , i can meet new friend here in america . they make me encourage and make my mind more challengeable . thus , i think successful people is enjoying their life and very bright , even though it used to be hard . people who can have a challengeship can be a succesful peason .
