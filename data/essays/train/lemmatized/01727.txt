in today business , advertisement ha become the most powerfull tool to sell a product or a service . this advertisement ha reach a certain point where sometime it give a product certains future that seem to be better than the product is really . in the past day we have experience few of these situation where after an advertisement of a bathroom cleaner which are very powerfull , they can cut the grease , remove any kind of dirt and unclog any bathtub ; turn to not be true after using them . onother exemple is my underwear that i bougth base on the advertisement ; which suppose to be very strong , color resistant , lasting for long time , wa discolored after the fisrt laundry . after two week of using them they become so weak that they start tearing into small part . the most disapointing situation that i have experienced is my car , which i bought by looking an advertisement in a newspaper . it describe this car bieng very strong , confortable in driving with a warranty of about fourty thounsend milles on break . after ten thousend milles of driving , this care wa not drivable again . the break need to be replace , the wheel started chaking ; and almost every thing need to be replace in this car . base on a personal experience , i agree that most advertisement make some product seem much better than they really are .
