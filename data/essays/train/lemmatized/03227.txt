i agree with the statement a these era people have comparitively le time a to the era which ha passed by . this era 's young people have more involvement in other task . they generally have more of task to complete than the hour in a day . in today fast living life young people generally have lot to do a they have their social life to be maintained , a well a religious life to be handled , or let say a peer group life . their a certain thing which a community asks for , let say their helping towards society uplifting or making a change in the community a the time change . as these young people need to handle their community and their outside world well enough to have a balance in thier life . community a welll should be quiet adoptive to a young people manner . as these community too should allow change in them a the time change or the era of people change a these factor can only attract young people to the community . young people have more to the place like pub or disc or any other fast running place a these youngster do generally copy the thing which facinates them more . as these thing or place have a attractive outlook which make the young or any age group follow them . the fact to be considered here is how to bring these people 's intrest in community task , a it can be done by the parent a setting a good example in front of them and to teach them the right thing or ritual from the begining so they follow accordingly and help to continue . these young people are normaly ready to be molded a you mold them they will be moulded , the community ha to be the one to moulding the people in their mold . as i generally feel that the intrest among these youngster is to be brought from within and not from saying or asking a this should from the soul and this can be done by building their community closer a these youngster are the one to follow are community to the future gener and if they dont their will be an era where community would be rare to find .
