i agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for the following reason . first of all , driving car will spend more money than other public traffic because the price of car fuel , gasoline and gas oil , will be raising . for example , i remember that in 2003 when i wa in my first year at showa-shell-sekiyu , a large oil company in japan , gasoline price of japanese market wa le than one dallor . however now , it is raised about one half dollar . as the above example show , driving car will spend more money than other public traffic . second , people will be thinking about environment more deeply and make a new low that limited the number of car . for example when i wa a eleventh grader at okayama joto high school , a public high shool in japan , i wa able to swim in the river next to my high school after school . but now , the river ha been very duty because the new road wa made by the river and a lot of driver throw away their garbage in the river . at last , our city make a new low of emitting from the gas oil car . if the number of car had been increasing , the beautiful environment would have lost away . as the above example demonstrates , people will be thinking about environment more deeply and make a new low that limited the number of car . in conclusion , i strongly agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
