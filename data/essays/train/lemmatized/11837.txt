today car is considered a commodity : most people have one and even in a family of three or four people we can find more than two . since the day it wa invented , the production of car ha increased in an incredible way : from a small factory with few people working in to the incredible phenomenon that we call `` mass production '' . nowadays , also , when we talk about car production , we must talk about mass customization : everybody can choose the car that best fit his own taste . at the time of ford , if one would buy a ford t he had to take a black one , because this wa the only colour available . today , instead , you can indicate which optionals you want in your car , such a cd player , mp3 player , air conditioned , abs and so on . when we think about the future we must consider different problem about using car . first of all , a big problem is represented by pollution , wich ha raised in level in a dramatic way . a possible solution to this problem can be using hydrogen fuel instead of oil . in this way we can continue driving car without polluting with smog the atmosphere . another problem we must think about is traffic . probably world population will grow in number a it ha happened in the past . this mean that more people will want to drive a car and so there will be more traffic . a solution to traffic can be building new street or highway but time will arrive when we have to stop because we do not have space enough or because this solution is too expensive . thus , i think that the statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' is quiet correct . in fact , i believe that the problem i have already described will make people think about alternative solution . instead of using car , for example , i think we are going to travel by a more developed and more efficient subway net . also i think that train and airplane will become faster and grow in number . in japan , for example , a magnetic train ha developed that can reach incredible speed .
