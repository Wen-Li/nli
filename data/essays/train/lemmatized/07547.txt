who can ever fogot when he wa achild , we had to be older people . if we had achance to choose i think most of people will choose to back to be a child again . because i wa anoty girl i 'd like to be a chiled for arest of my ife and a ay . iam actually with that opinion that young people enjoy lif emore tha older people , physically young people have more energy to spend , more activity to doing all the move , not just setting and look like old people , add to that the sen of discovering and all that question in them mindes . for example when you go to the garden and take aclose look to the people around you , you can see old and young people but whats the differents between them , genarally you will see young people running , playing . walking , and shouting . in the ather side you will see old peope settng , relaxing , and looking around . if we look deepy for our sociaties we will findout that every boody agree with that opinion some where inside him , usually `` how old are you ? '' this is the first question you hear it when you apply to any job , suppose you are amanegar of any company and you want to hire an employ who you will choose old or young man ? . thats why iam wit that opinion try to enjoy your life when you are young , believe me the day that go will never come back again . , dont waste your time with sadness and anger try to love all the people around you try to give your best to make the athers happy , time is like the sore if you didnot cut it cut you .
