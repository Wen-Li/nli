of course that a successful person try new thing and risk , if you do n't make any change in your live , you always will have the same life , for example , when i wa a child my mother only depended in the economic way from my dad , but my mother recieved a extra money from her mother , and with the money she opened a baby store , then 4 year passed from that year until she wa aware that the store wa no selling well , and she changed the direction of her life and began to open a new store dedicated to sell decoration product , and she began to make popular in the city , and with the time she wa earning more money than my dad . now by her , i can apply to a university in unites state , and pay my class there , i could not do it only with my dad money , my mother ha given to me a big opportunity . therefore , if my mother have n't taken the risk to open her store , she maybe would not have the confort that she have now . other story from my grandfather , he wa poor before he came from argentina , his country , and he settled here in peru , however he worked hard and converted into a rich man here , he started to sell everything , and accumulating money , then he work in a oil company and with the time he bought the company and made it big , he helped a lot of poor worker , because they remembered to him . personally i never knew my grandfather , i wa child living in other city of peru when he died . but my father told me good story about him . thus , try new thing , taking risk may give a improvement of life and happiness .
