yes i agree with the statement because they will have the dare to implement their innovative skill after one success . they always try to do0 something better and useful than the others . they will never go with the thing which have done before but they will change or add some more feature for those which have done by them earlier . the succesful people will also take the idea of the others which will be useful for them . they always go with the concept `` try and try until you succeed '' . this is the major concept used by many of the successful person because they wont leave the thing what they want to do . for example i would like to consider mr. darren buffet , one the of the richest person in the world . at first he wa a cool drink seller after that he invested some money in stock market he went into loss side . even though he wa in the loss side he didnot changed the track in which he wa really interested . now he became second richest person in the world . he had only view in his mind is he want to succeed in his field he made it possible without diverting . there are many people whom we can take into consideration . even many of them were not from rich family they became a world important person . we have to think in many way for one thing then only we can succeed . every one is having some of the idea in different feilds they have to implement their idea in their interested field they will definetly succeed in their future . the people who are very innovative in thought will succeed and also become inspiration to the others also . i would like to conclude that be confidential in what ever we do then only we can succeed and be a inspiration to the next generation .
