i agree with this statement . in fact , i 'm sure that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . everyone know about the catastrophic consequence deriving from pollution . for example , our planet is becoming warmer and warmer and the sea level increased rapidly in the last few year . i think that pollution is a great problem , but i believe that we can do something in order to save the earth . what can we do ? we can prefer public transport , such a bus or metro , to car . for instance , every day i go to university on foot . it 's a good attitude , because i can have some phisical movement , i can meet friend on my way , i can stop for a while to buy a newspaper and , most of all , i can enjoy my city . i relax when i go out for a walk and i suggest that you try to do the same thing . so , i suggest that you prefer ecological mean of transport in order to respect our planet and to defend it from pollution . public transport is le expensive than car , so that you can spend that money in other way . moreover , through bus you can socialize , you can share the travel with others or , if you are lucky , you can meet interesting people on your path . for example , last week , while i wa coming back home , i met giovanni sartori , an italian writer . i wa very surprised ! i asked him some question about his latest work , called `` la mala costituzione '' . he told me that he prefers taking the bus because it help him to feel close to common people . i agree with this idea , because i think that through public transport you can share , not only a travel , but also feeling and emotion . in conclusion , i suggest that you abandon you car and you start taking bus for three simple reason : first of all , you can contribute to save the planet from pollution ; secondly , bus are cheaper than car ; finally doing so , you can enjoy the atmosphere of your city .
