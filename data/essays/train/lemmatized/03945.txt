do people nowaday give enogh time to help their comunities ? i think that people nowaday have tired to give enough time to their community . there are several key reason for my position . first , people nowaday have work very hard to survive . they do n't have much time for themselves , not mention about the time for community . compared now to the fivety year ago in taiwan , people had a lot of time for their community because people mainly worked a a farmer . for example , people have to work from 7 to 9 for their company because the competions nowaday are so keen , however fiveteen year age people just needed to work 9 to 5 . it is a industry world everywhere and people have to do their best to survive . people have tried their best to give their leisure time to the community . second , government nowadays always take a lot effort to helping the community so that people do n't have to give too much time to the community . goverments have already made plan to helping community . for example , the government in taiwan allocates human resource and money to every comminities to help child getting tutoring after school for free . there are also a lot policy the goverment paying effort to help the community , such a local security durinf night , providing human resource to help people to solve their difficuties . people do n't have to worry about that they do n't give enough time to their community because government ha already took care for the need of the commnities . many people do n't disagree with me , stating that people nowadays do n't give enough time to the community . i think people nowaday have already spent enough time for their community since they do n't have much time for theirselves and also government ha also put much effort in the community so that people do n't have to worry about it .
