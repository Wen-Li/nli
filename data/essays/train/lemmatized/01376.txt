we can often see many sucessful people in daily newpapers and magazine . have you ever wondered what they have in common . i claim that sucessful people tend to try new thing more and do n't afraid of risk . this innovative way will make them more successful . first , people who try new thing and take risk have more chance to overcome their own lilmits . while they are taking risk , they can inspire themselve to develop , and this self-development will be the foundation of sucess . for example , when i wa in university , i did n't like the subject `` english composition '' a lot , but i had to pas it to graduate from school . when i registered the course at first , i hasitated a lot but i decided to take a risk and then , finally , i passed this course sucessfully . in addition , i had an opportunity to find my interest in english . since then , english is one of my specialty that everyone admit . second , when you are trying to do new thing , you can be more creative . that 's because you face risk and there 's no sample to solve this problem . for instance , let 's take a look at a computer company `` apply . '' while other computer company were focusing on only technology , `` apply '' wa pursuiting a different way , design . while `` apply '' is emphasizing the design , they created more designe than people had expexted . afterward , now almost everyone in a subway ha a ipod in their hand . finally , while peole who love to try new thing are handling their task , they will not follow the traditional way . these new way will boost them to find better and faster way to success . for example , when you do your work in your office or your room , have you ever changed the order of your daily rutine ? at the begining , you might be confused by little thing but , at the end , you will find more fun with better way to deal with your work . in conclusion , i 've mentioned why i believe sucessful people pursut noveler way of doing thing and do n't afraid of risk . that 's because they can get over their limit with creativity . moreover , while they are pursuiting new way , they can find better and faster method to accomplish their work .
