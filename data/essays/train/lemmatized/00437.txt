it is stated that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . according to my opinion , i am not agree with this statement , but i am not neither disagree with it . fisrt of all , i think that it is better to be specialized in one specific subject , because if you learn too many different subject at the same time you will be confused , and instead of learning a lot of thing you will not learn anything . i also think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject because you will learn a lot about the subject , you will be teached everything you have to know about it , and you will know all it different characteristic . for example , if you arrive to university and you choose to learn economics science , i think it is better to take different course related to it than to take , for example , one italian class , one class of modern art and . .. that are not related togetther . in that way you will learn everything you have to know about economics . in another way , i am not totally agree with the statement . i think that it is also an important thing to have general knowledge , or , in different word , to be able discus several subject . for example , if someone only like learning about nature or animal and so decide to be teached only this subject , he will not be able to have a political discussion or an history discussion because he will have learned only one subject . to conlude , i think that everybody should have the choice to specialize in one specific subject , the one they like the most , but they would also have to have broad knowledge of many subject .
