i agree that fewer car will be in use in twenty year than there are today . although , car are the main transportation currently , there are transporations we could use other than car . in addition , more invention would be brought , and also because car are one of the main factor that pollute our environment . every year , our society improves and evolve seeking for better way of living . two of the issue that are disliked from using car are comfort and expense . as we all know , car are expensive to buy , especially good and well-known brand car . great amount of money is also spent to maintain these car for such reason a oil fee and parking fee . moreover , a more people afford car , there are lesser place to park car and the parking fee would increase a a result of their demand , which make our life thougher . therefore , by the time of twenty year , more people would use other public transportation such a subway . secondly , people like innovation . they prefer new technology , good , and idea , which lead to having new inviention of transportation other than car . therefore , in the future , they might come up with new style of transportation which is similar to the car we use nowadays , but that would no longer called car anymore . lastly , the issue i consider here is health . as more and more people afford car , the more our environment would be polluted , which is n't what many people prefer . this is obviously because pollution harm people by damaging their health . fortunately , people are getting sensitive about their health . this phenomenon will possibly reduce the use of car in twenty year . overall , a a human being , i prefer having comfortable life with spending le on car , adore innovation , and having good health . therefore , in my perspective , i think fewer car would be used in twenty year compare to the use today .
