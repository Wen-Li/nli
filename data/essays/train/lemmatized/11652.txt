i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people do many thing that old people cauld not do . when you are young you have nothing to take care of . your body is athletic and flexible you could do what ever you want you can play any kind of sport you want . specaily when you grow most people wish they could go back young and be in school . when you go to school the memory will start from school all the bad stuff you did in school . nowadays i did thing that my parent when they were my age dreaming to do for example nowadays we have mobile phone and we have airplains that can take you any where in the world that why we are feeling the earth is becoming smaller and there is no responsipleties your parent would take care of every thing . when you are old first thing you will look ugly with all of that wrinkels in your face and body and you will start doing surgery to look younger becaus eyou can not face it that you are being old . when you are old you need to have job unless you are rich and when you are old i feel you could not have fun because you are old . you will also have many responsiplities because you would have a family and have child to take care of . nowadays i feel it is not secure to trust people i do not know what will happen to my child if i had child because to many backstappers and many people lie . my wish is that i will not be old i know it will not going to happen but curious i feel sick if i became old and no one want to be old ask . i allways hear from old people wish they will be young back again .
