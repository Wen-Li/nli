in the next twenty year , the number of car used will decrease in the more developed part of the world , where it will increase in the le developed country , i believe . the reason why i a behold such a viewpoint is due to taking into consideration firstly , the nation state 's control of their country 's public transportation policy and secondly , the fact that the thirld world or developing country are getting more and more domain of exploitation for the huge transnational corporation ( tncs ) in our contemporary world . in other word , on the one hand while the more developed country are putting forward legislation that favour more their public and their security , the le developed country , tend to be more vulnerable to the harsh effect of the liberal capitalist economy . in other word , they tend to get more attracted to the advertisement that are shown on television , where due to these country ' people lack of education , a well a the weak government policy ( a a result of weak nation state ) they get tempted to drive carswhere the public transportation is rather poor . let me try to clarify my point by comparing my observation of two country , that is , sweden and turkey . as sweden is a more developed country in economical term and ha accordingly a social state that serf for the benefit of it people , the public transportaion is used hugely ; especially the underground and the bus . however , it is not just the use of these public transportation but also the availability and quality of he service that is provided by the state , which is a factor that count for the reason why swedish people prefer to use the public transportation more than the privately owned car . on the other hand , although in turkey the public transportation is getting developed especially in the two big city , that is , ankara and istanbul , it is still nothing compared to sweden . the bus do not have a timetable a in sweden or the railway is not a long and the line are not a many a in sweden , which a a result make people want to own and use car instaed of public transportation . however , apart from such a case , it also hold true that in turkey people believe that nice looking car affect their social status ( a the education level is rather law ) . in conclusion , the suggestion that the use of car will be used le is not a `` black '' and `` white '' answer . it depends on the social , economic and political condition of a country a well a it status within the global political economy .
