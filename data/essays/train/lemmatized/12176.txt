some people become aware of the limited life span of human being at their early age and try to enjoy it in the best way . however , there are some who are able to recognize it when they come to the end . though , there is not a direct correlation between the awareness of the limited life span and the age , old people generally tend to enjoy life more than younger people . first of all , young people tend to ass the problem bigger a they are actually . since it is hard for a typical young to foresee the outcome of the event , they are magnifying every difficulty they come across . for example , many student in my country , turkey , think that the university entrance exam is the nost important point in their life . therefore , if they are not able to achive it , most of them are damaged mentally . however , since older people ha a lot of experience , they face problem in a calmer manner . secondly , in general , an older man ha higher chance of having enough money and time than a typical young person to do what they dreamed . vast majority of u have little money to spend on our personal life , while we are studying , since we depend on our family economically . also , due to our school and summer school , our time is also limited to do what we want to , while oleders hav all in all , i am quite disagree with the idea of young people enjoy life more than older people do . though i think that youngers have more energy and more desire than the olders , they could not enjoy life due to pressure put on them by their family and the limited finance and time .
