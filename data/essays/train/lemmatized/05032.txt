as we know that `` try and try until you suceed '' a popular thesis . i think maximum number of successful people will follow the thesis . trying to get new thing will increase the ability and capabilty of the person rather than sitting doing thing the same thing that he ha done earlier . there is nothing wrong in doing experiment in inventing new thing . i personally belive in trying new thing rather then only doing thing what they have already known how to do well because trying nwe thing increase our mental ability and thought . even the thing may go wrong in between even though we have to try for that without depression . there are many advantage while doing new thing we may undergo different circumstences that make u feel exciting . this may also increase the skill of a person in thinking ability . another important thing that i strongly belive in trying is , even though we achieve it or not but we feel satisfactory with that work we have done . it give lot of pleasure which make our mind comfotabale . for instance when iam in my school i have prepared a article for school expo which i have struggled hard for nearly 3 month to get it then it ha been a great succeess for that expo and the happiness i got in trying for new thing gave me pleasure for atmost one yearand i continues to try for another article which is very tough to find it solution even though i struggled finally i achieved . even there are many reason going for risk and getting new one is that even the goverment will look after the project that are newly done . even we get reward and award which will give a peculiar imortanceto a person in a societyto those who acheive new thing . the reward we get from the government may also be helpful in the next project that a person is trying . these are the reason to agree with the statement that `` sucsessful people try new thing rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
