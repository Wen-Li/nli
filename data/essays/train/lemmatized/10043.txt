in general i agree with this statement . to support my opinion we should have a look on the markt of the 21st century . there is too little space for all the product that company can produce and sell to consumer . so there is a big supply surplus on the market and every company ha to look for a way to get the consumer attention . big marketing study were done in the last year to teach the company how to sell more product . ther are 3 strategy in advertising a product . the price strategiy , the product strategy and the promotion strategie . the markteting strategy wecomplain in the statement is the promotion strategie . in this strategy company make their product in advertisments much better than they really are . this marketing strategy give the product an additional value and according to this an additional reason to the consumer why to buy the product of this or that company . but in realety the consumer is confused . he is overloaded with information of the advertisement . to escape this confusion he often compare the price of the product and not the additional value . it is also a fact that a consumer will not buy a product again that could n't gave him what he expacted . thats no problem in the short therm but in the long term mouthpropaganda will lead to the effect that nobody will buy this product anymore . in my opinion the best strategy to advertise product is the product strategy . in this strategy company look for a niche where they can satisfy
