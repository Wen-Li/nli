how will our planet look like in twenty year ? this question is on all the conversation about the consequence of what we are doing today . will it look better or worse ? it 's not the debate today but one of the interrogation concern the use of car , which become more and more accurate all over the world . on the one hand , we can think that the number of car will progress significantly in the year to come , thanks to economic progress and innovation in technology . more and more country nowadays use car : in china , for example , the car industry is in great development , and a there are really many inhabitant , we must consider that it will be one of the most attractive market in a few year . but in the other hand , we may add that consideration about environment protection are taking more and more importance , the sustainable development is a recurrent term in speech and official document , more especially , of course , in developed country , which had already known the excitment of car technology and had also already benefit from it advantage . so the point now is to find solution to limitate the damage of car on the environment , such a the recent alternative that are developing in france today . in big city , the public power is making big ad campaign in order to attract people to use common transport [ bus , metro . .. ] or to use a bike . so in my view , it 's obvious that we would never be able to make the number of car decrease because of it general use ; it 's really part of our life and i think that we would n't be able to live without car , it 's now impossible , car have too much incidence . as a result , there wo n't be fewer car in use thant there are today . .. maybe it would be the case in france , and i hope so to preserve our environment ; but if we consider the whole world , car have great day ahead of them . their sale prove it significantly . ..
