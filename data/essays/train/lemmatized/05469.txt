young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , now ; i 'm not sure here at japan , but i know that im my country australia ; we give up our time to help the poor in need . most school do n't have a rule that they have to a least several hour of community service , and everyone except for the slacker strive to recieve the honouring badge of community sevice . especially year seven must try to gain this to show the little kid younger than u that if they want to get a badge they should do community service . the reason for the year seven to try to gain the badge is because the year pre-school - year 6 look up to the year seven a the head of the junoir schiool . so from the statement question , no young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , except those school who have a rule of community service , because most young people care only about them self and not the others . the young people of today do n't understand that they could make a big difference just by helping their community , for example they could organise a fund raiser , but it doe n't have to be big , they could just donate some money to the country that is in poverty , or help thier mum or dad in the kitchen . it 's that simple to making a differnce . so my final answer is no , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , but they could try .
