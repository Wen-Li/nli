i deeply agree with the staments reported . marketing is a fundamental activity for firm , i would say , a very profitable business in which every year million , if not billion of dollar are invested and the fact that advertisement in general are exploited to show product and product 's feature different from the real way they are really , doe not surprise me , even it would maybe surprise many other good consumer . we are used to see almost everyday very colorful and energic advertisemets through so many business channel , like television , newspaper or radio for instance , and we often believe that everything that we buy really make the difference or is totally useful in our life . of course i 'm not saying that people should all undertake a pessimistic behaviour and think that everything in term or product is bad , but they should probably increase their critical point of view , especially when having to purchase a certain good , point of view which could be received with a good education . managers just exploit this lack of criticism , a i would describe it , and , a anticipated before , invest great amount of money in showing their product off in the society a beautiful and colorful a possible , through marketing . consumers are then invited to buy , so attracted by the medium , they go to a store and buy everything they were just so eager to have , and , after a couple of day they have bought something , their interest for what they have bought begin to fall , until it get replaced by a new product which firm 's manager have meanwhile developed . this take place of course for all of the most typical type of product , for the most expensive one a for the other cheaper good of mass consumption . according to me , this behaviour will not stop , being u a human so easily affectable and in our pretty predictable nature .
