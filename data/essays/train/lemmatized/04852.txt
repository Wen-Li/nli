most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . this is because they show the product from only one perspective and is their purpose is to sell . of course , i 'm not talking about lying . advertisements are focused on showing the people the company 's perspective . marketing is a tool for showing to the world the bright side of a product . by showing only one side of the product 's quality , the good side of course ; they covince you that here are not other aspect to take into account . let 's take a soft drink a an example . of course they will show that there are good reason for buying it such a the flavor , the presentation , etc . but they will never show the negative aspect like not being good for your health . on this case , there is not need to lie , but to keep information for themselves advertisements ' purpose is to sell . if there is the need of showing the product a a better and improved product , there are way of doing it . that can be done in two way : by exagerating the characteristcs or by making i the expectator the need of something only the product can satisfy . there are way of adding quality to a product and get around honesty with ease . using adjective that increase a simple charactristic is permited . for example , ad frequently use word like amazing , unforgetable , espectacular , etc , which do not necessarily mean good , but sound `` incredible '' . advertisements often start with a description of need . after the expectators considerate that need important , the product seems the best option for it . in this case , there is not need of lying , but to know the best way of describing aproduct .
