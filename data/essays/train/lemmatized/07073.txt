nowadays is a lot of disccusion about what is more important in the process of learning in the student , we have two possible answer : the first one is to understand idea and concept , and the second one is to learn fact . i think that the answer for this could be finded in the requeriments that the majoriy of job have to day . usually in job the people have to take decision all the time , for that you need to understand the advantage an disadvantage of the possible chooses , and have a good idea of the consequence of your decision . i am going to explanin how the two process - understand idea or learn fact - can help , or not , the people to adquire the capability to take decision . in one hand we have the idea of just learn fact . how you can learn something you can repeat the concept a lot of time , but you do n't understand wat you are saying . in the other hand , if you understan a idea , you can answer a new question because yuo have in your mind a possible path to obtain the answer . for example when i child learn to multiplicate just repeting the table of multiplication , he know this specific operation , but if you ask a new one he can anwer , because he do n't now how to multiplicate two number . but if you teach a boy how fuction the multiplication , the child can answer any question becasue he know how to obtain the answer . another fact , that is important , is that when you just learn the concept if you forgetted you can do anything . but in you learn how to obtain an answer by a logical way , i am sure that you always can be available to answer . finally i strongly believe that the concept are not necesary to learn , inasmuch a they are always in the book . in conclusion , i think that the best way to learn somethink is to understand the idea and te concept . because is preparig you the the laboral life
