understanding idea and concept suggests understanding a way of thinking or understanding how idea are connected and concept can develop . to me , that is more important than learning fact alone for the simple reason that you can apply a way of thinking to many different situation . learning fact only is limiting one 's knowledge to a specific area or subject and doe not even imply that one understands how these fact are connected . however , i still do believe that a balance between both is necessary and depending on what a student 's intended job is , one skill might become more important than the other . let 's consider a historian for example . can a historian specialized in roman history and who doe not know the fact of the rise and fall of the roman empire for example still be considered a historian ? probably not . a historian might indeed need to know more fact than a marketing executive for instance but he or she will also probably be a much better historian if he or she also understands how all fact are connected . on the other hand , i believe that it is more important for a marketing executive to better understand concept and idea than it is to know all fact about a given undustry or product . first of all , a marketing executive doe not need to be a specialized a a historian , indeed , he or she should be able to apply his or her skill to any industry . second , not knowing all fact about a specific field might actually foster creativity and new concept development by removing any `` limit '' of the mind . third , a marketing executive who understands concept and idea might be able to see better synergy between them and apply them in innovative way . however , a i stated above , i still maintain that some sort of a balance is needed to achieve excellency . a marketing executive would be that much stronger if he or she could draw some pattern from past fact for instance or if he or she demonstrates a more precise knowledge of the product or service and it related competition scene that he or she is working on .
