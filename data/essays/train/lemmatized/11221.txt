transportation ha been one of the most important factor in human civilization . according to the history book , roman empire became so powerful and managed to rule a large land because they created road . later , european country could create many colony because they rule the world 's ocean with great ship . now , in this modern era car is the most important transportation . we still use ship and airplains which are far more advanced than vehicle , but they can not be owned easily by many people because of high price . for now , car is the main transportation system in the world . will there be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year ? for now , it is not possible because there is no reason for u to change our current transportation . only problem with current transportation system is `` fuel '' . it need gas , but gas is limited . but last decade , researcher have developed new type of fuel for car such a sun light , water , and electricity , and these new invention are starting to replace old car that run with gas , and we do not use a much gas a we used to compard to the past . there is no way that number of car will be decreased in twenty year . only way to decrease the number of car that are owned by people , is an involvement of government . first , government can increase tax . in many nation , one family owns more than one car based on statistic . by increasing tax rate , family wo n't be able to keep a many car a today . second , if government support the local transportation company financially or perhaps creates government owned transportation company , it might lower the number of car that are owned by individual by giving them more choice of transportation . many nation around the world have a great transporation system , but there are still some country that do not have enough finance power to s from my perspective , there wo n't be fewer car in use than today unless the government get involved with transporation system in the societyy .
