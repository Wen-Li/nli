find the success who is successful nowadays ? what doe success mean to me ? who is more successful , a person who take risk or a person who doe not ? in my opinion , if you are successful in your job , in your career , in you social life is because you have been developing some skill and situation that you already control and you know that they work . in my personal experience , i am a general dental practitioner , or a normal dentist . i know how to do my work in order to obtain good result . i would never try something new or risky in order to be more brave if i do not know for sure it will end successfully . those who take risk to `` try '' to find success is because they have nothing to loose . for instance , imagine i had a business and for any reason it just failed . i would loose all my investment and i would be in bankrupcy . i have lost eveything . in this case if someone told me that he/she had an exeptional opportunity for me to start a business from the very beginning i would take the risk becuase i have nothing to loose . let 's see another example in my professional life . a patient come into my surgery complaining of pain in the central incisor . i take an x-ray and ha a very big infection in the root . i have never done an apiceptomy ( open the gum and cut the root ) and i would never try to do one without the appropiate training a it can be dangerous for the patient . i would never take this risk to be successful in this case . in sum , i completely disagree with the statement a i believe success is something you can find in your day by day life without taking any risk . look for it !
