i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . an education based on the ` why ' behind many different topic will provide a holistic education to student . as a result , student will understand idea and concept . students will have clearer picture . a student will learn a few factual information while he or she is in the process of learning an idea or a concept . the student will become more creative . the student will be in position to contribute more meaningfully to different discussion with different group of people . such learning help student build some skill set such a soft skill related to analysis , thinking . also , student feel encouraged to opt for constructive environment in which the learning is based on idea and concept . students feel no undue stress on remembering fact a just remembering fact are not going to help in the long run . instead of remembering some rule or incident a mere fact , the student will be in position to question the existing those rule and incident . there are chance that more new idea and concept will be generated . for example , recent change such a orgnanized producer in retail sector have resulted in better and efficient process for the end customer . in today 's online world , the factual information is easily available . students do not need to do any rote learning . also , learning fact hamper a student development . students will rely on memory for such a trivial case about which information is easily available . for example , a trivial case would be that how many bone are present in human body . there is no need to learn such fact . instead , once the student is aware that the number of bone can vary during the different stage of life or can vary due to some external factor . the student will be in more position to understand the reason for such a varied number . such a discussion based on idea and concept will provide more insight to everyone involved . in sum , student who understand idea and concept will excel in life from the all round development and will be in position to contribute meaningfully to the socielty .
