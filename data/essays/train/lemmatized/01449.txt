there are three advantage that insist me like tour group . the three reasones are saving money , meeting a new people form other country and more safe . tour guide is the best way to travel from place to place . first of all , saving money is very important to me . i can save a lot of money by this type . usually , it is not too expensive . for instant , i have traveled several time to canada and it costed me just $ 699 per one trip . second , meeting a new peolpe is very interesting . i like to meet people from other country and talk with them . for example , i have met many saudi arabian ' guy during my trip . thrid , it is safer than if i travel alone . for example , i feel very scared when i travel finally , if i save money i can buy gift when i back to my home . also , it is very exciting to meet people from other country . these are the critical advantage that make me agree with this statement .
