i totally agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . because the main purpose of advertisement is to sell the product , of course they need to show the advantage of the product to attrack consumer and hide the disadvantage to avoid unnecessary damage to the product ' image . advertisement , a we know , is a kind of promotion . companies use advertisement to introduce their product to the public and want the public like their product . however , not all product are perfect ; therefore , they will try to just show the good part of the product in the advertisement . in fact , consumer will have high expectation of the product they saw in the advertisement . sometimes , the higher you expectation is , the bigger disappointment you will get . that 's why people often think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . furthermore , advertisement will not show the disadvantage of the product to you . you only can learn how the product actually work or whether you really like the product or not through your own experience . for examle , i saw the advertisement of tacobell 's new product on tv last month . it seemed so delicious and had plenty of ingredient in it . i could n't help thinking about the picture of that product all the time . finally , one day , i bought the product . i wa so disappointed when i first saw the product in real . it wa so tiny and almost had nothing inside . and of course , it wa not so delicious a i imagined before . to sum up , advertisement are made to sell their product and they always only show the advantage of product and skip the disadvantage .
