i think that many of the young people enjoy life more than older people because they have an a lot of time , energy and other fact besides the older people to get enjoy from the life . all of u birht , grow , and dead . all thing ha a time to do and each of them are good when doing at that age . at the age of child or young you have an only jop that is your school at the other time your are free and you can do what ever you want and you do n't have other responsiplty . you can get out with your frend you can travel where ever you want . at that age you have a lot of friend to share your life and make it beatiful . it is the best time to get enjoyed from the life . as a young people you do n't meet by the heavy side of the world . but a you started to get older all thing come one by one and you do n't have time to do your own like . if you have a family you have to think your child , your childrens future , yourwife and go on . i think at the age of 25 's thinking your future will start slowly and this will bord you . at that age you will be grauduated from your universty and you have to find a jop to continue your life . this will be the small start of getting bored from life . also when your are young mostly do n't have a healty problem and we enjoy from the life but a the age get older the healty problem start and this will make u bored and effect u from enjoying from the life . also when you are getter older you have scare of dead . finally the best thing to make life more enjoyable is to get enjoy from all part of your life . this will make your life more suitable .
