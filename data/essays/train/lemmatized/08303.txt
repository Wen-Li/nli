do you have a child if you are married ? if you do , do you think which one is better ? the child is very smart . but , he doe n't study at all because he really like helping his community . the other child is not smart . but , after all , he enters the company which is the most famous one in the world . if i have a child , i want him or her to focus on his work when they 're suppose to study their own work . that is definitely true . therefore , young people should focus on their work . i have two reason why this is very important for them . to begin with , young people have a duty of education . when i wa young , one of my friend wa very kind to everyone , even bad student . also , he wa a member of community for the poor . we thought he would be great person in the future . however , it wa just our thought . nowadays , he is have a hard time living his life with his parent because he ha no job , even could n't go to the college . that mean that we have to do our duty when we have a duty . if we do n't do our duty , someday it 'll bring a bad situation to them like the above case . in addition , actually , young people are not suppose to have a extra time for their community . it sound very strict and miserable , however it is obviously true , espeically in south korea . i saw the article about it yesterday . they talked about most young people attend more than three institute such a english , the piano , the madthmatics and etc . the interesting is that most of them have been going to be able to enter the best college . that 's why most parent want their child to attend lot of private class include regular class of school . finally , what do you think about my opinion ? i think that you ca n't agree with this . however , people should know about somehing like follow thing . if a person did their work well when a person wa young , someday this person will be success . then , they can help thieir community and their society . that is not late because it will be already great job . thank you for reading / byunguk kim
