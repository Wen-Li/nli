learning fact can be useful for a student , but this can not be sufficient for them . understanding idea or concept contribute to develop opinion and a critical point of view about reality . in short , understanding idea and concept you can obtain a `` key of reading '' of the world . you can begin to think with your own mind . first , student need to grow not only phisically but also spiritually and intellectually . learning fact by hearth it is not useful for them . sometimes hystory teacher force student to learn date and hystorical event by hearth . then , after one or two month , student have already forgotten all date and all related hystorical event . it is important , in my humble opinion , to understant the background of every event , and , at the same time , have the ability to collocate it in the line of the time . once you have recorded a date , you can rebuilt in your memory the hystorical background . this is the function of a ` by hearth learning ' . secondly , developing a critical point of view and a vaste range of opinion is fundamental for a student , because it is the moment when he is building his personality . thinking with your own mind is fundamental to living in our society , where everyone act only in function of their own interest . in a nutshell , to live choosing your partner , or which cloath you like , or where to go when you want , it is the secret of freedom . however , a freedom that respect and that take into account the freedom of everyone , a said the french philosopher jean jacques rousseau . thirdly and finally , this is why i think it is important for young people having their own idea .
