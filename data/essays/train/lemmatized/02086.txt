i disagree because it doe not matter to try new thing and this is showing that only doing what they already know how to do well is better than tring new thing . first in fact i wa tring to learn how to speak spanish for 2 year in middle school and after that i mastered how to speak spanish however i forgot to speak english . i used to talk japanese at home everytime . there wa no relation between i and speaking english . my frends are all japanese . trying new thigs make people confuse . if peope confuse amd they can not understand what will happen next . so you have to tell apart which is more important , the future or the present . in addtion i had to take a physical test in middle school so i wa tring to do my best . on that day i did it very seriously and i wa very happy . however my leg wa hurting next day . i went to hospital and i wa examined by a doctor . he said you have to wait for 2 month to heal your leg . i wa in a baseball team and i wa a pitcher of the team . i could not believe it . my friend are disappointed . i wa alone and i can not bear about it so i change my favorate sport . eventually if people try hard and hard or thier body will break . i think that people should concentrate now not the future . in fact present is more important than the past and the future , if people do not want to do thier best or someone complain and scold you . however it doe not matter a little . your life should be decided by you . it doe not relate a little between the present and the future . i would like to import the present not the future .
