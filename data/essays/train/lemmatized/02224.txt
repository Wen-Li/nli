i agree with this opinion that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . i have some reason for support my idea . nowadays , many environmental problem occur in the world : global warming , air polution , and acid rain . these problem cause the exhaust of car . so , if twenty year pas , many people become careful about these problem . also , they think the exhaust of car are serious problem . therefore , i think that the number of people who avoid using car easily come to increasing because they come to regard the problem caused by the exhaust of car a serious problem . also , there are possible situation that the tax of car will be increasing . so , many people come to be worried about and have trouble about the economic problem . however , these day , the government tend to raise the tax in order to make the pention systam batter , in fact . consedering these modern movement about tax , the tax of car is increasing more in twenty year . as a result , people who avoid buying and using car increasing . at the same time , people come to use the public transportation . so , the nessesity of car is decreasing . moreover , if twenty year pas , the society become more convenient than today . so , new environmentlly friendly and convenient transportation may be invented . people come not to use the car . also , in the future , people will come to travel farther than today . so , people can not move with using car . consequently , the necessity of using car is decreasing . for these reason , i think in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the reason is that people will come to regard environmental problem a serious one . also , people will not pay the tax of car in the future because of higher tax of car . moreover , in the future , the necessity of using car is decreasing because of invention of new transportaion . thus , i agree with the statememt that the number of car will decrease in twenty year .
