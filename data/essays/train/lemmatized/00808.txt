i always belive that every age ha it own beauty . when i look around and observe people from different age all around me , i can see that they love to do different thing and they enjoy different thing but they can still enjoy . i do not think that the people who are in their old age enjoy the life le that the young one . a young person may do lot of thing in a single day than an older one . he can go to cinema in the afternoon , go to shoopping in the evening and go to a concert with their friend at night . however , it doe not mean that not doing these kind of activity make the older one enjoy the life le the younger one . the older one may have done all these before in his younger age and may want to do diffrent thing such a having a beatiful dinner with his child and grandchild or may want to have a walk with one of his friend to have a cup of tea on the seaside . people at some certain age are already have the taste of something and they want to do diffrent thing . i do not belive that , this make them enjoy life le than the young people . my mother love to cook delicious meal when i go to my hometown at the holiday , and my father say that the happiest time of my mother are those when i say that ` mum , these are all delicious` . my mother enjoys the life at those time . i can see it in her eye . going to cinema or shopping or to a concert do not make happy her a much a having a dinner with all familiy . overall , people can be happy with diffrent thing in their different age . therefore , they can enjoy life very much at their older age .
