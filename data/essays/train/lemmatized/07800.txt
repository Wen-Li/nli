yes , i agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . people become success because of taking risk in their work . according to the proverb `` success will not come to u , we must to it '' indicates best to ward hardwork . risks is the thing which lead the path to your success . without risks a success man is like a body without soul . the successful people try to take risk in every day of life . they know the value of success and they also know that it will not come without risk . the successful people always try to become more successful than the other successful person . for this reason his take risk in his every part of his life . the true value of success can be only be known by the person who take risk . for example consider the example of the poilet . the poilet want to became success in his aeroplane driving . he take risk in every aspect of his life . he take risk from the starting the aeroplane till the landing . but become success one day or the other . that 's why success include hard work and risk . there are many example in which risk includes , the best and popular example is the child riding the bicycle . the child know the fear of falling down from the cycle and getting the enjoury but still ride . he want to the success in his riding . even though he may fell down and get injured but never stop the his goal to become success . the success come from the inspiration of own mind and soul . for every success risk are the four most step . if one can step the first and four most step of risk then he is successful person in his life . if the successful people think that his the successful person and do same a already he did then he will be in only same position and get decreased day by day . risks are the smaller thing for the successful people . they take risk a taking water . they just see the goal not the problem they are facing and what might the risk they can get . they just take the risk and try to become more successful from the previous . risks are not the thing which you can not do it just imagination of the problem in mind . so i finally agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk '' .
