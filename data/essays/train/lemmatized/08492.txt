to enjoy life is the aim of the majority of people . everybody want to be happy and not to be closed on one 's problem , but it is quite difficult to be unaware of misery and all the plague the world coney . one 's people life is so precious that everybody is looking for a fullfilled one and therefore there is no age to enjoy life . obviously there are differencies between the way of enjoying it for young people and old one . first of all , young people are defined by being non-experienced and so it appears a an evidence that they want to live their life fully ; they are generally opened on everything and interested in all what they see . young people are insatiable . moreover they have the priviledges of youth and they are allowed to have fun in different way than old people . being aware of their fate , young people try to do whatever they want to in order not to have the impression of having spoilt their strenght 's age . to enjoy life is not a schedule or a precise thing so everyone trying to do it in one 's own way . it depends on what we are keen on doing or for example it can be determinated by the money we have . to that point of view , older people who are generally richer than young people are able to enjoy their life thanks to the wealth . but wealth is not a warantee for being happy , especially when it doe not sound with health . we might say that each of u enjoy life in a different way but there is no ageing consideration in happiness and for example a philosophy like the hedonism is one way to reach it and to ejoy life at every age
