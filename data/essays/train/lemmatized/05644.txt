`` do anything a if it were your last and up to the point of perfection . '' i firmly beleive in the statement but i do n't really beleive that only by trying new thing and taking risk a person can be successful . you can reach the zenith even if you are doing what you know how to do well with sheer hardwork and perserverence . behind every spectacular event lie unspectacular preparation . i would rather like to work hard on my asset and plan to excel them other than trying something new and exciting which ha the probability that i might not like it . the root of success lie in the will to exceed in life and a continuacy to a purpose . i loved helping people , dealing with the child so pursued teaching . i think if i continue my same profession of teaching i would be more successful other than trying a new thing all together like nursing . if i continue to teach , i have an enriched experience in the field of teaching and later on i can also apply for the position of a principal . but if i change my field to nursing i have to learn all about medicine and have to start from the very scratch . secondly i think a person get a lot of satisfaction if he or she is doing something they already know . it give a sense of self content and hapiness after that hardwork . if i offer to cook anything for my friend but i do n't really know how to cook , i might have an unpleasing experience after that chore because that dish might not be very tasty . so instead of taking any risk i would rather do something i enjoy and know how to do well . and i do n't think if i wo n't try that i am unsucessful . instead i know how how to avoid ruining my day and how to get the most of it . when you are doing something you already know you develop the sense of perfection and there are more chance to excel in that field . well in the end life is a tin of sardine and we are all looking for thye key . so sometimes we might have to try new thing but my main chore would always be what i like doing the best .
