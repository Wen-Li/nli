i strongly disagree with the best way to travel with tour guide . when i wa a kid , i went to sighting with my parent , relative , and tour guide . it wa the worst experience which i have ever had . here are several reason why traveling led by guide is so bad . in begin with , traveling with guide is formed tightly because it is already planned before the start . it can not give you a free time . not only that , but you can not afford to break even though you can not buy only one present for your friend . i think that one of the purpose which have a tour is relax without busy life . if you go with guide , you will not get any fresh air . second , traveling in a group make people angry . it can be illustrated that some want to stay to focus on what they are interested , others have a desire to move another place because they do not need to observe anymore . in this case , they have to decide what they will do . but any group in this situation would be disappointed . finally , there is a famous maxim - if you travel alone , you are not alone . it mean that going trip alone allows you make frineds . for instance , i went to japan when i wa a freshman in the university . i had a traveling for a month . i can not speak japanese fluently in that tour , i can make friend - nakasaki , murama , and yorisimo . it wa an unfogettable experience . when you are with your fellow , you can not have chance to have new foreign friend . as i mentioned above , i do n't like traveling in a group led by guide . fixed tour planning make me exhausetd . group tour make person dissatisfied . and if you can go somewhere alone , you can get friend . on the contrary , if you are very old , you can like a group tour with a guide . it make sense that if you are satisfied with that , you are too old to feel free .
