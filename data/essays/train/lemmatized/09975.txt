it is better to specialized in one specific subject than to have broad knowlege of academic subject . first of all , human brain is limited there are cuntless of book and knowlege in the world that human being ha achieved . it 's surely impossible that one individual ha all that knowlege . beside if we want to broaden our knowlege the depth of it would be shallow . however , if we specialize in one subgect , still it woul be a lot to do , it woul be much easier than to have broad knowlege , and we can deepen it by study and all kind of effort . second , there'are lot 's of college graduators in the world . however if they have same level of knowlege. , it would be not helpful for each other . in society , we ca n't live with other 's help . we need doctor 's in hosptal , but also nurse and pharmasist . it is efficient and easier to divide the work than one person doe the all the job . third , we need to relay our accomplishment to our next generation like our former generation did . if our ancestor have n't acheive anything , there would be no civilization and industralizaion of present time . the world is developing by the people who study in specific subject . we call them specialist . without specialist the world is not going to be develonped any
