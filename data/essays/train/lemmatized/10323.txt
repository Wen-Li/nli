i think that understanding a concept about a subject give you a better knowledge of it instead of learning the fact related to it . a theory give you the mental preparation to face all kind of fact , studing only fact doe n't get to anything because fact can change during time . if you see and study a fact , you can get the highest level of preparation on that specific issue , but probably it doe n't give you that standard procedure you need to deal with it . i am an university student , my degree course in economic is primarly based on theory , while another university in my city base it course on practice ; people of that university always say that they 'll get the best preparation on their subject because they are studing them from the real world ; a an example they watch the every day stock variation and use model to describe them . i wo n't say that this is unusefull , but i think that instead of it , it would be better to study a many model exist in order to get a complete preparation of all kind of stock market . learning a theory enables the student to understand thousand more , and , more important , could give the student the possibility to think with his own head and enterpret all kind of event with a single way of thinking , which can adapt quickly to any situation . moreover , if you think about how any kind of exam it 's made , you 'll find out that what is asked is usually not what wa said by the professor in the classroom , but is something related to it , something new that you must elaborate with your acquired skill , otherwise is just a memory test ! to conclued i think that a we are not like computer recording data , we should use our brain to understand fact in order to know how to deal with other different situation that we will face . experience can help , but is not enough .
