human being always want to learn more , and gain more knowledge . knowledge is a very broad and complex in relation to the human brain . people may like to learn about everything they can lay thier hand on , but when doe it stop ? when do we draw the line to where we should stop gaining any new knowledge ? should we even consider stopping ? gaining a better knowledge of many subject may be very usefull in a way , because it show that a person ha a very broad understanding of subject . the human brain can only take on so much knowledge . when learning about a large amount of subject , human being may neglect the specific fact and the little detail because of the extensive amount of knowledge that people are not able to process fully . the human mind is a very powerfull tool , but it is impossible to learn about so many academic subject . considering how short a human being 's lifespan is . having a broad knowledge of subject can help society in many way , it also strengthens the mind because it is always processing information . eventhough having a broad knowledge of subject is usefull , the world still need human being that are able to specialize in one specific subject . human being that do no neglect the specific detail in that subject . this broad amount of knowledge in one subject is needed to be able to excell in that area of study and to be able to invent new element in that area of study that can help mankind in the future . people that specialize in one subject can ussually expand a field of study more effectively then people that have a broad amount of knowledge of many academic subject . it is always usefull to gain a much knowledge a one can get , but because of the limited focus on detail , it can be extremly hard to expand in any subject . that is why people need to work together in focusing and specializing in different field of study to be able to excell and help society a a whole .
