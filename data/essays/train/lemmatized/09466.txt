the topic `` young people do not give enough time to help their community '' is a very controversial one . on one hand it seems to be true relating to the other activity of young people . but on the other hand it proposes a negation considering many community where young people itself are the key worker . i would go by the direction that young people do n't have enough time helping the community . firstly , a young mind want to enjoy and spend his teenage with pleasure so that he can cherish his memory when he is old . infact he go by the policy that life is short and enjoy it to the maximum . for example consider a young boy who is more intersted in playing rather than helping his community . secondly , i feel that young mind are already being stressed under a process named studying . he ha homework and other activity called exam , paper for which he ha to spend enough amount of time to improve his career and also his nation a child are the future building block of every country . further he can improve on his field and can also put undivided attention on his study turning out to be a great scientist or professionalist . if he devotes time for helping community , his precious time will be lost a time and tide wait for none . he can not achieve his aim or goal set for himself . another point which support my arguement is young child do not do not have enough interest to help and support the community . the young child nowadays are more interested in enjoying going to night club , watching film and other activity which are hinderence in helping their community a interest or desire drive a person rather than duities . from the above point , i would conclude saying that young child have many other activity and interest rather than helping their community .
