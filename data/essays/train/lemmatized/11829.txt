in my opinion there are two oppositing point of view from which one could see the situation . first you could agree with the statement that successful people try new thing rather than only doing well known thinghs because they can allow themselves to be experimental for there is no financial pressure . they are , due to their success , able to come up with negative effect of their behaviour and they also have the capital to invest in new innovation for example . whereas poorer people or just people without overwealming success might have great financial pressure and have also the fear to lose what they have already reached . so they are more likely to play on the safe side . a poor company might use it old computersystems for a longer time than a rich one for firstly the poorer one doe n't have the needed money and secondly because newer system might not work that dependable . second , one could also tell the story the other way round : successful people might become more carefully because of they 're afraid of loosing their wellbeing life and their position in society which implies that they take not the unknown road . for example a famous food chain would never change the slogain or the kind of marketing strategy a long a the food sell well . in comparison with that , unsuccessful people have nothing to lose so they might tend to try out new thing for it ca n't get worse . a small unknown company may try out a variety of marketing strategy to find out which one cause the highest sell . there are always these two option . which way is meant tyo be taken depends on every individual character which is challenged by a decision like described above . so i ca n't agree the statement that successful people are more willing to take risk in gerneral for there are a many reason speaking against this thesis .
