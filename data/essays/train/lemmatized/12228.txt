the day when one could be genericly called and a scientist or an inventor who knew it all are long gone . like leonardo da vinci wa a painter a mechanic a biologist among many other thing . in our modern time there is so much knowledge that one lifetime of constant memorizing will not suffice to acquire it all . technology and science advance a people contribute to it , and to be able to contribute to it one must have mastered what ha been previously done . todays academic subject are very deep and extensive . in addition , considering that there are a lot of subject , a superficial broad approach will not lead to significant contribution . although it is mandatory to have a borad understanding of thing to be able to relate one work with other area and find us for it . failing to have awareness of other subject can be considered a ignorance , but this kind of attitude and lack of interest ha no place in academic . broader knowledge will get you in to many plesant converstions and you may be able to orchestrate a bunch of specialist from different field to collaborate , however it is not enough for individual contribution . i personally passed a phase where i wa hungry for information and tried to learn everything but then i discovered that eveybody in the world know at least one thing better than me . for example i wa repairing my own automobile and makin my own surfboard when i discovered that someone else can do a better job than me and it will cost them le time . it will also cost me le money if i spend it working on what i know . the same applies for academcis . now i believe that you should do one thing that you know and do it it right .
