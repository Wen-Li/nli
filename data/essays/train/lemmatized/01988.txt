as is known to everyone , there are lot of advertisement ha been created druing this medium period . some people think advertisement make product seem a the same a they really are . on the other hand , some people do n't think so . in my point of view , i agree the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the reason why i agree are a follows . first of all , advertisement become more creative and interesting , owing to attract more buyer to buy their product . if the advertisement are really boring , there is no one will be persued to buy their product . what 's more , there are lot of product in the world . some seller suffer more pressure about how to get a important role in this market , as a conquence , the advertisement will show more information about such good product they sell . even though , the product are really not a good a advertisement present . worst of all , it 's a negative cycle . lots of advertisement follow this kind of trend to gain more profit from consumer . by way of conclusion , i totally agree this statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in order to attract more buyer and then earm more money , the advertisement make product which become more amazing and creative , but not they really are . it is a really negative cycle in our society . however , many people do n't pay much attention about this issue . what a pity it is .
