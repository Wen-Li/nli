when i wa young , i used to think that `` older '' people who told me that `` age is mental state '' , that `` you are so young or so old a you feel yourself '' , or similar commonplace , were either lying or at least looking for emotional justification or excuse for the fact that , well , they were `` older '' and were not going to be any younger in the future . as i approach the symbolic `` frontier '' of 30 year , however , and even though i still do not believe that age is only mental , i must accept that i find more respect and understanding for those `` older '' people in my soul . moreover , i find myself not only respecting those people but also their opinion , which imply that life doe not end when youth end and , maybe even more clearly , that you can enjoy life a long a your health allows you to and a long a you want to do it . right , young people discover everything for the first time , young people live intensively and have the strenght to try out more . there are no night like the night when you discover nightlife , and there certainly is no love like the very first love . the first travel are especially exciting , and the same could be said about the first serious intelectual enterprise , the first job , the first experience a a financially independent being . still , older people who grant this but insist on the advantage of aging definitely have a point . for , in fact , young people do enjoy life , but they also suffer a lot ( that is why the concept `` teenage angst '' exists , a well a one of the possible explanation for the popularity of , say , punk music ) . while the very first love ha - for better or worse - an extreme impact , life show you after a while that suffering related to love only seldom kill people , and that one us to find other person to love after a breakup - which is a thing no younger person dealing with an unhappy love story , for example , would even begin to understand . besides , the level of love you begin to feel and to perceive after some year on this earth are simply incomprehensible to younger people who are still in the process of discovering love - and here i mean not only love between two person a in a partnership or sexual relationship , but also fraternal love , family-love , friendship , and even love for certain aesthetic artifact or for certain idea . experience brings a certain detachment with it , it usually involves distance and a decrease - however pronunciated - in passion , but it also implies deeper feeling - you only need to be old enough to notice that they are deeper . it would seem , thus , that both younger and older people enjoy life , or suffer it , more or le equally - only differently . the experience in life are , indeed , so different and so potentially varieted , that it simply would not make sense to try to locate `` joy '' in any given age or life-period . young people use to enjoy passionately and a if they were the only person on earth , while older people tend to be a little more mature about their own feeling and about their own position in the world . and this applies to suffering , a well . so maybe it would be best to forget categorization based on `` objective '' fact like age and really try to make the best of one 's life regardless of how old one is . maybe it would be better to try to enjoy life and to try to make a much other people a possible to enjoy it without caring about people 's age . does this mean i am an `` older '' person who is looking for `` justification '' or `` excuse '' ? i certainly think this is not the case , but i would let any given younger person to judge , and in the end , i do not seriously care - which could also mean that i have already arrived at this distant maturity . .. which is ok with me ! as long a it last . ..
