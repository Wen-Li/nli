i completely disagree with this statement that there would be fall in the car usage in next twenty year when the number of car being owned by the people is increasing day by day . there is no reason to expect the reduction in this rate in coming future , or atleast in the span twenty year from now . all of u are so dependent on the car that it is very difficult to think about make smooth movement from one place to other without our own mean of transport . so rather than a luxury car have turned out the need of common man . and we all know that the nesseccities ' ussage never decline , so is the case of car now . they will probably increase . also if we see the current newspaper , the detail about the increasing rate of number of car on the road doesnot at all allows u to agree with the point that the car usage will decrease in near future . rather it is truely convincing to say that this number would shoot up to an indeterminable value . also there are several new model hitting on the road every season . this make the younger generation to get attracted towards them and enjoy newer or advanced technology car . also the latest model providing driving comfort make them catch attention of sensible car owner making them ultimatelypurchase it . but at the same time these people just sell off their old car to anyone who will can use it . this lead to new car added on to the road rather than a replacement . the second . would this prove that the car ussage will go down ? not at all . there can be no prediction made atleast after reviewing the above example that can give a conclusion that there would be lesser number of car used by people . the need and dependence of people on car a there mean of transport will lead to raising there number and not declining it .
