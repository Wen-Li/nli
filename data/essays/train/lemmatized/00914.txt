who care about young people care about who ? nowadays , young people do not give enough time to helping the community which doe n't give them enough time to be young and happy ! young people are becoming unhappy day by day by unemployment , lack of money and lack of care in the community . from the past year this community is growing the youth who doe n't like to help the community . the answer in the mind of the young is the same : ` why should i care to help the community that never cared to help me ? ' i 'm one of these young people . i have a grandma and aunt both are living with u and both ha cancer . for helping their house economy i have to work . i know 3 language and i am unemployed over 2 year . now i am having that test to be accepted for a job . all these year where wa the ` community ' ? did all the people in the community think like me ? : ) i have no time for community a all young people in my country . i have to care to help myself and my family . what can young people do for community in that huge lackness hole ? may be this is the result of past generation ' behaves to u . they behaved to their child a they have been behaved by their parent and time show the result : a community divided by million of him or her'selves ' . these people can not even be a community member in the near future . loneliness win the game against happy and cared community by the help of lackness . in my opinion our youth first be helped to find their way and their life then be asked to give enough time to helping the others and the community structure . community create new generation which will create new community . a desperate circulation . who care about young people who care about who ?
