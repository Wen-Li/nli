in these last year big discussion have been raised about the most effective method of teaching . two main faction have resulted : one magnifying the advantage of learning concept and idea , and another stressing the importance of a solid knowledge . i think that neither of the part is definitely right , since i believe that `` the true lie in the middle '' . the first faction highlight the importance of knowing fact in order to continue to advance in learning . moreover , they criticizes the counterpart asserting that without strong knowledge the most complex problem can not be solved even with the strongest deduction . for example , if a student need to face any kind of study , he need to know all the fact on which each argument is developed . on the other side , their countepart contrast such opinion affirming that teaching concept and idea permit student to reach automatically every kind of fact . moreover , it allows student to reinterpreting all the fact they learn from new point of view . for instance , learning the basic concept of the style of an author in literature allows student to understand well all his book without any strain . moreover , they can compare their own opinion with that of the author and can reinterpretate in a different manner the same argument . in fact , it is quite common in classe incentivijng student to discus about social condition in which dante wrote it commedia to obtain a different point of view . in summary , many debate have been raised about the optimal method of teaching . many teacher asserts that fact are needed to learned in order to obtain a complete and strong knowlegde from school , while many other think that basic concept and indeas are enough for student to undestand and learn fast . i personally believe that a strong knowledge should be integrated with a good possession of the underlying concept , because in this way student can reach a real critical knowledge .
