`` you 'll never regret the risk you have taken '' ... this is one of my way of thinking and living . i completely agree with the statement . you have to try new thing and even take some risk if you want to be successful . during our life , everybody ha to make some choice which will completely influence their future . the human being is never complete . we always have to learn new thing to go on . our mind is like a computer which need more and more information to work . the life is a succession of choice which increase our knowledge . we also have to share our knowledge with other people who want to grow up . if we want to perform in a particular field , we have to be ready to learn always more and more until we 'll feel really confident about it . every popular icon ha had to take some risk to become somebody famous and regognized by the others . but this way of thinking doe n't only apply for the richest or world famous people of our planet . it 's also avalaibable for the average citizen who want to succeed or to do something from his life . during our carrier , we are often confronted to make some choice which can influence the future . we do n't have to be affraid of change . when we choose to do something we can only grow up and we will not go back to our initial statement . we do n't have to consider the fear but the proudness of our choice . if the risk to take seems to high , we can share the idea with some member of our family or co-worker . there will always be an experimented person who will give u the good advice to go on . like the animal , the human being ha to follow his instinct .
