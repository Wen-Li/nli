this statement is in my opinion a bit to wideranged . so i think that the people in our society are split in two group : the one who never help somebody and the one who care about the well beeing of others . i will elaborate this in this essay in two paragraph . on the one hand , i think that today society of young people becomes worse in helping each other because they tend to be more and more sellfish . the kid prefer to stay at home alone to play computer instead of going out in parcs and play football with others in the same age . meeting others is the beginning of creating a community : share free time with others . then , in school , many of the pupil do n't want to help their classmate because of the fear to loose something . after that , when the young people begin to work , they want to earn always more money . at the same time , they do n't want to spend a bit of their spare-time to those who could need it . on the other hand , there have been done many thing to get people more involved in helping their community . often they are in form of voluntary work and many people do n't hear about it even if they would like to help . in germany , they have introduced a `` civil service '' . it wa made up for those who do n't want to make the military service , so it is obligatory . since it wa created , they are many young people who work in hospital , house for older people , for handicap or drug and alcohol ill people . today , the government think about putting the military service away and instead of that make the civil service obligatory for all , boy and girl . this would be great , because so everyone get an experience in helping others so that these people would give help next time easier . i think most of the people do n't go and help people by their own , but with a little experience in social work , they will change their mind on that point .
