the relation between young people and the community depends by the education that they receve , and by that depends if they feel correct helping their community or not . the education is made of experience and situation that a people life and of the people around her , so the community in which she life . in the past the structure of our community wa difference than the actual community . i think that the structure of family and the context in which it life have great importance about this theme . in the modern age with the development of great city , the group of living is n't more the village , but a little group that is the family , it is now restrected . so we live in a world where there are a lot of family in contrast each other , because all want the better for them . in this situation we can see how the young people born and growth but overall how those one are educated . when a mother said his son that he ha not listen what the stranger said him , and he ca n't go out alone , the child learn that all out of his family his dangerous , so who live out of the family ? , the community . the church , for example , play an important role , infact it educate young peole in helping the other , but in the modern society , young people do n't believe more in the church , i think it is losing his influce , and the community is losing the education that church can doe . finally , a i said , the fact that young people help or not their community depends from the education that they receve during their life , and in the modern socety this education doe n't allow them to maturate a feeling of community .
