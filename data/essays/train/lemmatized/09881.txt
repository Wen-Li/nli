i certainly think that having a broad range of knowloedge is better than knowing a only one subject deeply . however what i mean is little bit different than what it sound like . for exmaple , if you are a leader of the orchestra , it is really important for you to know all the technique that are used in leading a orchestra . however it can be better if that person know how to play piano or other instrument , so he can at least know that feeling and share the pressure of people who are following his sign . therefore i conclude that knowing many academic subject in one broad speicific subject would be the best . these are the example . misto takile , one of the most respected orchestra leader in japan . legend creater of yokimusa orchestra . question is why wa he so great ? he wa a great leader , his technique were concise and simple to follow , therefore it reduced the confusion of player who are following , but that did not made him legend . he had something more than that ; his ability of playing piano and violin wa good a a professional , he could teach a concert master how to play a piano or violion middle of the practice . he wa also an expert in music history , he wa able to , and actually give lecture about music history in tokyo university . by knowing how to play instrument , he ha share the feeling with player , and give them better , simpler lead . by knowing the music histroy , he understood better about the song . he knew broadly about his profession . that is what made him great . kim mary , world famous zoologist who designed nanjing zoo . she ha been famous because of her excellent and effective design of zoo . however for her to reach this level , she had to finish 5 major . first she ha majored in medicine , second animal medical care , third three-dimension design , fourth building construction and last but not least , zoology . she ha gone through all that to become the best in her area . she know so broad about what she is doing , she could become the best in her subject . therefore i conclude that knowing broad range about one subject is the best answer to the question . if you take little bit of everything , it doe not give you depth understading and it doe not help you a lot , however if you decrease the range and study deeply about all the subject around your profession , it will give you lot of credit , it also might related to other big subject a well . you can possibly argue that einstein wa a math maniac who did not know anything else except math and physic . but he wa genius in a century , very exceptional case ! if you are not , and to be great in your area , i think it would be more beneficial for you to know broad range over your subject .
