i agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . knowing about different topic is not something that is good only during one 's study life , it is good for a long a we a individual exist . there are situation in which general knowledge is very useful . a way to explain this idea , is with doctor and journalist . it is true that later on their professional life medic specialize in one area in specific , but before that , they go through many field of medicine until they finally reach the desired one . in my personal experience i 've known many doctor speciallized in different area of practice and they have been capable of answering or responding accordingly in different situation . the other group of professional mentioned earlier , show u that they never confine themselves into only one area . it is true that along their career they have the tendency to follow one field , but it is a fact that have to know about other thing too . some newspaper have specialized journalist but when they work on shift , they have to be able to handle every kind of information that show up , otherwise , there would be an awful lot lost of information . nowadays , during job interview , many company ask their applicant their opinion on different matter and subject not related to the posting they are applying for . they do this in order to ackonwledge how well prepared they are , and to measure the level of literacy the personel ha . this is a situation that support the idea expressed at the beggining of this essay . just for the fact that everyday we meet and talk to different people , we see and know for sure that we all have a varied diversity of opinion , this is something that is for our own benefit , so for all these reason and example stated before , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
