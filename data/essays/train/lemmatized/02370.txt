do you always succeed to buy a something though it 's advertisement ? some people think that advertisement always convey real aspect of their product because consumer can be know after buying the product . however , i agree with the idea that real product could be defferent from the advertisement in that advertisement have a limited time to attract consumer and we can misunderstanding about that . the main reaon why i think that real product are more disappointable than that of advertisement is that company want to make their advertisement more attractively because they do not have enough time to provide information about their product . for example , when a new car is intoduced in the market , the car company make the advertisement very attractively because they should allure a lot of customer a possible . however , they can not explain all advantage of the car . in that reason , most advertisement are made much better than real . furthermore , when we see advertisement , somtimes we can misunderstanding about the product . seeing a real product is very different from just watching television advertisement or seeing the paper advertisement because we might see the color differently or understand the function differently . for example , when i bought a new computer , i disappointed about the real product because the color and size are different than i expected . i wanted black color and small size computer , but the real product wa grey color and bigger size . in conclusion , most advertisement want to make people attract and we can misunderstand the advertise
