i disagree with the following statement . there are several reason why i disagree with it . first of all , since the population in the world is rapidly growing especially in the developing country , they need car to live a well a those developed country . the more the world population is getting increase , the more car are needed . i think it 's important for those people to have a car in developing country because they can use it in many way to live better . second , the innovation of the technology allows u to have the kind of car that are not harmful for the environment and nature . for instance , some people started having solar-cars , which do n't produce the harmful gas in the air . human have been inventing a lot of new thing and nowadays , people have started making new thing that are good for nature . solar-car is a not only an example , but also produce enegy using wind , earth 's heat , water , and new clear power . surly our life have been getting better . i think it is possible to make even better thing than we have now . but we always have to remember , this world is not only ours . we must not destroy the ecosytem in nature , the living style they have been kept and and the way they are . considering those thing and make new better thing is the best way for both of them . third , a lot of people love car . some people just like having a car , others like driving a car , and the others like riding a car . the level of the japanese car company is very high in worldwide , and one thing that we should proud . it 's a big hobby in the world . for those reason , i do not agree with the following statement .
