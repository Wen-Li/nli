studants must understand idea and concept , on the other hand they must learn fact also . but the question is : what is better for them ??? well a i see , learning fact is more important , becsause idea and concept depend on the person who give it to u , in another word , it may different from one person to other , so whats the reason of understand this ? on other hand fact , are a it is , in all the world , everytime and everywhere . for example , '' womes must work in order to help her husband '' somebody agree , others do n't . well , sombody say she ha to work because she is a human a her husband , so she must work outside home , not only her husband . others say , she is a woman if she worked outside maybe somebody will hit her or even do n't be faire with her because she is a lady . here is an idea the first reason is more powrfull than the other , so what we will gain if we study idea ??? but if we studied fact , such a theory of gravity . in this case we will improve our knowledge , know whats happen in the world and maybe we will take it for a research in order to get a depluma on physics or any other higher level . if we looked everywhere in college we will notice that almost of the study is studying fact . also , what is a student ?? student is a person who study to graduate from a recognized college , recognized from all over the world , so how can he study idea or concept and being recognized ? recognized mean that there is no doubt that he is right , so if he study a concept , what will happen if he is not on right way ?? he will lose everything he did for nothing . and everybody ha his own opinion .
