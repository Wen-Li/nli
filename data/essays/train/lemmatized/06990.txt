trying new thing and taking risk can sometimes make a person more successful rather than doing what they alredy know . however , there are time this can have the opposite effect . firstly , i would like to mention why this statement can be true at some time . people who have learned how to do a job and gained working experience have the choice to just keep doing what they learned or takeing risk . this mean for instance that they come up with a new idea or try to change the way thing are . due to this his bos , customer or other people on whom his job depends , become focused on him and he differs from everybody else . if these new thing are good , he will most likely be promoted or the customer want to work with him again . the same is true when deciding to open a buisness by himself . he could become the owner of a flourishing company when taking this risk . in all those occasion it is important to try new thing and take risk in order to become successful . however , there are other situation in life . now i would like to point out the problem of taking risk in some area of life . risks can develop into a problem while attending school or college . often one is expected to answer in a specific way and not to invent new way . there it is good to do what one know how to do well . moreover , it is better not to take any risk while studying for a test or exam . the consequence might be severe , depending on the risk that ha been taken . for instance , steeling the answer for a quiz , a great risk , might end with beeing disqualified and getting the worst grade possible . in conclusion i would like to point out that one always ha to evaluate the risk with the possible outcome and how this consequence might be achieved in a different way . then
