it would not be incorrenct to suggest that people enjoy their live when they are younger . provided almost every elderly people somehow complain about their current condition and remember the ` old nice day ' with a pleasent smile on their face , one may easily consider that there is more joy in being young . people have always been interested in finding way of staying young . many story have been told about legendary fountain of life , secret formula of miracleous drink that prevents aging in almost every society . how cruel may a person become is descibed in some saga in search of eternity . therefore , youngness ha become an equal term to beauty in our modern life . however , it is not only about appearence . presumably , humanbeing ha the most beautiful stature when he is young . on the other hand , there are some other factor that make it more appealing . first of all , young people are indisputably healtier than the elder one . this simply make life much enjoyable . how many of u have ever heart of someone with sickness and a sheer enjoynment on his face at the same time ? besides , young people have much time to devote recreational activity . concerns of a full-time employee or a parent are usually far from their mind . thus , they can spare more happy moment with their friend , family or other people they hold dear . even during their education , the curriculum are desingned to ensure that they will learn with minimum level of boredome . in conclusion , life may not be alvays fair for an elder person . the more responsibiulity brings the more matter of concern . that is what aging provides . and we have nothing to stop that but being with people whom we love instead of spending our fortune on cosmetic , beauty spa and anti-aging therapist .
