in my eye it is wrong to say that young people enjoy life more than older people . obviously , one could state the fact younger people are healthier and that they still have to make all their important choice in life , they have no regret . furthermore they can try a vast range of activity . because of their youth and health they can do various sport , learn how to play muscial instrument , travel spontaneously to dangerous place and if they have not started working yet , they have a lot le responabilities . all these choice might be out of reach for older people because of their health and social status . in addition to this older people could be in a worse emotional state than younger people . with increasing responsabilities such a bringing up a family , paying for their child 's education , they are le carefree . health issue , e.g. age related illness such a alzheimer 's or according to age impending death can turn life itself into one long hardship for older people . also , they might have lost a loved one such a their spouse or sibling . but nonetheless one ha to take into account older people 's life experience and what they are looking back on . in the course of their life older people have experienced all kind of emotion and thing that turned them into the person they are . this could be a marriage , the birth of a child , the further extension of their family or a huge succes or achievement . they can alsways look back and relive the most wonderful moment of their life , something younger people have yet to experience . and finally , older people are in a way the foundation of their family . to know that one is appreciated , needed and relied upon is something that make life very special .
