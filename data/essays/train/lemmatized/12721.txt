nowadays , a higher education is valuable for a student future career but it is not the main important point . indeed , even if lot of people and company are looking for high-skilled student , when a student have to proove your intelligence , he must have understood all . i personally believe that it is more useful and important to understand idea . fisrt of all , for a professional carrer , even if lot of skill can be a way to enter a firm , a student will have to put into application the concept and idea he learnt at school . in order to use the different concept , it implies that the sudent ha integrated them . furthermore , when a student work in a company , he ha to exchange with his or her colleague . one can not deny that without understanding , you can not express yourself properly . secondly , during his formation , a student must have to learn fact , he can not do it in a different wat to obtain his exam . that is the reason why i am firmly convinced that the student that are able to understand idea are going to be well-appreciated , at the oral cession for instance . to my mind , understanding is a proof of intelligence and a way of differenciation . thirdly , we have to keep in mind that social life for a student is crucial and i personally believe that understanding idea and fact should be a good way to build this social life . indeed , during student life , you have the opportunity to have extra currilar activity such a participating into association . but to do it , a student may be able understand the way the association work , he should also bring his own idea or idea he had understood during his formation . understanding is a way of integration . to conclude , i would like to recap that understanding idea and concept is a way of profesionalization , socialization and integration . when learning permit you to pas your exam , understanding help you to build yourself .
