some people think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , and some people do n't think so . in my opinoin , i agree it . first , idea and concept can build a good basis . second , idea and concept can direct them to a correct way . for the reason , i agree it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all , understanding idea and concept can build a good basis . if you want to do anything well , you should have a good basis , for example , building a prefect building . in fact , when a building ha a good condition , it must have a prefect basis . besieds , after you understand idea and concept , you will build a nice basis . plus , when you have a nice basis , you will be able to solve any problem you need . that 's why i think idea and concept can build a good basis . moreover , understanding idea and concept can direct them a correct way . most prblems are resulted from a incorrect way . when you want to start a thing , the key point is that if you start from a right way . however , most people often ignore this point . it always make them regret . as a result , a good begining must have a correct way . in fact , a correct way depends on how much idea and concept you understand . that 's why i think understanding idea and concept can direct them a correct way . in conclusion , i believe that you will always make a good job when you understand idea and concept . i also believe a prefect job is from a good basis and a correct way . as a result , i totally agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
