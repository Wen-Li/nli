knowledge is devine . having knowledge on differnt subject doe not lead to any confusion , rather we have more advantage . i disagree with the mentioned statement . in our day to day life we see so many change , the thing you see today might no be there tommorow , when we talk about technology the above statement is true , however there are few subject , where they remain constant , for example history , the term itself describes about past actvity . if an individual stick to this subject through out his/her life , there is posibility of not knowing the latest update of our surroundings . mastering in a specific subject is a good option , but at the same time every individual should have the basic of other subject a well . consider a small example here , say there are two student a and b. a is specialized in history and ha zero knowledge on other subject b is good at computer and also show intrest in other subject . if both were told to give a ceminar , a would be stronger only in presenting the lecture but where a when b give presentation on the same topic a a did , b 's presentation would be more affective and the reason being , b 's presentation includes a graphical representation which will strike the ordians mind with great impact . if parents have knowledge in different subject , it help their child to think , understand and analyze and if we are sticked to one topic forever , it might create a problem for u and for the younger generation . knowledge is prowerful weapon and it is an ocean and having a broad knowledge will help u in better thinking and sharing it with otheres put u one step ahead .
