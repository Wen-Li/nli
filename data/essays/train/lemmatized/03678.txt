i agree with hte statement because undrstanding idea and concept is alot better and easier than learning fact . because of many reason . first understanding the idea make easier to remember and make memorible in their brain . for example , when i understand an idea about the `` earth movement '' ican easy remember it later and explain it to another person . the second reason is if someone understand about a subject it will help him later in the future at work . for example , when we were child they tought u at school the basic of math then we understood it then know hoe to deal with big math problem nowadays . the third reason is a lot of subject need to concentrate with it and understand it such a chimstry because with this subject you neded to understand the number the word so you ca n't just lesrn the `` fact '' and if you did you make a mess . the fourth reason is , when you have an exam you will write the answer easily because you know it and biswade with it and it 's stored in your head . on the other hand `` learning fact '' is not to bad because some people are working with it work with them . but there is alot of problem with it but it can be a temprary situation then you can proceed to the better level wich it `` understanding '' . and on of the problem with learning fact that it 's not easy with math , chimstry and physic . so it wo n't help you with these subject , but also work with history a lot . so there advanteges and disadvanteges with the both . bit if we put them in a scale we will see that the `` understanding idea and concept '' is the winner style .
