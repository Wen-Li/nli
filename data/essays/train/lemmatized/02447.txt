what i think about this case is goin for the first choise which is , it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , because when a person have that knowledge about the academic subject other than in one specific subject , sure a person would have a job which ha a one specific subject for exampel , a doctor , his feild or his main subject that a doctor should be know about it is medican and body since in general , but that dose not mean he only have to know what about his job only , well whats wrong about haveing knowledge about other thing for example , a knowledge of art , how great is to find a doctor wich his clinic is full of his art work or some he bought in his own taste of art , a normal person if he walk in a place like that he would say that this doctor is not like any other doctor . having a broad knowledge is some thing really great from some to get usd from it , it can be very help ful in some position , for example some people are siting and talking about some field of studing , and they all have a knowledge about many academic subject exepet one person whose now interested to have aother knowledge of what he have , what if these people opend a subject far from this person field or specific subject , what his position would be like , and what if some of these people askd him about some thing in the other field of his , after that , that person would think that he wa wrong about stiking in one specific subject knowing all about it , from that stuiations people change their mind about what they have made . so for not being in that kind of position i agree and 100 % support having a broad knowledge of many academic subject .
