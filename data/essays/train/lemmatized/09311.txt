a lot of controversy exists over weather traveling with a group or by alone . however , i strongly believe that traveling in a group led by tour guide is more valuable than traveling without a group . when i trip with group , it can be benificial . also , i can make good relationship with my member of the group . the first reason why i would like to trip with large group is that traveling can be extremly helful for me . i get information about new place i wanted to know from the tour guide and share knowledge with my group member . this creats more beneficial traveling for everyone . for example , i visited the state last year with a group led by a tour guide . i did not have information about the place which i viewed , but the tour guide explained very carefully and friendly so that i could understanding the place 's history and charactoristics . in addition , traveling with a group make me socialize with people . when some people are in trouble during the trip , such a ill or losing money , other people can cooperate each other so that they can solve their problem easily . also , i can learn to control myself . group activity need to each person 's responsibility and ability of self control . when i do well in the group , i will be able to learn a sense of accomplishment . it is often said that traveling in a group with a tour guide ha some of nagative point . however , if i have a chance to trip , i will choose traveling with a goup of people for my enjoyable trip . it can be beneficial and it offer people to socialize with others . all we should notice that when people are traveling or exploring new place , having a tour guide and a group of people are positive influeces for their trip .
