most advertisement seem to make product seem much better than they really are . most advertisement seems to emphasize too much of their benefit or vital point in their product . to make the advertisement more effective , people work for the advertisement use more color , put overstatement about the product in good way , and use popular actor , actress , and even singer to make the effect bigger . in general , customer should not believe in too much for the advertisement itself . i have two example to show how the way advertisement work . one is that the advertisement of camel cigarette , there are actually two advertisement paper for men and woman . but the common point is that there is a man and woman who look beautiful and look cool with the cigarette on it both advertisement . the advertisement want consumer to think to be looked cool or even mature when they smoke like the model on it advertisement . the other example is about nutrition pill . there are many kind of pill or powder such a diet pill , protein powder , omega 6 pill , etc and it advertisement affect people greatly . those advertisement make people think their body look not nice even if they really do not , and let them buy those pill to loose weight or make mascle . some people might believe if they take big amount of protein powder , they would make huge muscle which they want . however , the truth is they can not . those protein powder doe not help to make more muscle . people who buy the protein power are just waisting their money . people can buy anything they want in this society . however , many of them do not realize how they are affected by those advertisement when they go shopping and choose thing to buy . customers have to know only what they really need to buy , but not for the product they think atractive because of it advertisement . be a smart shopper .
