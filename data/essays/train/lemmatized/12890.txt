i storongry agree with this statement for following several reason . nowadays , world is getting smaller due to grobalization . so people can see many advertisement . even if they are foreign company . first , when i wa kid . icould find toy that exactly i want . i called company to order it . few day leter it wa deliveried to me. however , there wa atoy which much smaller than i expected . i wa taken shock because they send me fake . i wa calling to company which i ordered . on the other hand , there were small explanetion about toy ` it may change from image '' however almost people do not pay attention so much detail . fortunally i could refund from them . so it wa s first time to know about risk of adovertisements . second , almost people who live in the society have experience which can see advertisemant of food . they are typical advertisement which look better than real . i have no memory that food were better than advertisement . so this problem is very close to our life . one time i went to eat sea food near by ocean . then i saw great picture about shupimp . so friend and i decided to go there . actually that restaurant didnt look nice . however we trusted advertisement of them . after get seat , we order the shupimp which wa advertisement . however the sarved u shupimp which le than half of it . we were so dissapointed and sad . finally , like this advertisement have possibility to get sued . it is kind of crime because they do not tell a truth . coupanies have responsibility to tell the real quality about ther work . also there are so many coumpanise all over the world . i really want they to make sure what is the justice for customer . in conclusion , nowadays , people really need to pay attention to advertisement . that is the only way to protect our expense . also they must make customer dissapoint so i really hope them to abandant this silly custom .
