advertisements today in our country and also in lot of country advertisement are very important for buying new product but some some advertisement do not show the real quality of the product so i completely agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . to my mind , advertisement is very important because if the company create new product , the people have to recognise this product . therefore the company have to make advirtesements to sell their product . because of this reason advertisement industry is very common all around the world . however , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are so buyer complain about this situation because buyer of course want to buy the right thing but the unreal advertisement cause the wrong thing . according to me the advertisement company have to be careful about the product which they will make their advertisement and they have to try the product and then they must make the their advertisement . if they do not do this , the buyer can make a mistake while they are buying this product . they can rely on the advertisement and they can buy the product which is not better . therefore all of the advertisement must be real they must not show the unreality . to sum up , all the advertisement must be real . not only the advertisement must be for earning money but also they must be for showing people the truth . for example if some kind of medicine advertisement are not be real , the buyer can have big problem because of this advertisement so the advertisement company must always be careful . if they are not do this , some big problem can occur . finally most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are but they must not this .
