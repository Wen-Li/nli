in this point of statement , i think is difficult to people who try new thing take risk . i disagree with statement because i think people try new thing have lot of avantages than only doing what they already know how to do well because when you try a thing like cloth or shoe they can see if it 's good or not and if it is their size . but only doing what they already know how to do well is extremely difficult and take risk , they just feeling if that product is good . it 's not usually feeling show that product is good even though it is new . the second one they can not taste it . maybe , after bought new think without taste and go home at far place where thing were bought what whould they do ? there many disavantage when they only doing what they already know how to do well . i prefer try new thing before , at least i would make more
