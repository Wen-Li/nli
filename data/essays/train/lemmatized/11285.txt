i do not subscribe to the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept . students should be more focussed on getting the fact right a fact hold them are unalterable and are bound to hold them good in long stead . what may seem a great idea to one person may be perceived a unfeasible and dismissed by another idea from person who ha taken a different approach . ideas can be whimsical and outlandish . they can even range from bizzare to plain absurd . it is here that fact stop whimsical idea to take flight and cause unnecessary wastage of time and effort by a team of creator . let me quote a recent example . donald trump , the real estate mogul from new york , mooted the idea of the new season of hit tv series , the apprentice on racial line . the contest wa previously held between university graduate and non degree holder . for the latest season he came up with the idea of the contest taking place between colored and white people . the idea , before it could shape up further , drew huge criticism and widespread uproar among the society a to how come racism form the basis of a tv show that is essentially a recruitment process which is broadcast all over the country and abroad forcing trump to abandon the idea and issue an apology . this idea would never have been come up , if donald trump had acquainted himself with the fact , that anything remotely racist would be condemned widespread a racism in any form is still a sensitive issue . this is not to say that idea and concept should be trashed away completely . they should be allowed to prosper only after the fact have been taken into account . facts form the basis of idea and concept and unless a student ha got his fact in place , he will not be able to come up with original and progressive idea . a building can not be stable when the very foundation of it is weak and infirm .
