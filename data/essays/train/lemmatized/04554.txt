it is more important to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact because if one is not clear with the idea , one can not get the detail of fact . understanding idea can be related to history or and event . lets say you are asked to write a detail about your country , for example india . you will be able to see the present situation that it is an independent country which is the fact but what were the consequence it underwent at the time when british people ruled the country and how did the the freedom fighter gave up their life for the independence of the country cant be achieved . so it becomes necessary to understand both fact a well a idea behind it . if one is watching a painting , one wont be able to make out the idea behind that painting but a the matter of fact he will picture it according to his own point of view . it might be that for a painter it is a painting of his family and he s expressing his view in that painting but for the viewer it might just be number of people standing . but if the student is provided with the idea and fact together than a student will learn a well a understand the concept behind it . i once experienced that one of my frind told me that my best friend is just using me for some work to be done and i started hating her for that because that wa the idea i got from the information but i could have spoke to her and understood the fact behind . just by not being aware of the fact i almost ruined my relation . so at time it become necessary to understand the whole thing than to just go with the idea . teachers have a bigger hand in using the idea and fact in a proper form to make the student aware of the importance of both the fact and idea play an equal role in understanding any concept . they can incalcate the idea from beginning so they grow and give equal importance to both .
