I. Task description
-------------------
This README file describes the Text Task for the 2017 shared task on Native Language
Identification (https://sites.google.com/site/nlisharedtask/).  The object of the task
is to predict the native language of a non-native speaker of English given an essay written
by that individual in English.  The following 11 native languages represented in the dataset:

Arabic (ARA)
Chinese (CHI)
French (FRE)
German (GER)
Hindi (HIN)
Italian (ITA)
Japanese (JPN)
Korean (KOR)
Spanish (SPA)
Telugu (TEL)
Turkish (TUR)

There are 11,000 essays (1,000 per L1) in the training partition (train) and 1,100 (100
per L1) in the development partition (dev).

The 2017 shared task on Native Language Identification will also include a Speech Task, in
which the goal is to predict a non-native speaker's native language based on the
orthographic transcription of a 45-second English utterance, as well as the Main Task,
in which the goal it to predict a non-native speaker's native language based on both an
essay and the transcription of a 45-second utterance.  The materials for the Speech Task
will be released in mid-April.

II. Reproducing the baseline
----------------------------
To run the baseline system with the default settings, navigate to the 'scripts/' directory
and run the following command:

    $ python essay_baseline.py

The script trains a linear support vector classifier using the scikit-learn library
(scikit-learn.org) using unigram features computed from the tokenized versions of the of
the essay data located in 'data/essays/train/tokenized' and evaluates its 
performance on the dev data in 'data/essays/dev/tokenized'.  A confusion matrix
and classification report are printed to the console. In addition, the feature matrix 
generated for the train and dev data is saved in svm_light format under
'data/features/train' and 'data/features/dev' respectively. 

script arguments:

  --train                      The name of the training partition directories used for 
                               reading training data and labels and writing training 
                               feature files. By default, the baseline script uses 
                               'train'.

  --test                       The name of the test partition directories used for 
                               reading test data and labels and writing dev feature 
                               files. By default, the baseline script uses 'dev'.

  --preprocessor               Name of the directory containing the processed essay 
                               data. This package comes with two options: 'original' 
                               is the unprocessed raw essay text. 'tokenized' is the 
                               sentence-and-word-segmented text. The baseline uses 
                               'tokenized' by default. To add custom preprocessing of 
                               the data, output the processed data to a new directory 
                               under '/data/essays/{train|dev}/', and pass the name of 
                               that directory to this parameter.  

  --training_features          Path to a precomputed feature file for the train 
                               partition, in svm_light format. It must have the 
                               same number of rows, in the same order, as the 
                               corresponding labels files. To avoid dimensionality 
                               mismatch, training_features and test_features files 
                               must be provided together. If only one is provided, 
                               the script will ignore it and re-compute features from 
                               the data.

  --test_features:             Path to a precomputed feature file for the test 
                               partition, in svm_light format. It must have the 
                               same number of rows, in the same order, as the 
                               corresponding labels files. To avoid dimensionality 
                               mismatch, training_features and test_features files 
                               must be provided together. If only one is provided, 
                               the script will ignore it and re-compute features from 
                               the data.

  --feature_outfile_name:      Custom name for feature files generated by script. 
                               The script will prepend the appropriate partition name to 
                               each of the feature files. If no feature_outfile_name is given,
                               the feature files will be named using the date and time.

 --predictions_outfile_name:   Custom name for predictions file (will be saved in
                               ../predictions/essays/). If not provided, the predictions
                               file will be named using the date and time.
